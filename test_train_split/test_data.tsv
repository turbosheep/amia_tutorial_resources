4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	The IFN-stimulated gene ubiquitin-specific proteinase 18 (USP18) encodes a protein that negatively regulates T1 IFN signaling via stearic inhibition of JAK1 recruitment to the IFN-receptor 2 subunit (IFNAR2). Here, we demonstrate that USP18 expression is induced by HIV-1 in a T1 IFN-dependent manner. Experimental depletion of USP18 by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing results in a significant restriction of HIV-1 replication in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophage model. In the absence of USP18, macrophages have increased responsiveness to stimulation with T1 IFNs with prolonged phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes that are key for antiviral responses. Interestingly, HIV-1 requires some signaling through the T1 IFN receptor to replicate efficiently because a neutralizing antibody that inhibits T1 IFN activity reduces HIV-1 replication rate in monocyte-derived macrophages. USP18 induction by HIV-1 tunes the IFN response to optimal levels allowing for efficient transcription from the HIV-1 LTR promoter while minimizing the T1 IFN-induced antiviral response that would otherwise restrict viral replication and spread. Finally, iPSC and CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting offer a powerful tool to study host factors that regulate innate immune responses.
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect numerous mammalian and avian 23 species and are capable of causing severe and lethal disease in humans. CoVs encode several 24 innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate 25 efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' 26 exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for 27 high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses 28 that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, 29 we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune 30 response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular 31 pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus 32 replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially 33 restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication 34 did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, 35 ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-36 ) virus generated from IFN-β pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased 37 relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to 38 establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for 39 resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA 40 sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity. 41 42 43 IMPORTANCE 44 CoVs encode multiple antagonists that prevent or disrupt an efficient innate response. 45 Additionally, no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines currently exist for human CoV 46 infections. Therefore, the study of CoV innate immune antagonists is essential for understanding 47 how CoVs overcome host defenses and to maximize potential therapeutic interventions. Here, we 48 sought to determine the contributions of nsp14 ExoN activity in the induction of and resistance 49 to the innate immune response. We show that viruses lacking nsp14-ExoN activity are more 50 sensitive to restriction by exogenous IFN-β and that viruses produced in the presence of an 51 antiviral state are less capable of establishing a subsequent viral infection. Our results support the 52 hypothesis that MHV ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response. 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66

646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	Protein microbicides containing neutralizing antibodies and antiviral lectins may help to reduce the rate of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if it is possible to manufacture the components in large quantities at a cost affordable in HIV-endemic regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. We expressed the antiviral lectin griffithsin (GRFT), which shows potent neutralizing activity against HIV, in the endosperm of transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa), to determine whether rice can be used to produce inexpensive GRFT as a microbicide ingredient. The yield of OS GRFT in the best-performing plants was 223 lg/g dry seed weight. We also established a onestep purification protocol, achieving a recovery of 74% and a purity of 80%, which potentially could be developed into a larger-scale process to facilitate inexpensive downstream processing. OS GRFT bound to HIV glycans with similar efficiency to GRFT produced in Escherichia coli. Wholecell assays using purified OS GRFT and infectivity assays using crude extracts of transgenic rice endosperm confirmed that both crude and pure OS GRFT showed potent activity against HIV and the crude extracts were not toxic towards human cell lines, suggesting they could be administered as a microbicide with only minimal processing. A freedom-to-operate analysis confirmed that GRFT produced in rice is suitable for commercial development, and an economic evaluation suggested that 1.8 kg/ha of pure GRFT could be produced from rice seeds. Our data therefore indicate that rice could be developed as an inexpensive production platform for GRFT as a microbicide component.
c3dc1d45a1215653898cdd1859c74b0830a8b080	Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) imposes a major health concern in areas with very poor sanitation in Africa and Asia. The pathogen is transmitted mainly through ingesting contaminated water or food, coming into contact with affected people, and blood transfusions. Very few reports including old reports are available on the prevalence of HEV in Saudi Arabia in humans and no reports exist on HEV prevalence in camels. Dromedary camel trade and farming are increasing in Saudi Arabia with importation occurring unidirectionally from Africa to Saudi Arabia. DcHEV transmission to humans has been reported in one case from the United Arab Emeritus (UAE). This instigated us to perform this investigation of the seroprevalence of HEV in imported and domestic camels in Saudi Arabia. Serum samples were collected from imported and domestic camels. DcHEV-Abs were detected in collected sera using ELISA. The prevalence of DcHEV in the collected samples was 23.1% with slightly lower prevalence in imported camels than domestic camels (22.4% vs. 25.4%, p value = 0.3). Gender was significantly associated with the prevalence of HEV in the collected camels (p value = 0.015) where males (31.6%) were more infected than females (13.4%). This study is the first study to investigate the prevalence of HEV in dromedary camels from Saudi Arabia. The high seroprevalence of DcHEV in dromedaries might indicate their role as a zoonotic reservoir for viral infection to humans. Future HEV seroprevalence studies in humans are needed to investigate the role of DcHEV in the Saudi human population.
0f40702e4fe670477663f60a748e55dcd521722b	Coronavirus envelope (E) protein is a small integral membrane protein with multi-functions in virion assembly, morphogenesis and virus-host interaction. Different coronavirus E proteins share striking similarities in biochemical properties and biological functions, but seem to adopt distinct membrane topology. In this report, we study the membrane topology of the SARS-CoV E protein by immunofluorescent staining of cells differentially permeabilized with detergents and proteinase K protection assay. It was revealed that both the N-and C-termini of the SARS-CoV E protein are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membranes (N cyto C cyto ). In contrast, parallel experiments showed that the E protein from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spanned the membranes once, with the N-terminus exposed luminally and the C-terminus exposed cytoplasmically (N exo(lum) -C cyto ). Intriguingly, a minor proportion of the SARS-CoV E protein was found to be modified by N-linked glycosylation on Asn 66 and inserted into the membranes once with the C-terminus exposed to the luminal side. The presence of two distinct membrane topologies of the SARS-CoV E protein may provide a useful clue to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.
933ee695474334663ba94ac5985cf3c03fe402a9	Coronaviride is a colossal family of viruses that cause a variety of diseases in humans and other animals. As of late, a novel coronavirus, not anterior-optically discerned in humans, has been identified in a denizen of the Middle East. There is growing evidence that the Camelus dromedarius is host species for the virus and plays an important role of a source of human infection. Along these lines, the authors decided to detect coronaviruses in dromedary camels in two high-risk areas of Iran by employing an reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. In the present study, nasal swab specimens were collected from 98 camels (C. dromedarius) traditionally reared in southeast and northwest of Iran. The detection of pancoronavirus was carried out, using RT-PCR. Pancoronavirus RNA was observed in seven cases among 98 nasal swab samples. Among these, 4 positive samples belonged to Azerbaijan province located in northwest of Iran and 3 positive samples were taken from southeast of Iran. The results of this study contribute to raising the hypothesis to the extent of transmission and risk factors for human infection and public health in Iran.
07e425b0a2cb18dc7e27723172b276c1c1c4487a	Noroviruses are now recognized as the major cause of acute gastroenteritis in the developed world, yet our ability to prevent and control infection is limited. Recent work has highlighted that, while typically an acute infection in the population, immunocompromised patients often experience long-term infections that may last many years. This cohort of patients and those regularly exposed to infectious material, for example, care workers and others, would benefit greatly from the development of a vaccine or antiviral therapy. While a licensed vaccine or antiviral has yet to be developed, work over the past 10 years in this area has intensified and trials with a vaccine candidate have proven promising. Numerous antiviral targets and small molecule inhibitors that have efficacy in cell culture have now been identified; however, further studies in this area are required in order to make these suitable for clinical use.
69cc14915ab5b7184d9ec5cdb0be98279ccee0a5	The ongoing moratorium on gain-of-function (GOF) research with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn attention to the current debate on these research practices and the potential benefits and risks they present. While much of the discussion has been steered by members of the microbiology and policy communities, additional input from medical practitioners will be highly valuable toward developing a broadly inclusive policy that considers the relative value and harm of GOF research. This review attempts to serve as a primer on the topic for the clinical community by providing a historical context for GOF research, summarizing concerns about its risks, and surveying the medical products that it has yielded.

In many European countries and the US, the burden of Covid-19 epidemic could be much lower if Governments had been able to learn from the China and Lombardy stories and to declare full lockdown without delays. Methods. We use a simple game-theoretic framework for the strategic interaction between the Government, political oppositions and lobbies, combined with a Covid-19 transmission model, to analyse the role of political factors delaying the lockdown declaration, depending on the degrees of "responsibility" of political actors.
656d51738d99ab844ae143615bf4c4a40b1e1fec	Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been isolated from nearly all visceral and mucocutaneous sites. The clinical manifestations and course of HSV infections depend on the anatomic site of the infection, the age and immune status of the host, and the antigenic type of the virus [1]. Herpes simplex virus is a DNA-type virus that belongs to the human herpes virus (HHV) group. The most wellknown HHV are HSV types 1 and 2 and HHV type 3 (varicella-zoster virus). HSV 1 and 2 become latent in trigeminal and lumbosacral dorsal-root ganglia after a primary infection of the oropharynx leading to gingivostomatitis and/or pharyngitis (HSV1) or of the genital region (HSV2) [2] . From autopsy reports dating back to the early 1970s, it is known that herpes simplex virus may cause pneumonia [3, 4] . It was thought that all HSV-related pneumonias were the result of reactivation of the virus due to a diminished immune state or through local airway trauma [5, 6, 7] . Later reports did indeed show an association of HSV infection with an immunosuppressed
ca7306deb3be5e90a3e2d56596f9afb034dd9ed5	The Golgi apparatus maintains a highly organized structure in spite of the intense membrane traffic which flows into and out of this organelle. Resident Golgi proteins must have localization signals to ensure that they are targeted to the correct Golgi compartment and not swept further along the secretory pathway. There are a number of distinct groups of Golgi membrane proteins, including glycosyltransferases, recycling trans-Gotgi network proteins, peripheral membrane proteins, receptors and viral glycoproteins. Recent studies indicate that there are a number of different Golgi localization signals and mechanisms for retaining proteins to the Golgi apparatus. This review focuses on the current knowledge in this field.
5d8c09e4d7b33c68c96b4d163658eaa45b5b5739	The world faces an exceptional new public health concern caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequently termed the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although the clinical symptoms mostly have been characterized, the scientific community still doesn´t know how SARS-CoV-2 successfully reaches and spreads throughout the central nervous system (CNS) inducing brain damage. The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in frontal lobe sections from postmortem examination has confirmed the presence of the virus in neural tissue. This finding reveals a new direction in the search for a neurotherapeutic strategy in the COVID-19 patients with underlying diseases. Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in a neuroinvasiveness context and suggest the therapeutic use of high doses of melatonin, which may favorably modulate the immune response and neuroinflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, clinical trials elucidating the efficacy of melatonin in the prevention and clinical management in the COVID-19 patients should be actively encouraged.

Psychological aspects for the public health emergency operated through counselling psychologists to manage mental health, emotional, psychological, cognitive, behavioural, relational and social impacts are fundamental. And the role of counselling psychologists in maintaining personal mental health and their clients is a crucial indicator of collective wellbeing. This perspective is embedded in the gendered approach and feminist framework which attempts to explore and offer the embodied intersectional and divergent impact on living during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.
a884c249fa09caa0282b8cd422ffddeac33e5405	COVID-19 presents herculean challenges to research and scientific communities for producing diagnostic and treatment solutions. Any return to normalcy requires rapid development of countermeasures, with animal models serving as a critical tool in testing vaccines and therapeutics. Animal disease status and potential COVID-19 exposure prior to study execution may severely bias efficacy testing. We developed a toolbox of immunological and molecular tests to monitor countermeasure impact on disease outcome and evaluate prechallenge COVID-19 status. Assay application showed critical necessity for animal prescreening. Specifically, real-time PCR results documented pre-exposure of an African Green Monkey prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge with sequence confirmation as a community-acquired exposure. Longitudinal monitoring of nasopharyngeal swabs and serum showed pre-exposure impacted both viral disease course and resulting immunological response. This study demonstrates utility in a comprehensive pre-screening strategy for animal models, which captured the first documented case of community-acquired, non-human primate infection.
6bf7eb57bcb46ac71e49305ef93f2acafc869e9b	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging zoonotic disease distributed in sub-Saharan African countries and the Arabian Peninsula. The disease is caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) of the family Bunyaviridae and the genus Phlebovirus. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, and virus replication in domestic ruminant results in high rates of mortality and abortion. RVFV infection in humans usually causes a self-limiting, acute and febrile illness; however, a small number of cases progress to neurological disorders, partial or complete blindness, hemorrhagic fever, or thrombosis. This review describes the pathology of RVF in human patients and several animal models, and summarizes the role of viral virulence factors and host factors that affect RVFV pathogenesis.

f617fbea70da0b41aa8d3e701acf12bd03fcd901	While preliminary choices were essentially based on in vitro potency, clinical translation into effective therapies may be challenging due to unfavorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties at the doses chosen for this new indication of COVID-19 infection. However, available pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies suffer from severe limitations leading to unreliable conclusions, especially in term of dosing optimization. In this paper we propose to highlight these limitations and to identify some of the major requirements that need to be addressed in designing PK and PK-PD studies in this era of COVID. A special attention should be paid to pre-analytical and analytical requirements and to the proper collection of covariates affecting dose-exposure relationships (co-medications, use of specific organ support techniques and other clinical and para-clinical data). We also promote the development of population PK and PK-PD models specifically dedicated to COVID-19 patients since those previously developed for other diseases (SEL, malaria, HIV) and clinical situations (steadystate, non-ICU patients) are not representative of severe patients. Therefore, implementation of well-designed PK and PD studies targeted to COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. For that purpose we call for multi-institutional collaborative work and involvement of clinical pharmacologists in multidisciplinary research consortia.
e22140a30bea1676104edacd5240407c1f0d36a5	EMR2 is an EGF-like module containing mucin-like hormone receptor-2 precursor, a G-protein coupled receptor (G-PCR). Mutation in EMR2 causes complicated disorders like polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The structure of EMR2 shows that the fifth domain is comprised of EGF-TM7 helices. Functional assignment of EMR2 by support vector machine (SVM) revealed that along with transporter activity, several novel functions are predicted. A twenty amino acid sequence "MGGRVFLVFLAFCVWLTLPG" acts as the signal peptide responsible for posttranslational transport. Eight amino acids are involved in N-glycosylation sites and two cleavage sites are Leu517 and Ser518 in EMR2. The residue Arg241 is responsible for interaction with glycosaminoglycan and chondroitin sulfate. On the basis of structure, function and ligand binding sites, competitive EMR2 inhibitors designed may decrease the rate of human diseases like Usher's syndrome, bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria and PKD.
87cc0af9cce74ce6cbd754eb4e38e4e2ebb652e2	Original Research; Thoracic Imaging J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights • In our experience chest CT had a significantly higher specificity and accuracy in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia than previously reported. • Chest CT and RT-PCR positive rates were 485/773 (62.7%) and 462/773 (59.7%), respectively. • CT sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR as reference were 90.7% [95% IC, 87.7% to 93.2%], 78.8% [95% IC, 73.8-83.2%], 86.4% [95% IC, 76.1% -88.9%], 85.1% [95% IC, 81.0% -88.4] and 85.9% [95% IC 83.2-88.3%], respectively. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Abstract Objectives: The goal of this study was to assess chest computed tomography (CT) diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice using RT-PCR as standard of reference. Methods: From March 4 th to April 9 th 2020, during the peak of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic, we enrolled a series of 773 patients that performed both non-contrast chest CT and RT-PCR with a time interval no longer than a week due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The diagnostic performance of CT was evaluated according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy, considering RT-PCR as the reference standard. An analysis on the patients with discrepant CT scan and RT-PCR result and on the patient with both negative tests was performed. Results: RT-PCR testing showed an overall positive rate of 59.8%. CT sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 90.7% [95% IC, 87.7% to 93.2%], 78.8% [95% IC, 73.8-83.2%], 86.4% [95% IC, 76.1% -88.9%], 85.1% [95% IC, 81.0% -88.4] and 85.9% [95% IC 83.2-88.3%], respectively. Twenty-five/66 (37.6%) patients with positive CT and negative RT-PCR results and 12/245 (4.9%) patients with both negative tests were nevertheless judged as positive cases by the clinicians based on clinical and epidemiological criteria and consequently treated. Conclusions: In our experience, in a context of high pre-test probability, CT scan shows good sensitivity and a consistently higher specificity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia than what reported by previous studies, especially when clinical and epidemiological features are taken into account.
aeb07536684de70403a864d1827befdae2e9b1c5	The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty regarding the safety and appropriate utilization of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) during this current outbreak. Surgical governing bodies such as Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and the Royal Colleges of Surgery of Great Britain and Ireland have made statements regarding the possibility of COVID-19 release into CO2 insufflant during MIS. The basis for this concern is prior evidence in the literature of other viral pathogen release during laparoscopic surgery. The recommendations are correctly based on caution given the lack of understanding of how COVID-19 compares to other viruses with regard to transmission and presence in CO2 during MIS. In this review we have investigated the available literature on COVID-19 transmission during MIS, address the implications of current and previously published recommendations and discuss steps to mitigate COVID-19 transmission during MIS for staff and patient safety.

94dbfda8ba9ff72cc0418e1abba4784099d9eb1c	Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate pain, functional impairment, mental health, and daily activity in patients with end-stage hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods The study included 63 patients, with hip or knee OA, who had been scheduled for arthroplasty that was postponed because of COVID-19. Patients were evaluated by telephone interviews during the first week after lockdown, in the fourth week, and again at the end of the lockdown. Patients rated their pain level on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS) and completed WOMAC, SF-12 and Tegner activity scale (TAS) questionnaires. Results VAS and WOMAC scores increased significantly during lockdown, while physical activity significantly decreased. At the final evaluation, VAS and WOMAC showed a significant negative correlation with TAS. The SF-12 subscale scores showed a significant decrease of the physical component during the lockdown, while the mental component remained largely unchanged. Patients with knee OA showed a faster progress of pain compared to those with hip OA. 50 patients (79%) stated they wished to have arthroplasty as soon as possible. Conclusion The COVID-19 lockdown had a significant impact on pain, joint function, physical function, and physical activity in patients with end-stage hip and knee OA. Level of evidence II (Prospective cohort study).
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	This study investigated healthcare workers' perceptions of hand hygiene practices by comparing personal reports, as assessed by questionnaires, to direct observations of the workers' hand hygiene practices. The study employed a cross-sectional research design. Observations were made using a 16-item checklist, based on three sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and Boyce and Pittet's guidelines of hand hygiene. The checklist was used for both direct-observation and self-reported data collection purposes. Pearson correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) were utilized to statistically determine the relationship between healthcare workers' reports of hand hygiene practices and observed hand hygiene behaviors. The study was conducted in the outpatient examination rooms and emergency departments of three types of hospitals in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia where Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic and is observed in routine cases and outbreaks. The total sample size included 87 physicians and nurses recruited while on duty during the scheduled observation periods, with each healthcare worker being observed during individual medical examinations with at least three patients. No statistically significant correlations between the healthcare workers' perceptions of hand hygiene practices and healthcare workers' actual behaviors were evident. Based on the self-report questionnaires, significant differences were found between physicians' and nurses' hand hygiene practices reports. Healthcare workers clearly understand the importance of careful hand hygiene practices, but based on researchers' observations, the medical personnel failed to properly implement protocol-driven hand hygiene applications. However, the significant differences between physicians' and nurses' self-reports suggest further inquiry is needed to fully explore these discrepancies.
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	The coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic has led many countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the outbreak. Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public discourse. Datadriven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different lockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and informing governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper develops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown policies in a global context -we treat each country as a distinct data point, and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific policy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior -the lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) model as a prior mean function with "country-andpolicy-specific" parameters that capture fatality curves under "counterfactual" policies within each country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and learns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and its policy indicators. Our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of SEIR models (Bayesian priors) with the flexible data-driven modeling and gradient-based optimization routines of machine learning (Bayesian posteriors) -i.e., the entire model is trained end-to-end via stochastic variational inference. We compare the projections of COVID-19 fatalities by our model with other models listed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and provide scenario analyses for various lockdown and reopening strategies highlighting their impact on COVID-19 fatalities. * Equal contribution.

0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced radiology volumes across the country as providers have decreased elective care in order to minimize the spread of infection and free up health care delivery system capacity. Following the stay-at-home order in our county, imaging volumes at our institution decreased to approximately 46% of baseline volumes, similar to the experience of other radiology practices. Given the substantial differences in severity and timing of the disease in different geographic regions, estimating resumption of radiology volumes will be one of the next major challenges for radiology practices. We hypothesize that there are 6 major variables that will likely predict radiology volumes: (1) severity of disease in the local region, including potential subsequent "waves" of infection, (2) lifting of government social distancing restrictions, (3) patient concern regarding risk of leaving home and entering imaging facilities, (4) management of pent up demand for imaging delayed during the acute phase of the pandemic, including institutional capacity, (5) impact of the economic downturn on health insurance and ability to pay for imaging, and (6) radiology practice profile reflecting amount of elective imaging performed, including type of patients seen by the radiology practice such as emergency/inpatient/outpatient mix and sub-specialty types. We encourage radiology practice leaders to use these and other relevant variables to plan for the coming weeks and to work collaboratively with local health system and governmental leaders to help ensure that needed patient care is restored as quickly as the environment will safely permit.

683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	Background: WU virus (WUV) and KI polyomavirus (KIPyV) are newly discovered related human polyomaviruses detected in respiratory samples. To investigate their potential role in respiratory disease, we determined their frequencies of detection, clinical presentations and epidemiological characteristics among samples referred for diagnostic respiratory virus testing. Methods: Anonymised samples and accompanying study subject information were obtained from the Edinburgh respiratory specimen archive. Samples were screened by nested PCR using two sets of primers conserved between WUV and KIPyV, as well for other respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenoviruses [AdV], influenza A/B and parainfluenza viruses 1-3, human bocavirus, B19). Results and Conclusions: WUV and KIPyV were detected in 10 and 14 samples, respectively from 983 specimens (from 9 to 10 different individuals from 612 study subjects). Infections occurred in two types of study subject; those who were young (<2 years) with lower respiratory tract infections (n = 8), and almost invariably co-infected with other respiratory viruses (RSV, AdV), and a second, generally older group either without respiratory disease (n = 6) or with mild upper respiratory tract infections (n = 5) but who were generally clinically severely immunosuppressed from leukaemia or transplant therapy. Findings from either group do not support an aetiological link between infection with WUV or KIPyV and respiratory disease.
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	Background: Rabbits are cecotrophic, hindgut-fermenters that rely heavily on their gastrointestinal microbiota for optimal digestion of plant-based diets. Dysbiosis, caused by disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota, is known to predispose rabbits to rabbit enteritis complex (REC), a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings (commercial meat, companion, laboratory, and shelter) and to identify how factors such as age, season, and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition. Results: A total of 86 pooled commercial meat, 54 companion, 14 pooled laboratory, and 14 shelter rabbit fecal samples were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 region. In all sample types, the predominant bacterial phylum was Firmicutes. Other commonly identified phyla (composing ≥ 1% of the total microbiota composition) were Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Significant differences in composition were noted between commercial, companion, laboratory, and shelter rabbit samples for proportions of Verrucomicrobia (P < 0.01), Proteobacteria (P < 0.01), and Lentisphaerae (P = 0.01) within the total microbiota. Within the commercial meat rabbit samples, significant differences between the microbiota composition of growers (n = 42) and does (n = 44) were limited to one unclassified Firmicutes (P = 0.03) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Significant differences were present between fecal samples taken from rabbits during the summer (n = 44) compared to the winter (n = 42), with Firmicutes (P = 0.04), Verrucomicrobia (P = 0.03), Proteobacteria (P = 0.02), Deinococcus-Thermus (P = 0.04), Armatimonadates (P = 0.003), and Actinobacteria (P = 0.03) forming significantly different proportions of the microbiota. The only significant difference in composition between those farms that routinely reported antimicrobial use and those that did not was in one unclassified Bacteroidetes (P < 0.05) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Conclusions: Rabbit husbandry and diet, in addition to season, significantly influence the fecal microbiota composition of domestic rabbits, while age of the rabbit post-weaning has minimal impact.
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	Despite causing pandemics and yearly epidemics that result in significant morbidity and mortality, our arsenal of options to treat influenza A virus (IAV) infections remains limited and is challenged by the virus itself. While vaccination is the preferred intervention strategy against influenza, its efficacy is reduced in the elderly and infants who are most susceptible to severe and/or fatal infections. In addition, antigenic variation of IAV complicates the production of efficacious vaccines. Similarly, effectiveness of currently used antiviral drugs is jeopardized by the development of resistance to these drugs. Like many viruses, IAV is reliant on host factors and signaling-pathways for its replication, which could potentially offer alternative options to treat infections. While host-factors have long been recognized as attractive therapeutic candidates against other viruses, only recently they have been targeted for development as IAV antivirals. Future strategies to combat IAV infections will most likely include approaches that alter host-virus interactions on the one hand or dampen harmful host immune responses on the other, with the use of biological response modifiers (BRMs). In principle, BRMs are biologically active agents including antibodies, small peptides, and/or other (small) molecules that can influence the immune response. BRMs are already being used in the clinic to treat malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Repurposing such agents would allow for accelerated use against severe and potentially fatal IAV infections. In this review, we will address the potential therapeutic use of different BRM classes to modulate the immune response induced after IAV infections.

41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	The purpose of this study was to investigate the components of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), liver function and histology in liver fibrogenesis in the rats induced by low-dose chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCL 4 ) administration and evaluate the relationship between biochemical variables and components of RAS. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the CCL 4 group which received intraperitoneal injection of 40% CCL 4 dissolved in olive oil every three days for four consecutive weeks (Initial dose was 5 mL/kg, other dose: 3 mL/kg) and the control group which received the same dose of olive oil. The micro-structure of the liver was examined by H&E. Hepatic Ang II and Ang(1-7) was detected. Realtime PCR and Western-blot were performed to determine the gene and protein expression of the RAS. The components of RAS were all up-regulated in CCL 4 group, and the increased extent of ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis was higher than the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axis. There was a significant correlation between ACE and ACE2 gene expression, AT1 and MAS gene expression, Ang II and Ang(1-7) in the liver of rats. ACE (or ACE2) gene expression strongly correlated with the index of liver injury significantly. These results suggest hepatic fibrogenesis induced by chronic CCL 4 administration may be associated with the relationship of ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis and ACE2-Ang(1-7)-MAS axis.
d4b50ef79735dfe99adea35bf7fa89ea18703a3e	Much of an interpolation engine for bit-vector (BV) arithmetic can be constructed by observing that BV arithmetic can be modeled with linear integer arithmetic (LIA). Two BV formulae can thus be translated into two LIA formulae and then an interpolation engine for LIA used to derive an interpolant, albeit one expressed in LIA. The construction is completed by back-translating the LIA interpolant into a BV formula whose models coincide with those of the LIA interpolant. This paper develops a back-translation algorithm showing, for the first time, how back-translation can be universally applied, whatever the LIA interpolant. This avoids the need for deriving a BV interpolant by bit-blasting the BV formulae, as a backup process when back-translation fails. The new back-translation process relies on a novel geometric technique, called gapping, the correctness and practicality of which are demonstrated.
bf5ace4266edf2898e0d391f7d47bce415917751	This chapter provides an overview of basic virology along with a primer on the numerous viruses that cause significant human disease. Viruses are grouped in terms of their genomic organization in order to facilitate a discussion of both the molecular and pathogenic aspects of their biology. In addition to increasing our understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis and rational drug design, the detailed molecular characterization of these pathogens has provided the potential to identify molecular signatures that can be used to trace outbreaks of viral disease.

71e6e60a23930e05c2a2274b989a9aece9955518	In light of the COVID-19 pandemic that has struck the world since the end of 2019, many endeavors have been carried out to overcome this crisis. Taking into consideration the uncertainty as a feature of forecasting, this data article introduces long-term time-series predictions for the virus's daily infections in Brazil by training forecasting models on limited raw data (30 time-steps and 40 time-steps alternatives). The primary reuse potential of this forecasting data is to enable decision-makers to develop action plans against the pandemic, and to help researchers working in infection prevention and control to: 1) explore limited data usage in predicting infections. 2) develop a reinforcement learning model on top of this data-lake, which can perform an online game between the trained models to generate a new capable model for predicting future true data. The prediction data was generated by training 4200 recurrent neural networks (54 to 84 days validation periods) on raw data from Johns Hopkins University's online repository, to pave the way for generating reliable extended long-term predictions. The prediction tables, graphs, metadata files were generated by a developed code for a recursive inference function. -Raw: The generated prediction data Parameters for data collection -The metadata and training -inference settings for the deterministic setup are located in the settings folder in the data repository.
82ddfda23359b76b14cd3fce9119dc315d258819	Ubiquitin mediated signaling contributes critically to host cell defenses during pathogen infection. Many pathogens manipulate the ubiquitin system to evade these defenses. Here we characterize a likely effector protein bearing a deubiquitylase (DUB) domain from the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus. The Ulp1like DUB prefers ubiquitin substrates over ubiquitin-like proteins and efficiently cleaves polyubiquitin chains of three or more ubiquitins. The co-crystal structure of the DUB (OtDUB) domain with ubiquitin revealed three bound ubiquitins: one engages the S1 site, the second binds an S2 site contributing to chain specificity and the third binds a unique ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). The UBD modulates OtDUB activity, undergoes a pronounced structural transition upon binding ubiquitin, and binds monoubiquitin with an unprecedented~5 nM dissociation constant. The characterization and high-resolution structure determination of this enzyme should aid in its development as a drug target to counter Orientia infections.
330a49685a269070206fdd0f4bba345e96bf492f	Viruses are completely dependent on their host cells for the successful production of progeny viruses. At each stage of the viral life cycle an intricate interplay between virus and host takes place with the virus aiming to usurp the host cell for its purposes and the host cell trying to block the intruder from propagation. In recent years these interactions have been studied on a global level by systems biology approaches, such as RNA interference screens, transcriptomic or proteomic methodologies, and exciting new insights into the pathogenhost relationship have been revealed. In this review, we summarize the available data, give examples for important findings from such studies and point out current limitations and potential future directions.
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	The significance of the integral membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) in the ebolavirus entry process has been determined using various cell lines derived from humans, nonhuman primates and fruit bats. Fruit bats have long been purported as the potential reservoir host for ebolaviruses, however several studies provide evidence that Mops condylurus, an insectivorous microbat, is also an ebolavirus reservoir. NPC1 receptor expression in the context of ebolavirus replication in microbat cells remains unstudied. In order to study Ebola virus (EBOV) cellular entry and replication in M. condylurus, we derived primary and immortalized cell cultures from 12 different organs. The NPC1 receptor expression was characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry comparing the expression levels of M. condylurus primary and immortalized cells, HeLa cells, human embryonic kidney cells and cells from a European microbat species. EBOV replication kinetics was studied for four representative cell cultures using qRT-PCR. The aim was to elucidate the suitability of primary and immortalized cells from different tissues for studying NPC1 receptor expression levels and their potential influence on EBOV replication. The NPC1 receptor expression level in M. condylurus primary cells differed depending on the organ they were derived from and was for most cell types significantly lower than in human cell lines. Immortalized cells showed for most cell types higher expression levels than their corresponding primary cells. Concluding from our infection experiments with EBOV we suggest a potential correlation between NPC1 receptor expression level and virus replication rate in vitro. Although there have been Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks for more than 40 years, the animal natural reservoir that maintains this virus in nature has not been identified. Viruses PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.and their respective reservoirs coevolve over millions of years, often without causing diseases in the reservoir itself. Upon entering a new host, infection can have devastating consequences, as in the case of EBOV. To gain entry into cells prior to replication, all ebolaviruses utilize the cellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). In this study the authors focus their work on the Angolan free-tailed bat (Mops condylurus) as a potential reservoir for EBOV. Cells from various organs of this bat were isolated in culture and tested for the presence of NPC1. Most bat cell types had a lower amount of NPC1 compared to the tested human cells. These bat cells were also less efficiently infected by EBOV, indicating adaptation to EBOV. These results suggest low levels of virus replication in the respective tissues of M. condylurus and might be indicative of a virus-natural reservoir relationship.

18e4419762c2aa263e4b3695666d1dd945fb61bf	Two different strains of Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) were inoculated into swine tracheal organ culture. Both viruses replicated in and destroyed the tracheal epithelium and epithelial cells. ADV antigen was first localized in ciliated epi.thelial cells by fluorescent antibody and immunopero×idase examinations. Corresponding to the distribution of ADV antigen, many ADV particles were observed in ciliated epithelial cells. Results demonstrated that the tracheal epithelium infected with ADV is reduced in its ciliary activity.
62219dc0553022e4faac2b1523e7e0a2d1eaec30	Since the progression of cirrhosis is accelerated each time a complication recurs, the management and treatment of the complication is critical in enhancement of the quality of life and expectation of life in patients. The use of model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium (MELD-Na) with physiological indicators can be used to assess severity and differentiate therapeutic interventions. This study is aimed to determine the mean survival period and cumulative survival rate by classifying patients into high-risk and lowrisk groups based on MELD-Na, a predictor of mortality in liver disease, and to investigate the mortality prognostic factors. A retrospective cohort study, which follows the STROBE checklist, was performed. 263 patients who were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis complications for the first time and hospitalized were selected as the subjects of this study. The collected data were analyzed based on the survival package provided by the statistical program R version 3.4.2. Subjects were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups using MELD-Na 14 points where sensitivity and specificity crossed the cut-off point. Gender, age, and primary caregiver were significant variables in the mortality high-risk group, and AST, albumin, and primary caregiver were significant variables in the mortality low-risk group. Based on these mortality prognostic factors, it is possible to present the factors affecting mortality in patients who were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis complications for the first time. The classification of patients by risk level could be the foundation to provide accurate guidelines for management and it is necessary to modify prognostic factors and apply nursing interventions to manage complications. Abbreviations: AST = aspartate transferase, MELD-Na = model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium.
1a14987c5f85168b76eb67671d428a8a22d602fb	This systematic review summarizes the evidence on the earliest patients with COVID-19-HIV co-infection. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, preprint databases, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019, to June 1, 2020. From an initial 547 publications and 75 reports, 25 studies provided specific information on COVID-19 patients living with HIV. Studies described 252 patients, 80.9% were male, the mean age was 52.7 years, and 98% were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Co-morbidities in addition to HIV and COVID-19 (multimorbidity) included hypertension (39.3%), obesity or hyperlipidemia (19.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18.0%), and diabetes (17.2%). Two-thirds (66.5%) had mild to moderate symptoms, the most common being fever (74.0%) and cough (58.3%). Among patients who died, the majority (90.5%) were over 50 years old, male (85.7%), and had multimorbidity (64.3%). Our findings highlight the importance of identifying co-infections, addressing co-morbidities, and ensuring a secure supply of ART for PLHIV during the COVID-19 pandemic.
7a0da4f2fa4aa0d32a6590cc1fbe33fcb1bf2b86	A crowdsourced stream processing system (CSP) is a system that incorporates crowdsourced tasks in the processing of a data stream. This can be seen as enabling crowdsourcing work to be applied on a sample of large-scale data at high speed, or equivalently, enabling stream processing to employ human intelligence. It also leads to a substantial expansion of the capabilities of data processing systems. Engineering a CSP system requires the combination of human and machine computation elements. From a general systems theory perspective, this means taking into account inherited as well as emerging properties from both these elements. In this paper, we position CSP systems within a broader taxonomy, outline a series of design principles and evaluation metrics, present an extensible framework for their design, and describe several design patterns. We showcase the capabilities of CSP systems by performing a case study that applies our proposed framework to the design and analysis of a real system (AIDR) that classifies social media messages during time-critical crisis events. Results show that compared to a pure stream processing system, AIDR can achieve a higher data classification accuracy, while compared to a pure crowdsourcing solution, the system makes better use of human workers by requiring much less manual work effort.
ce0774cad7bb264165679058994f79b8b10a6b7d	The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation has presented multiple imminent challenges to the nations around the globe. While health agencies around the world are exploring various options to contain the spread of this fatal viral infection, multiple strategies and guidelines are being issued to boost the fight against the disease. Identifying and isolating infected individuals at an early phase of the disease has been a very successful approach to stop the chain of transmission. But this approach faces a practical challenge of limited resources. Sample pooling solves this enigma by significantly improving the testing capacity and result turn around time while using no extra resources. However, the general sample pooling method also has the scope of significant improvements. This article describes a process to further optimize the resources with optimal sample pooling. This is a userfriendly technique, scalable on a national or international scale. A mathematical model has been built and validated for its performance using clinical data.
185e505daa1da8ee7ece18212693b2550410a190	Flaviviridae family that has been known to circulate for decades causing mild febrile illness. the more recent ZiKV outbreaks in the Americas and the caribbean associated with congenital malformations and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults have placed public health officials in high alert and highlight the significant impact of ZIKV on human health. New technologies to study the biology of ZIKV and to develop more effective prevention options are highly desired. in this study we demonstrate that direct delivery in mice of an infectious ZiKV cDnA clone allows the rescue of recombinant (r)ZiKV in vivo. A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the sequence of ZIKV strain Paraiba/2015 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was complexed with a commercial transfection reagent and administrated using different routes in type-I interferon receptor deficient A129 mice. Clinical signs and death associated with ZIKV viremia were observed in mice. the rZiKV recovered from these mice remained fully virulent in a second passage in mice. interestingly, infectious rZiKV was also recovered after intraperitoneal inoculation of the rZiKV cDnA in the absence of transfection reagent. further expanding these studies, we demonstrate that a single intraperitoneal inoculation of a cDnA clone encoding an attenuated rZiKV was safe, highly immunogenic, and provided full protection against lethal ZiKV challenge. this novel in vivo reverse genetics method is a potentially suitable delivery platform for the study of wild-type and liveattenuated ZiKV devoid of confounding factors typical associated with in vitro systems. Moreover, our results open the possibility of employing similar in vivo reverse genetic approaches for the generation of other viruses and, therefore, change the way we will use reverse genetics in the future. Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, became a global public concern because of the correlation of Zika virus epidemic with fetal developmental defects, including highly publicized cases of microcephaly 1 . The viral genome is made of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA molecule (~10.8 kb) that contains a single open reading frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions 2-4 . The viral RNA is translated as a single polyprotein that is co-and post-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases into three major structural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane and envelope) involved in viral entry, fusion and assembly 5 , and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) that are involved in viral RNA replication and transcription, assembly and evasion of the host antiviral responses [6] [7] [8] [9] . Although the majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic or associated with a mild febrile illness, infection during pregnancy has been associated with miscarriage and severe congenital malformations, including fetal
5ca4f6c8c69c8de8d3c1eda59bf1b4e963069359	The spike (S) protein of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) plays a central role in the pathogenicity, the immune antibody production, serotype and the tissue tropism. In this study, we generate 11 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against S1 subunit of IBV Sczy3 strain, and two mAbs 1D5 and 6A12 were positive in indirect ELISA against both His-S1 protein and the purified whole viral antigen. MAb 6A12 and 1D5 could recognized by other 10 IBV strains (IBVs) from five different genotypes, except that 1D5 had a relatively low reaction with two of the 10 tested IBVs. End-point neutralizing assay performed in chicken embro kidney (CEK) cells revealed that the neutralization titer of 6A12 and 1D5 against Sczy3 reached 1:44.7 and 1:40.6, respectively. After screening a phage display peptide library and peptide scanning, we identified two linear B-cell epitopes that were recognized by the mAbs 1D5 and 6A12, which corresponded to the amino acid sequences 87 PPQGMAW 93 and 412 IQTRTEP 418 , respectively, in the IBV S1 subunit. Sequences comparison revealed that epitope 412 IQTRTEP 418 was conserved among IBVs, while the epitope 87 PPQGMAW 93 was relatively variable among IBVs. The novel mAbs and the epitopes identified will be useful for developing diagnostic assays for IBV infections.
a8410d2ddc40a0f988442130e13ab8dad271467c	Aim The aims of this study were to examine the requests for influenza molecular tests processed by the Virology Laboratory of the University Hospital of Udine during the 2018-19 influenza season and to assess the test results and to estimate costs. Subjects and methods We analyzed various administrative databases of the hospital health information system, which can be deterministically linked at the individual level through an anonymous stochastic key. Requests for influenza molecular tests from November 1, 2018, to April 15, 2019, and test results were described by week and, for hospitalized patients, hospital ward. Previous vaccination status of tested patients, outcomes and estimated test costs were assessed. Results In the 2018-19 influenza season, 979 influenza A and B virologic tests were processed by the laboratory, corresponding to 758 patients. Requests had more than doubled compared with the previous influenza season. Rapid real-time PCR tests, routinely available at the University Hospital of Udine since January 2019, represented 17% of requests. Six hundred forty-eight patients were hospitalized. Medical wards requested the test after a median of 1 day after admission, whereas requests were delayed for surgical and oncologic patients. The number of tests, proportion of positivity and consumption of rapid tests varied by medical specialty. Overall consumption of oseltamivir was similar to that of the previous influenza season. Conclusions This analysis, benefiting from the availability of integrated health administrative databases, provided useful information to support public health decision-making and managing the supply and demand for diagnostic tests.
cae45f3de4ae72558a32d60227c91302ef532f0f	We report the results of a series of interventions implemented in online courses offered through the EdX (and openEdX) platform by Harvard University, Stanford University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Courses were selected based on their start dates in the period from September 2016 to June 2019. The implementation of interventions was constant across courses. The interventions were embedded in a course survey given to students at the beginning of the course, presented early in the courseware within the first page introduction (see Figure S1 ). Most courses already had a start-of-course survey with questions about demographics and prior experience. We standardized the content of this survey across institutions to better compare student characteristics across courses and institutions. The interventions were designed to be scalable so that every new course that launched during this period could participate by copying our survey intervention template. Adopting best practices from open science, we conducted our study in four pre-registered "waves" of implementation. In each wave, we pre-registered hypotheses and analytic code, collected data, conducted post-hoc investigations of heterogeneous treatment effects, and refined pre-registrations for the subsequent wave. All pre-registrations, analysis code, analytic output, and guidelines for requesting data from the host institutions are available online at https://osf.io/9bacu/. Our study plans were reviewed by the Committee on the Use of Human Subjects at Harvard (MIT ceded review to Harvard) and the Stanford Research Compliance Office.
e335d09a88c606503dae3cdfd7cf3602824786cb	This paper describes different aspects of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), presents visualization of the spread of the infection, and discusses the potential applications of data analytics on this viral infection. Firstly, a literature survey is done on COVID-19 highlighting a number of factors including its origin, its similarity with previous coronaviruses, its transmission capacity, its symptoms, etc. Secondly, data analytics is applied on a dataset of Johns Hopkins University to find out the spread of the viral infection. It is shown here that although the disease started in China in December 2019, the highest number of confirmed cases up to 04 June 2020 is in the USA. Thirdly, the worldwide increase in the number of confirmed cases over time is modelled here using a polynomial regression algorithm with degree 2. Fourthly, classification algorithms are applied on a dataset of 5644 samples provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein of Brazil in order to diagnose COVID-19. It is shown here that multilayer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost and logistic regression can classify COVID-19 patients at an accuracy above 91 percent. Finally, a discussion is presented on the potential applications of data analytics in several important factors of COVID-19.
d5dd082423cb4059dbc83ca0862918022e4a9f9f	Airflow and ventilation are particularly important in healthcare rooms for controlling thermohygrometric conditions, providing anaesthetic gas removal, diluting airborne bacterial contamination and minimizing bacteria transfer airborne. An actual hospitalization room was the investigate case study. Transient simulations with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), based on the finite element method (FEM) were performed to investigate the efficiency of the existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) plant with a variable air volume (VAV) primary air system. Solid modelling of the room, taking into account thermo-physical properties of building materials, architectural features (e.g., window and wall orientation) and furnishing (e.g., beds, tables and lamps) arrangement of the room, inlet turbulence high induction air diffuser, the return air diffusers and two patients lying on two parallel beds was carried out. Multiphysics modelling was used: a thermo-fluidynamic model (convection-conduction and incompressible Navier-Stokes) was combined with a convectiondiffusion model. Three 3D models were elaborated considering different conditions/events of the patients (i.e., the first was considered coughing and/or the second breathing). A particle tracing and diffusion model, connected to cough events, was developed to simulate the dispersal of bacteria-carrying droplets in the isolation room equipped with the existing ventilation system. An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of bacteria diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was performed. The analysis of transient simulation results concerning particle path and distance, and then particle tracing combined with their concentration, provided evidence of the formation of zones that should be checked by microclimatic and contaminant control. The present study highlights the fact that the CFD-FEM application is useful for understanding the efficiency, adequacy and reliability of the ventilation system, but also provides important suggestions for controlling air quality, patients' comfort and energy consumption in a hospital.

7149b8b4c8a338d95a56a676b3916da200eddc7c	In the past, toroviruses, a subfamily of the order Nidovirales, were mainly known to cause 64 enteric disease in mammals (1) (2)(3)(4). Recent studies linked nidovirus infections to respiratory 65 disease in cattle, pythons, and lizards, thus establishing nidoviruses as respiratory pathogens (5-66 12). In pythons, nidoviruses were found to be associated with chronic proliferative pneumonia 67 (5, 6, 10, 11), and the association was confirmed by experimental infection studies (7). Severe 68 cases exhibit typical pathological changes both after experimental and natural infection; these 69 include stomatitis, rhinitis, tracheitis, and pneumonia with significant mucus accumulation. 70 Taxonomically, python nidoviruses have recently been reclassified into the family 71 Tobaniviridae, subfamily Serpentovirinae, genus Pregotovirus (International Committee on 72 Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), https://talk.ictvonline.org (July 2018)). 73 A recent study identified yet another new novel nidovirus (genus Barnivirus) in Bellinger River 74 snapping turtles (Myuchelys georgesi). The infection was associated with necrotizing cystitis, 75 nephritis, adenitis and vasculitis, and the presence of viral RNA in many tissues, indicating 76 systemic spread of the virus (12). The target cell spectrum of python nidoviruses includes the 77 epithelium of the respiratory tract and lungs (6), and in some cases also the oral cavity and the 78 cranial esophagus (5-7, 11), the mucosa of which exhibits ciliated epithelium in snakes (13). Thus far little is known about the intra-and interspecies transmission of python nidoviruses. However, recent studies demonstrated nidovirus RNA in oral and cloacal swabs and the 81 intestinal content of diseased and healthy snakes, suggesting that both airborne and fecal-oral 82 transmission may occur (7, 14,(9)(10) (11) . In an earlier report, we studied the pathogenesis of nidovirus-associated pneumonia in green tree 84 pythons (6). Similarly to other investigators who described nidovirus pneumonia in pythons (5, 85 8, 10, 11), we occasionally detected the virus also in other organs, with and without evidence of 86 pathological changes (6), suggesting that the cell tropism of python nidoviruses goes beyond the 87 100 101 MATERIALS AND METHODS 102 Animals. The study included 30 pythons of six different species (green tree python, Morelia 103 viridis; woma python, Aspidites ramsayi; carpet python, Morelia spilota; Angolan python, 104 Python anchietae; ball python, Python regius; Indian python, Python molurus; Black-headed 105 python, Aspidites melanocephalus) with nidovirus-associated disease, confirmed by 106 immunohistology for nidovirus nucleoprotein (NP) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain 107 reaction (RT-PCR) (6) ( Table 1 ). The animals had been submitted for a diagnostic post mortem 108 examination upon the owners' request, either at the Institute of Veterinary Pathology,
d5fa1ff4d98c18a644d4ebdc49b61a5f1bec6024	34 Despite limited genomic diversity, SARS-CoV-2 has shown a wide range of clinical 35 manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences 36 are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral 37 load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA-sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal swabs from 430 38 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a 39 strong antiviral response with upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and 40 Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. 41 SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host 42 response. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) 43 demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of 44 ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression 45 of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while 46 transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with 47 lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and 48 their cognate receptor, CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in 49 trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, 50 males had reduced B and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of NF-kB 51 signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data 52 demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time 53 course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity. 54 55
418d9334932cd1b03e23fd6e03c01e660fff4bd4	Several important viruses including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the SARSassociated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) employ programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) for their protein expression. Here, a kinetic framework is developed to describe À1 PRF. The model reveals three kinetic pathways to À1 PRF that yield two possible frameshift products: those incorporating zero frame encoded A-site tRNAs in the recoding site, and products incorporating À1 frame encoded A-site tRNAs. Using known kinetic rate constants, the individual contributions of different steps of the translation elongation cycle to À1 PRF and the ratio between two types of frameshift products were evaluated. A dual fluorescence reporter was employed in Escherichia coli to empirically test the model. Additionally, the study applied a novel mass spectrometry approach to quantify the ratios of the two frameshift products. A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying À1 PRF may provide insight into developing antiviral therapeutics.
5a03dab9c611fbf0b647694cad0bb1b292fe7ce6	Innate immunity is a crucial defense system against viral and bacterial pathogens, providing a rapid response to mitigate the effects of microbial attack. While more readily associated with respiration and metabolism, recent research has surprisingly identified a number of mitochondrial factors in the mammalian innate immune system. This review summarizes the novel mitochondrial proteins, such as MAVS and NLRX1, involved in this process and attempts to reconcile this new mitochondrial function with our previous knowledge of the organelle.
06d6e97b4cad0f3e589cb296e81234b9b09b10d9	Image segmentation approaches typically incorporate weak regularity conditions such as boundary length or curvature terms, or use shape information. High-level information such as a desired area or volume, or a particular topology are only implicitly specified. In this paper we develop a segmentation method with explicit bounds on the segmented area. Area constraints allow for the soft selection of meaningful solutions, and can counteract the shrinking bias of length-based regularization. We analyze the intrinsic problems of convex relaxations proposed in the literature for segmentation with size constraints. Hence, we formulate the area-constrained segmentation task as a mixed integer program, propose a branch and bound method for exact minimization, and use convex relaxations to obtain the required lower energy bounds on candidate solutions. We also provide a numerical scheme to solve the convex subproblems. We demonstrate the method for segmentations of vesicles from electron tomography images.
471f86c0aa831b75726b025e0b54d623fc1b8479	High-throughput sequencing (HTS) enables most pathogens in a clinical sample to be detected from a single analysis, thereby providing novel opportunities for diagnosis, surveillance, and epidemiology. However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (twenty-two nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labeled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for eightynine clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method. DisCVR detected human viruses with high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (100%), and was able to detect mixed infections. Moreover, it produced results comparable to those in a published metagenomic analysis of 177 blood samples from patients in Nigeria. DisCVR has been designed as a user-friendly tool for detecting human viruses from HTS data using computers with limited RAM and processing power, and includes a graphical user interface to help users interpret and validate the output. It is written in Java and is publicly available from http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/discvr.php.
8d0520584219cdadb30b9bcf1b8afaffcd48d61c	The therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) started with interferon (IFN) monotherapy in the early 1990s and this therapy was considered effective in about 10% of cases. The present standard therapy of pegylated IFN with ribavirin achieves a sustained virologic response in about 50% of patients. However, about half of the CH-C patients are still at risk of fatal liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The other significant event in hepatitis C virus (HCV) research has been the development of a cell culture system. The subgenomic replicon system enables robust HCV RNA replication in hepatoma cells. And recently, the complete life cycle of HCV has been achieved using a genotype 2a strain, JFH1. These hallmarks have provided much information about the mechanisms of HCV replication, including information on the host molecules required for the replication. Anti-HCV reagents targeting HCV proteins have been developed, and some of them are now in clinical trials. However, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase frequently causes mutations in the HCV genome, which lead to the emergence of drug-resistant HCV mutants. Some of the cellular proteins essential for HCV RNA replication have already been discovered using the HCV cell culture system. These host molecules are also candidate targets for antivirals. Here, we describe the recent progress regarding the anti-HCV reagents targeting host metabolism.
677e721c74f2f5903acfc1373e01f889945e05ec	Objectives To investigate an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to identify the etiology, describe illness risk factors, and develop control measures. Study design A retrospective case-control study was performed including newborns with NEC and newborns without NEC, examining demographic factors and exposures to medications, staff members, and procedures before illness. Stool samples from affected newborns were collected and tested for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. We confirmed a NEC outbreak in the NICU in January 1998 with 8 cases, including 2 deaths, clustered in time and space. Norovirus-like particles were identified in all available stools from cases; norovirus (NoV) was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 4 of 6 samples. NEC cases were younger, had lower Apgar scores, and received antibiotics longer than 25 control subjects. Three NICU health care personnel had more contact with cases than control subjects; 1 staff member recalled having gastroenteritis symptoms around the time of the outbreak. Conclusions This report associates NoV with NEC. NoV appeared to precipitate NEC in predisposed infants. Spatial clustering and epidemiologic links between cases and a health care worker with gastroenteritis suggests that NoV should be investigated among the etiologies of NEC outbreaks and that interventions targeted to interruption of NoV transmission should be considered.

b32b26b8d44120d0daaa6fa57f5fd73234085837	Extracts of Echinacea purpurea (EP, purple coneflower) have been used traditionally in North America for the treatment of various types of infections and wounds, and they have become very popular herbal medicines globally. Recent studies have revealed that certain standardized preparations contain potent and selective antiviral and antimicrobial activities. In addition, they display multiple immune-modulatory activities, comprising stimulation of certain immune functions such as phagocytic activity of macrophages and suppression of the proinflammatory responses of epithelial cells to viruses and bacteria, which are manifested as alterations in secretion of various cytokines and chemokines. These immune modulations result from upregulation or downregulation of the relevant genes and their transcription factors. All these bioactivities can be demonstrated at noncytotoxic concentrations of extract and appear to be due to multiple components rather than the individual chemical compounds that characterize Echinacea extracts. Potential applications of the bioactive extracts may go beyond their traditional uses. Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology Table 1: Traditional uses of Echinacea (Coneflower) extracts.
5379e3a2ed26c6dea0c5c8c831775bc74636c454	Critical weather applications such as cyclone tracking require online visualization simultaneously performed with the simulations so that the scientists can provide real-time guidance to decision makers. However, resource constraints such as slow networks can hinder online remote visualization. In this work, we have developed an adaptive framework for efficient online remote visualization of critical weather applications. We present three algorithms, namely, most-recent, auto-clustering and adaptive, for reducing lag between the simulation and visualization times. Using experiments with different network configurations, we find that the adaptive algorithm strikes a good balance in providing reduced lags and visualizing most representative frames, with up to 72% smaller lag than auto-clustering, and 37% more representative than most-recent for slow networks.

b8eef746d8aad7f9e970f9f068e1c7738853ad3a	Enterovirus 71 (EV 71) is a causative agent of mild Hand Foot and Mouth Disease but is capable of causing severe complications in the CNS in young children. Reverse genetics technology is currently widely used to study the pathogenesis of the virus. The aim of this work was to determine and evaluate the factors which can contribute to infectivity of EV 71 RNA transcripts in vitro. Two strategies, overlapping RT-PCR and long distance RT-PCR, were employed to obtain the full-length genome cDNA clones of the virus. The length of the poly(A) tail and the presence of non-viral 3 -terminal sequences were studied in regard to their effects on infectivity of the in vitro RNA transcripts of EV 71 in cell culture. The data revealed that only cDNA clones obtained after long distance RT-PCR were infectious. No differences were observed in virus titres after transfection with in vitro RNA harbouring a poly(A) tail of 18 or 30 adenines in length, irrespective of the non-viral sequences at the 3 -terminus.
bfa037762989f3b93d63f94f17fe2d73339cc25f	Understanding respiratory pathogen transmission is essential for public health measures aimed at reducing pathogen spread. Particle generation and size are key determinant for pathogen carriage, aerosolisation, and transmission. Production of infectious respiratory particles is dependent on the type and frequency of respiratory activity, type and site of infection and pathogen load. Further, relative humidity, particle aggregation and mucus properties influence expelled particle size and subsequent transmission. Review of 26 studies reporting particle sizes generated from breathing, coughing, sneezing and talking showed healthy individuals generate particles between 0.01 and 500 mm, and individuals with infections produce particles between 0.05 and 500 mm. This indicates that expelled particles carrying pathogens do not exclusively disperse by airborne or droplet transmission but avail of both methods simultaneously and current dichotomous infection control precautions should be updated to include measures to contain both modes of aerosolised transmission.
5f45e2e283d5ed3b5a842d67bac964bf8a62d851	Infectious diseases are a major global concern and despite major advancements in medical research, still cause significant morbidity and mortality. Progress in antiviral therapy is particularly hindered by appearance of mutants capable of overcoming the effects of drugs targeting viral components. Alternatively, development of drugs targeting host proteins essential for completion of viral lifecycle holds potential as a viable strategy for antiviral therapy. Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways in particular are involved in several pathological conditions including cancer and viral infections, where hijacking or alteration of function of key transporter proteins, such as Chromosome Region Maintenance1 (CRM1) is observed. Overexpression of CRM1-mediated nuclear export is evident in several solid and hematological malignancies. Interestingly, CRM1-mediated nuclear export of viral components is crucial in various stages of the viral lifecycle and assembly. This review summarizes the role of CRM1 in cancer and selected viruses. Leptomycin B (LMB) is the prototypical inhibitor of CRM1 potent against various cancer cell lines overexpressing CRM1 and in limiting viral infections at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. However, the irreversible shutdown of nuclear export results in high cytotoxicity and limited efficacy in vivo. This has prompted search for synthetic and natural CRM1 inhibitors that can potentially be developed as broadly active antivirals, some of which are summarized in this review.

2508873868782ebdc77194b384991659cfad921a	In this article, we present a case of a young female patient with previously diagnosed lupus pneumonitis, now with a flare and new superimposed COVID-19 infection that was treated with intravenous steroids. On computed tomography scans, she had extensive interstitial lung fibrosis in addition to a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test requiring 6 L of oxygen via nasal cannula on admission. After administration of methylprednisolone, the patient improved and was weaned off her oxygen requirements and was discharged home.
41adf2b70da9ddde294ae8af62d44c213d0cb18e	Low cost embedded devices with computational power have the potential to revolutionise detection and management of many diseases. This is especially true in the case of conditions like sleep apnea, which require continuous long term monitoring. In this paper, we give details of a portable, cost-effective and customisable Electrocardiograph(ECG) Signal analyser for real time sleep apnea detection. We have developed a data analysis pipeline using which we can identify sleep apnea using a single lead ECG signal. Our method combines steps including dataset extraction, segmentation, signal cleaning, filtration and finally apnea detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We analysed our proposed implementation through a complete run on the MIT-Physionet dataset. Due to the low computational complexity of our proposed method, we find that it is well suited for deployment on embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

1b2079db92924c2ee758d437394789b4822d0327	Intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) is widely used for hemodynamic support in critical patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). We examined whether the in-hospital mortality of patients in Taiwan treated with IABP has recently declined. We used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to retrospectively review the in-hospital all-cause mortality of 9952 (7146 men [71.8%]) 18-year-old and older patients treated with IABP between 1998 and 2008. The mortality rate was 13.84% (n = 1377). The urbanization levels of the hospitals, and the number of days in the intensive care unit, of hospitalization, and of IABP treatment, and prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were associated with mortality. Seven thousand six hundred thirty-five patients (76.72%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, and 576 (5.79%) underwent high-risk PCI with IABP treatment. The number of patients treated with IABP significantly increased during this decade (p trend < 0.0001), the in-hospital all-cause mortality for patients treated with IABP significantly decreased (p trend = 0.0243), but the in-hospital all-cause mortality of patients who underwent CABG and PCI plus IABP did not decrease. In conclusion, the in-hospital mortality rate of IABP treatment decreased annually in Taiwan during the study period. However, high-risk patients who underwent coronary revascularization with IABP had a higher and unstable in-hospital mortality rate.
fac2859eaaea814ddabb2999b344ba9a470c186c	The spike (S) protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design. In the present study, three fragments of the truncated S protein were expressed in E. coli, and analyzed with pooled sera of convalescence phase of SARS patients. The full length S gene DNA vaccine was constructed and used to immunize BALB/c mice. The mouse serum IgG antibody against SARS-CoV was measured by ELISA with E. coli expressed truncated S protein or SARS-CoV lysate as diagnostic antigen. The results showed that all the three fragments of S protein expressed by E. coli was able to react with sera of SARS patients and the S gene DNA candidate vaccine could induce the production of specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV efficiently in mice with seroconversion ratio of 75% after 3 times of immunization. These findings lay some foundations for further understanding the immunology of SARS-CoV and developing SARS vaccines.

During the past 10 years, advances in this field allowed to achieve more and more sophisticated CyDs derivatives opening a simple access in scale-up quantities to original and better CyD-based gene delivery systems. In addition, possibility to combine covalent and supramolecular approaches offers new venues for the design of tailor-made CyDbased nanovehicles to improve their transfection ability and gene transfer in cells. In this account, we describe our recent progress in the construction of a novel CyD-based G0 (generation number) core dendrimer, scalable to CyD oligomers by a strategy using protonable guanidine tethers and whose concept can be generalized for the assembly of CyD pre-coated dendrimers. The synthetic strategy based on an original Staudinger-Aza-Wittig tandem coupling reaction. We present an outline of the different analytical strategies to characterize CyD-ODN (cyclodextrin-oligodeoxynucleotide) complexes. Among them, Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to perfectly characterize our CyD-siRNA and CyD-DNA complexes and shown to be a very attractive method with advantages of low sample consumption, rapid analysis speed, and high efficiency that make this technology a major tool for association constant measurement. Finally, we present the different biological methods that can be used, in vitro, to study gene delivery, and more precisely ones we have performed to evaluate the capability of our original model bis-guanidinium-tetrakis-␤-cyclodextrin dendrimeric tetrapod, to deliver efficiently DNA or siRNA in eukaryotic cells.
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	Streaming APIs allow for big data processing of native data structures by providing MapReduce-like operations over these structures. However, unlike traditional big data systems, these data structures typically reside in shared memory accessed by multiple cores. Although popular, this emerging hybrid paradigm opens the door to possibly detrimental behavior, such as thread contention and bugs related to non-execution and non-determinism. This study explores the use and misuse of a popular streaming API, namely, Java 8 Streams. The focus is on how developers decide whether or not to run these operations sequentially or in parallel and bugs both specific and tangential to this paradigm. Our study involved analyzing 34 Java projects and 5.53 million lines of code, along with 719 manually examined code patches. Various automated, including interprocedural static analysis, and manual methodologies were employed. The results indicate that streams are pervasive, parallelization is not widely used, and performance is a crosscutting concern that accounted for the majority of fixes. We also present coincidences that both confirm and contradict the results of related studies. The study advances our understanding of streams, as well as benefits practitioners, programming language and API designers, tool developers, and educators alike. Traditional big data systems, for which MapReduce is a popular backbone [3], minimize the complexity of writing massively distributed programs by facilitating processing on multiple nodes using succinct functional-like constructs. This makes writing parallel code easier, as writing such code can be difficult due to possible data races, thread interference, and contention [1, 4, 28] . The code above, e.g., can execute in parallel simply by replacing stream() with parallelStream(). However, unlike traditional big data systems, data structures processed by streaming APIs like Java 8 Streams typically reside in shared memory accessed by multiple cores. Therefore, issues may arise from the close intimacy between shared memory and the operations being performed, especially for developers not previously familiar with functional programming. Streams are not just an API but rather an emerging, hybrid paradigm. To obtain the expressiveness, speed, and parallelism that streams have to offer, developers must adopt the paradigm as well as the API [6, Ch. 7]. This requires determining whether running stream code in parallel yields an efficient yet interference-free program [24] and ensuring that no operations on different threads interleave [42]. Despite the benefits [53, Ch. 1], misusing streams may result in detrimental behavior, and the ∼4K questions related to streams on Stack Overflow [48], of which ∼5% remain unanswered, suggest that there is ample confusion surrounding the topic. Bugs related to thread contention (due to λ-expressions, i.e., units of computation, side-effects, buffering), non-execution (due to deferred execution), non-determinism (due to non-deterministic operations), operation sequencing (ordering of stream operations), and data ordering (ordering of stream data) can lead to programs that undermine concurrency, underperform, are incorrect, and are inefficient. Worse yet, these problems may increase over time as streams rise in popularity, with Mazinanian et al. [32] finding a two-fold increasing trend in the adoption of λ-expressions, an essential part of streams. This study explores the use and misuse of a popular and representative streaming API, namely, Java 8 Streams. We set out to understand the usage and bug patterns involving streams in real software. Particularly, we are interested in discovering (i) how developers decide whether to run streams sequentially or in parallel, (ii) common stream operations, (iii) common stream attributes and whether they are amenable to safe and efficient parallelization, (iv) bugs both specific and tangential to streams, (v) how often incorrect stream APIs were used, and (vi) how often stream APIs were misused and in which ways? Knowing the kinds of bugs typically associated with streams can, e.g., help improve (automated) bug detection. Being aware of the typical usage patterns of streams can, e.g., improve code completion in IDEs. In general, the results (i) advance our understanding of this emerging hybrid paradigm, (ii) provide feedback to language and API designers for future API versions, (iii) help tool designers comprehend the struggles developers have with streams, (iv) propose preliminary best practices and anti-patterns for practitioners to use streaming APIs effectively, (v) and assist educators in teaching streaming APIs. We analyzed 34 Java projects and 5.53 million lines of source code (SLOC), along with 140,446 code patches (git commits), of which 719 were manually 1 Collection<Widget> unorderedWidgets = new HashSet<>(); // populate ... 2 Collection<Widget> orderedWidgets = new ArrayList<>(); // populate ... 3 List<Widget> sortedWidgets = unorderedWidgets.stream() 4 .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Widget::getWeight)).collect(Collectors.toList()); 5 // collect weights over 43.2 into a set in parallel. 6 Set<Double> heavyWidgetWeightSet = orderedWidgets.parallelStream().map(Widget::getWeight) 7 .filter(w -> w > 43.2).collect(Collectors.toSet()); 8 // sequentially collect into a list, skipping first 1000.

7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	Coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease with first symptoms similar to the flu. COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly spreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets, deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easyto-apply health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of COVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models retained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.
7cf2d394e5b60d11cd8c7abe1f4416ec884f0ab1	As of July 14 th , COVID-19 has caused in Italy 34.984 deaths and 243.344 infection cases. Strict lockdown policies were necessary to contain the first outbreak wave and prevent the Italian healthcare system from being overwhelmed by patients requiring intensive care. After the progressive reopening, predicting how the epidemic situation will evolve is urgent and fundamental to control any future outbreak and prevent a second wave. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to repeatedly calibrate the SIDARTHE model 1 with data up to June 24 th . The computed parameter distributions allow us to robustly analyse how the epidemic situation evolved and outline possible future scenarios. Assuming a seasonal regime for COVID-19, we tested different lockdown policies. Our results suggest that an intermittent lockdown where six "open days" are allowed every other week may prevent a resurgent exponential outbreak and, at the same time, ease the societal burden of an extensive lockdown.
03342c6c4dc00715c4fe0cce51b6df10f8b99c81	Relational mobility is a socio-ecological construct quantifying how much freedom and opportunity a society affords individuals to choose and dispose of interpersonal relationships. Past research has confirmed that relational mobility varies across nations, but no largescale study has examined the degree to which relational mobility may vary within a single nation. We report two studies (Study 1, N = 647; Study 2, N = 7343) exploring within-country similarity or variability in relational mobility across all 27 states and five geo-socio-political regions in the continent-size country of Brazil. Results confirmed the measurement equivalence of the Relational Mobility Scale across respondents from all Brazilian states. Notably, relational mobility scores were uniform across Brazilian regions and states, indicating a common national culture regarding the amount of opportunities Brazilians have in selecting new relationship partners within their social context. Replicating existing findings, relational mobility was positively associated with pro-active tendencies that help people retain relationships-levels of intimacy and self-disclosure toward a close friend-indicating that friends tend to feel closer intimacy to their close friends, and reveal serious personal information to a larger degree in social contexts where opportunities to find and retain relationships with like-minded others are greater.

1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	Distress propagation occurs in connected networks, its rate and extent being dependent on network topology. To study this, we choose economic production networks as a paradigm. An economic network can be examined at many levels-linkages among individual agents (microscopic), among firms/sectors (mesoscopic) or among countries (macroscopic). New emergent dynamical properties appear at every level, so the granularity matters. For viral epidemics, even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and potentially affect the entire network. Economic networks, however, are known to be immune at the micro-levels and more prone to failure in the meso/macro-levels. We propose a dynamical interaction model to characterize the mechanism of distress propagation, across different modules of a network, initiated at different epicenters. Vulnerable modules often lead to large degrees of destabilization. We demonstrate our methodology using a unique empirical data-set of input-output linkages across 0.14 million firms in one administrative state of India, a developing economy. The network has multiple hub-and-spoke structures that exhibits moderate disassortativity, which varies with the level of coarse-graining. The novelty lies in characterizing the production network at different levels of granularity or modularity, and finding 'too-big-to-fail' modules supersede 'too-central-to-fail' modules in distress propagation.
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	Background: Surfaces in congregate settings, such as vehicles used for mass transportation, can become contaminated with infectious microorganisms and facilitate disease transmission. We disinfected surfaces contaminated with H1N1 influenza viruses using hydrogen peroxide (HP) vapor at concentrations below 100 ppm and triethylene glycol (TEG)-saturated air containing 2 ppm of TEG at 258C. MethodsInfluenza viruses in aqueous suspensions were deposited on stainless-steel coupons, allowed to dry at ambient conditions, and then exposed for up to 15 minutes to 10 to 90 ppm of HP vapor or TEG-saturated air. Virus assays were done on the solution used to wash the viruses from these coupons and from coupons treated similarly but without exposure to HP or TEG vapor. Results: After 2.5 minutes, exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor resulted in 99% inactivation. For air saturated with TEG at 25 to 298C, the disinfection rate was about 1.3 log 10 reductions per hour, about 16 times faster than the measured natural inactivation rate under ambient conditions. Conclusions: Vapor concentrations of 10 ppm HP or 2 ppm TEG can provide effective surface disinfection. At these low concentrations, the potential for damage to even the avionics of an airplane would be expected to be minimal. At a TEG vapor concentration of 2 ppm, there are essentially no health risks to people.
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an economically devastating enteric disease in the swine industry. The virus infects pigs of all ages, but it cause severe clinical disease in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100% mortality. Currently, available vaccines are not completely effective and feedback methods utilizing PEDV infected material has variable success in preventing reinfection. Comprehensive information on the levels and duration of effector/memory IgA and IgG antibody secreting B cell response in the intestines and lymphoid organs of PEDV-infected sows, and their association with specific antibody levels in clinical samples such as plasma, oral fluid, and feces is important. Therefore, our goal in this study was to quantify PEDV specific IgA and IgG B cell responses in sows at approximately 1 and 6 months post-infection in commercial swine herds, including parity one and higher sows. Our data indicated that evaluation of both PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid (but not feces) samples is beneficial in disease diagnosis. PEDV specific B cell response in the intestine and spleen of infected sows decline by 6 months, and this associates with specific antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid samples; but the virus neutralization titers in plasma remains high beyond 6 months post-infection. In conclusion, in sows infected with PEDV the presence of effector/memory B cell response and strong virus neutralization titers in plasma up to 6 months postinfection, suggests their potential to protect sows from reinfection and provide maternal immunity to neonates, but challenge studies are required to confirm such responses. © 2015 Ouyang et al.

2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	Infectious or contagious diseases can be transmitted from one person to another through social contact networks. In today's interconnected global society, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the network transmission of contagious diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and demonstrate their empirical superiority.
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	Work with highly pathogenic material mandates the use of biological containment facilities, involving microbiological safety cabinets and specialist laboratory engineering structures typified by containment level 3 (CL3) and CL4 laboratories. Consequences of working in high containment are the practical difficulties associated with containing specialist assays and equipment often essential for experimental analyses. In an era of increased interest in biodefence pathogens and emerging diseases, immunological analysis has developed rapidly alongside traditional techniques in virology and molecular biology. For example, in order to maximise the use of small sample volumes, multiplexing has become a more popular and widespread approach to quantify multiple analytes simultaneously, such as cytokines and chemokines. The luminex microsphere system allows for the detection of many cytokines and chemokines in a single sample, but the detection method of using aligned lasers and fluidics means that samples often have to be analysed in low containment facilities. In order to perform cytokine analysis in materials from high containment (CL3 and CL4 laboratories), we have developed an appropriate inactivation methodology after staining steps, which although results in a reduction of median fluorescent intensity, produces statistically comparable outcomes when judged against non-inactivated samples. This methodology thus extends the use of luminex technology for material that contains highly pathogenic biological agents.
00542c115a9aebacf8024b2e21c5f124b7bbf620	Background: Human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) has been isolated from children with respiratory tract infections and its prevalence in Korea has not been reported. Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the presence and the clinical features of HCoV-NL63 during two winter seasons. Study design: During
3d9b12f988b9c3311cbdf8a19c56ce343d91d210	Background: The sepsis-induced immunodepression contributes to impaired clinical outcomes of various stress conditions. This syndrome is well documented and characterized by attenuated function of innate and adaptive immune cells. Several pharmacological interventions aimed to restore the immune response are emerging of which interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is one. It is of paramount relevance to obtain clinical information on optimal timing of the IFNγ-treatment, −tolerance, −effectiveness and outcome before performing a RCT. We describe the effects of IFNγ in a cohort of 18 adult and 2 pediatric sepsis patients. In this open-label prospective multi-center case-series, IFNγ treatment was initiated in patients selected on clinical and immunological criteria early (< 4 days) or late (> 7 days) following the onset of sepsis. The data collected in 18 adults and 2 liver transplanted pediatric patients were: clinical scores, monocyte expression of HLA-DR (flow cytometry), lymphocyte immune-phenotyping (flow cytometry), IL-6 and IL-10 plasma levels (ELISA), bacterial cultures, disease severity, and mortality. Results: In 15 out of 18 patients IFNγ treatment was associated with an increase of median HLA-DR expression from 2666 [IQ 1547; 4991] to 12,451 [IQ 4166; 19,707], while the absolute number of lymphocyte subpopulations were not affected, except for the decrease number of NK cells 94.5 [23; 136] to 32.5 [13; 90.8] (0.0625)]. Plasma levels of to 108 (89-140) ng/mL (p = 0.04) and IL-10 from IL-10 from 29 [12-59] to 9 [1-15] pg/mL decreased significantly. Three patients who received IFNγ early after ICU admission (<4 days) died. The other patients had a rapid clinical improvement assessed by the SOFA score and bacterial cultures that were repeatedly positive became negative. The 2 pediatric cases improved rapidly, but 1 died for hemorrhagic complication. Conclusion: Guided by clinical and immunological monitoring, adjunctive immunotherapy with IFNγ appears welltolerated in our cases and improves immune host defense in sepsis induced immuno suppression. Randomized clinical studies to assess its potential clinical benefit are warranted.
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	and young children, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for viral pathogenesis have not been fully elucidated. To date, no drugs or vaccines have been employed to improve clinical outcomes for RSV-infected patients. In this paper, we report that angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protected against severe lung injury induced by RSV infection in an experimental mouse model and in pediatric patients. Moreover, ACE2 deficiency aggravated RSV-associated disease pathogenesis, mainly by its action on the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Furthermore, administration of a recombinant ACE2 protein alleviated the severity of RSV-induced lung injury. These findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in preventing RSV-induced lung injury, and suggest that ACE2 is a promising potential therapeutic target in the management of RSV-induced lung disease. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family. RSV is the most common virus responsible for acute and severe lower airway diseases in infants and young children, with nearly all children experiencing at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years 1 . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 34 million new pediatric cases of RSV-associated lower airway disease occur annually worldwide; most cases occur in developing countries, with a mortality rate of nearly 200,000 annually 2,3 . Despite the significant impact of RSV infection on infant morbidity and mortality, treatment options remain largely limited to supportive care 4 . Currently, Ribavirin is the only antiviral drug that has been approved for treatment of RSV-infected airway diseases, although issues with its efficacy and side effects restrict its application in immunocompromised patients 5 . The high incidence of RSV infection and its potential to cause severe respiratory tract disease in vulnerable young children, combined with the limited availability of therapeutic options, highlight an urgent unmet global human health need. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in maintaining blood pressure, and electrolyte and fluid homeostasis 6-8 . In 2000, ACE2, a homolog of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene was reported to negatively regulate RAS by converting angiotensin (Ang)-II to Ang-1-7 9 . Previous studies, from our group and others, have demonstrated that ACE2 protects against severe acute lung injury (ALI) that can be triggered by sepsis, acid aspiration, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the lethal avian influenza A H5N1 virus 10-12 . Moreover, ACE2 has been identified as the receptor of the SARS coronavirus 11 , and has also been found to modulate innate immunity and influence the composition of gut microbiota 13 . More importantly, a recombinant ACE2 protein has proven to be effective in improving lung pathologies associated with ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by viruses including SARS and influenza 12, 14, 15 . Currently, a soluble version of recombinant ACE2 is being tested in phase II clinical trials for patients with ALI 14 .
87e8813c6e090fd06ddf7883f08ce908690a62a8	Objective Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) increases hospital stay, resource utilization, morbidity, and mortality. However, there is paucity of data about its effect in Indian patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods Seven hundred forty-eight patients underwent off-pump CABG from January 2015 to December 2016 (24 months). One hundred twenty-seven patients (16.7%) developed POAF. In an effort to mitigate the effects of wider risk factors on perioperative outcomes, a separate sub-analysis of patients based on risks quantified by EuroSCORE II (<> 3) was also performed. Results Age > 60 years and development of sepsis were the independent predictors for the development of POAF. Thirty-day/ mortality rate was higher in the POAF group (7.1% vs. 1.4%; p value < 0.001). POAF was associated with increased ICU and hospital stay and increased incidence of stroke and renal dysfunction. The survival was significantly lower in the POAF group compared with the normal sinus rhythm (NSR) (3-year survival in POAF was 81.3% vs. 94.4% in the NSR group; Hazard ratio (HR) 3.867 (1.989-7.516)). Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) usage, age ≥ 60 years and sepsis were independent predictors for the development of POAF in low-risk patients. For the NSR group, 1-year survival was 98% and 3-year survival was 95.7%. For the POAF group, 1-year survival was 94.4% and 3-year survival was 84.0% (HR. 3.794 (1.897-7.591)). Conclusion The incidence of POAF was lower than reported in the wider global literature. Increasing age and development of post-operative sepsis were strong independent predictors of POAF. POAF increases the morbidity; length of hospital stay and these patients show decreased survival after off-pump CABG.
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	The capacity of current molecular testing convention does not allow high-throughput and community level scans of COVID-19 infections. The diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.
d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	Background: Coronavirus membrane (M) proteins are capable of interacting with nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E) proteins. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M co-expression with either N or E is sufficient for producing virus-like particles (VLPs), although at a lower level compared to M, N and E co-expression. Whether E can release from cells or E/N interaction exists so as to contribute to enhanced VLP production is unknown. It also remains to be determined whether E palmitoylation or disulfide bond formation plays a role in SARS-CoV virus assembly. Results: SARS-CoV N is released from cells through an association with E protein-containing vesicles. Further analysis suggests that domains involved in E/N interaction are largely located in both carboxyl-terminal regions. Changing all three E cysteine residues to alanines did not exert negative effects on E release, E association with N, or E enhancement of VLP production, suggesting that E palmitoylation modification or disulfide bond formation is not required for SARS-CoV virus assembly. We found that removal of the last E carboxyl-terminal residue markedly affected E release, N association, and VLP incorporation, but did not significantly compromise the contribution of E to efficient VLP production. The independence of the SARS-CoV E enhancement effect on VLP production from its viral packaging capacity suggests a distinct SARS-CoV E role in virus assembly.
439ddbbdb17f5ab18ac2e208e7df5c09a8dc9789	Background: Gastrointestinal symptoms, in particular diarrhoea, are common in non-treated HIV-1 infected individuals. Although various enteric pathogens have been implicated, the aetiology of diarrhoea remains unexplained in a large proportion of HIV-1 infected patients. Our aim is to identify the cause of diarrhoea for patients that remain negative in routine diagnostics. Methods: In this study stool samples of 196 HIV-1 infected persons, including 29 persons with diarrhoea, were examined for enteropathogens and HIV-1. A search for unknown and unexpected viruses was performed using virus discovery cDNA-AFLP combined with Roche-454 sequencing (VIDISCA-454).
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	Objectives: We examined 17 health information portals to determine the status of web-based health information services in the United States (USA), South Korea, the United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. Methods: We analyzed longitudinal trends in 35 items of online health information over four years among representative health information portals (eight based in the USA, seven in South Korea, one in the UK, and one in Australia), focusing on external portal structure, content scope, service characteristic, and service function with four stakeholder groups of six stakeholders. Results: The most notable change was in the service items, and overall, in 44.1% of total items: 17.6% in service characteristic, 41.2% in external portal structure, 58.8% in service function, and 58.8% in content scope change. More specifically, these changes included increases in the "mobile application utility" (service function), "use of personal health records" on public health portals (content scope change), "Charts and videos" (service characteristic), and "renewal date" (external portal structure). Conclusions: This review of existing health portals will be a footnote for enabling health care providers to confirm whether the needs of consumers are reflected on their website with high reliability. Furthermore, these findings will help to enhance the quality of portals by delivering relevant information to stakeholders and to the consumers of online health information.
e1c84a87e38ef141cd77c01104ae2aebff2842c4	When 2020 began, we had no idea what was to unfold globally as we learnt about the Novel-Coronavirus in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China. As this virus spread rapidly, it became a matter of time before many countries began to implement measures to try and contain the spread of the disease. COVID-19 as it is referred to, resulted in two main approaches to fighting the viral pandemic, either through a progressive set of measures to slow down the number of identified cases designed to 'flatten the curve' over time (anticipated to be at least six months), or to attack it by the severest of measures including a total lock-down and/or herding exposure to fast track 'immunisation' while we await a vaccine. The paper reports the findings from the first phase of an ongoing survey designed to identify the changing patterns in travel activity of Australian residents as a result of the stage 2 restrictions imposed by the Australian government. The main restrictions, in addition to social distancing of at least 1.5 metres, are closure of entry to Australia (except residents returning), and closure of non-essential venues such as night clubs, restaurants, mass attendee sporting events, churches, weddings, and all social gatherings in any circumstance. With some employers encouraging working from home and others requiring it, in addition to job losses, and many children attending school online from home, the implications on travel activity is extreme. We identify the initial impacts associated with the first month of stricter social distancing measures introduced in Australia.

2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	Cases were analysed for general characteristics, exposure source, timeline and infection generation. Sex, age and underlying diseases were analysed for the 38 deaths. Findings: Beginning with the index case that infected 28 others, an in-depth analysis was conducted. The average age was 55 years, which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years. As in most other countries, more men than women were affected. The case fatality rate was 19.9%, which was lower than the global rate of 38.7% and the rate in Saudi Arabia (36.5%). In total, 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no communityacquired infections. The main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases, cancer and hypertension. The main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis, quarantine failure of 'super spreaders', familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and 'doctor shopping'. The outbreak was entirely nosocomial, and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures, rather than biomedical factors.
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	Throughout the past six months, no number has dominated the public media more persistently than the reproduction number of COVID-19. This powerful but simple concept is widely used by the public media, scientists, and political decision makers to explain and justify political strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Europe. We propose a dynamic SEIR epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction number, which we identify using machine learning. During the early outbreak, the basic reproduction number was 4.22 ± 1.69, with maximum values of 6.33 and 5.88 in Germany and the Netherlands. By May 10, 2020, it dropped to 0.67 ± 0.18, with minimum values of 0.37 and 0.28 in Hungary and Slovakia. We found a strong correlation between passenger air travel, driving, walking, and transit mobility and the effective reproduction number with a time delay of 17.24 ± 2.00 days. Our new dynamic SEIR model provides the flexibility to simulate various outbreak control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify safe solutions in the benefit of global health.

150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	1 Background: The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) is a rapid 2 diagnostic tool for novel coronavirus disease 2019 infections. However, 3 with significant numbers of false negatives, improvements to GICA are needed. 4 Methods: Six recombinant HCoV-19 nucleocapsid and spike proteins were prepared 5 and evaluated. The optimal proteins were employed to develop a sandwich-format 6 GICA strip to detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG) against HCoV-19. GICA's 7 performance was assessed with comparison of viral RNA detection. 8 Results: Recombinant HCoV-19 proteins were obtained, including three 9 prokaryotically expressed rN, rN1, rN2 nucleocapsid proteins, and three 10 eukaryotically expressed rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc spike proteins. The recombinant 11 proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) against 12 coronavirus-specific IgM and IgG were chosen for GICA development. The GICA 13 has a sensitivity and specificity of 86.89% (106/122) and 99.39% (656/660), 14 respectively. Furthermore, 65.63% (21/32) of the clinically confirmed but RT-PCR 15 negative samples were GICA positive. 16 The eukaryotically-expressed spike proteins (rS1and rS-RBD-mFc) are 17 more suitable than the prokaryotically expressed nucleocapsid proteins for HCoV-19 18 serological diagnosis. The GICA sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a 19 powerful complement to the current standard RNA-based tests.
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	With new cases of Covid-19 surging in the United States, we need to better understand how the spread of novel coronavirus varies across all segments of the population. We use hierarchical exponential growth curve modeling techniques to examine whether community social and economic characteristics uniquely influence the incidence of Covid-19 cases in the urban built environment. We show that, as of May 3, 2020, confirmed coronavirus infections are concentrated along demographic and socioeconomic lines in New York City and surrounding areas, the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. Furthermore, we see evidence that, after the onset of the pandemic, timely enactment of physical distancing measures such as school closures is imperative in order to limit the extent of the coronavirus spread in the population. Public health authorities must impose nonpharmaceutical measures early on in the pandemic and consider community-level factors that associate with a greater risk of viral transmission.

083c334f893138f09bf9f62ee55e50328201f7fb	The spread of COVID-19 throughout Italy, particularly Lombardy, led to adopt quarantine measures, known to exacerbate pre-existing psychiatric conditions. We described a telephone-based surveillance on 101 euthymic Mood Disorder outpatients in Milan by a non-standardized survey to evaluate reactions to lockdown measures and the presence of quarantine stressors. Frustration was the most represented quarantine stressor. Being jobless was significantly related to the presence of frustration, somatization, increased alertness, psychic anxiety and low mood; younger age to the presence of psychic anxiety, alertness and financial concerns. No recurrences were observed at the time of writing.
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	The novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed several challenges for neuromuscular disorder (NMD) patients. The risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increased in all but the mildest forms of NMDs. High-risk conditions include reduced airway clearance due to oropharyngeal weakness and risk of worsening with fever, fasting or infection Isolation requirements may have an impact on treatment regimens administered in hospital settings, such as nusinersen, glucosidase alfa, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab infusions. In addition, specific drugs for SARS-CoV2 infection under investigation impair neuromuscular function significantly; chloroquine and azithromycin are not recommended in myasthenia gravis without available ventilatory support and prolonged prone positioning may influence options for treatment. Other therapeutics may affect specific NMDs (metabolic, mitochondrial, myotonic diseases) and experimental approaches for Coronavirus disease 2019 may be offered "compassionately" only after consulting the patient's NMD specialist. In parallel, the reorganization of hospital and outpatient services may change the management of non-infected NMD patients and their caregivers, favouring at-distance approaches. However, the literature on the validation of telehealth in this subgroup of patients is scant. Thus, as the first wave of the pandemic is progressing, clinicians and researchers should address these crucial open issues to ensure adequate caring for NMD patients. This manuscript summarizes available evidence so far and provides guidance for both general neurologists and NMD specialists dealing with NMD patients in the time of COVID-19.
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	The coronavirus disease belongs to the family Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties resulting in the death of immune-compromised patients. We performed a phylogenomic and phylogeographic tree from the collected datasets. Phylogenomic analysis or sequence-based phylogeny showed an evolutionary relationship between the geographical strains. The phylogenomic tree grouped into two major clades consists of various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 and Bat SARS-like coronavirus, Bat coronavirus, and Pangolin coronavirus. The phylogenetic neighbor of newly sequenced Indian strains (Accession: MT012098.1, MT050493.1) was revealed to identify the variations between the nCoV-19 strains. The results showed keen evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved from Bat SARS-like coronavirus. The evolutionary history and comparative proteomic analysis provide a new avenue for the current scientific research related to the coronavirus.
9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	The objective of this study was to compare the effect of non-GMO Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation products (SCFP) with that of a halofuginone treatment against Cryptosporidium parvum infection in pre-weaned calves on a commercial dairy farm. A total of 123 neonatal female calves, housed in individual hutches, were enrolled sequentially based on date of birth in 41 blocks of 3 animals each. Calves within each block were allocated to one of 3 treatments: remaining untreated, fed with SCFP (Diamond V SmartCare ® at 1 g/d in milk and NutriTek ® at 5 g/d in starter grain) for the first 63 days of life, or treated with halofuginone (0.1 mg/kg/d) for the first 7 days of life. Fecal samples collected on days 4-21 post-partum were examined for both Cryptosporidium oocysts and coproantigen. The presence and intensity of diarrhea were monitored by scoring daily for the first 4 weeks of life. Calves were weighed at 0, 21, 42 and 63 days of age. Almost all calves were Cryptosporidium-positive at least once during the study. Halofuginone significantly reduced the number of Cryptosporidium-positive fecal samples as compared to the two other groups. Based on the coproantigen scores, both halofuginone and SCFP feeding significantly reduced the intensity of Cryptosporidium infection as compared to the untreated group. Diarrhea was recorded in almost all calves at least once. Neither the proportion of diarrheic calves nor the intensity and duration of diarrhea differed among the 3 treatment groups significantly. The mean daily weight gain during the first 3 weeks of life was significantly lower in halofuginone treated calves than in both other groups; however, at the end of the study period the total weight gain did not significantly differ among the 3 treatment groups. In conclusion, the clinical results and weight gains of pre-weaning supplementation with the SCFP were neither better nor worse than the 7-day halofuginone treatment suggesting that the SCFP feeding may be from the clinical point of view a natural alternative measure, instead of halofuginone treatment, in bovine cryptosporidiosis.
fb8e2e76092de55f4b7f22bd0106f6c3853ca3bd	In the present study, a new hepatic tissue-origin cell line from European eel Anguilla anguilla has been developed and characterized. This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L-15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast-like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15-32°C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27°C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immunerelated molecules interferon regulatory factor-7 (irf7) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated. All four genes were significantly upregulated following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggested the application of EL cell line for viral identification, as well as for immunodiagnosis and pharmacological targeting.

In Post-COVID scenario, to restore the margins and regain the lost production, industries are likely to increase their production leading to a quantum jump in the pollution levels. Having precedence of such a scenario in 2008-09, this article looks at what are the possible avenues to engage the city government and business houses through an a new normal ECO-BCP concept for long term sustainability. All economic stimulus needs to be tied down with the stringent reduction in the emission norms. The Ten Principles for the Eco-centric BCP guide the reopening of MSMEs after lockdown period called to check the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Eco-centric BCP model will help the MSMEs to adopt the new-normal business strategies to align with the country-specific commitments to SDGs, SFDRR and Paris declaration.
27d47347e18de0e85c9de145ab9b4f95b11601a1	Aims: To analyse the lung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and correlate the findings with the time sequence of the disease. Methods and results: Ten patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS, and virological confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection were identified. Histology in most cases showed diffuse alveolar damage, from early to late phases, and the changes corresponded to the time sequence. Other variable features include multinucleated giant cells, pneumocytes with cytomegaly and variable amounts of inflammatory cells and foamy macrophages. One case showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. No viral inclusions were found. Coronavirus particles were identified in pneumocytes by electron microscopy. Conclusions: The predominant pathological process of SARS is diffuse alveolar damage and, in patients who die from the disease, there is evidence of organization and fibrosis. There are apparently no histological features specific for this disease, and the aetiological diagnosis depends on virological and ultrastructural studies.
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	Background: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), which can cause hemorrhagic fever-like illness, is a newly discovered bunyavirus in China. The pathogenesis of SFTSV infection is poorly understood. However, it has been suggested that immune mechanisms, including cytokines and chemokines, play an important role in disease pathogenesis. In the present study, we investigated host cytokine and chemokine profiles in serum samples of patients with SFTSV infection from Northeast China and explored a possible correlation between cytokine levels and disease severity. Methods and Principal Findings: Acute phase serum samples from 40 patients, diagnosed with SFTSV infection were included. Patients were divided into two groups -severe or non-severe -based on disease severity. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, transforming growth factor (TGF)-b, interleukin-6, interferon (IFN)-c, IFN-c-induced protein (IP)-10 and RANTES were measured in the serum samples with commercial ELISAs. Statistical analysis showed that increases in TNF-a, IP-10 and IFN-c were associated with disease severity. We suggest that a cytokine-mediated inflammatory response, characterized by cytokine and chemokine production imbalance, might be in part responsible for the disease progression of patients with SFTSV infection.
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	Zika virus (ZIKV) is a highly transmissive virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family, which comprises several other pathogens that threaten human health. This re-emerging virus gained attention during the outbreak in Brazil in 2016, where a considerable number of microcephaly cases in newborns was associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Lacking a preventive vaccine or antiviral drugs, efforts have been made to better understand the viral life cycle. In light of this, the relevance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. A549 and SH-SY5Y cells were infected with either the African strain (associated with mild symptoms) or the French Polynesia strain (associated with neurological complications). For both strains, the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, efficiently inhibited ZIKV entry and prevented the spread of the infection by interfering with viral maturation. Additionally, affecting cholesterol metabolism and transport with the drug U18666A, which inactivates late endosomes and lysosomes, impairs the viral life cycle. The data presented show a clear antiviral effect of two compounds that target the same compartments in different ways. This highlights the relevance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the viral life cycle that should be considered as a target for antivirals. Viruses 2019, 11, 524 2 of 25 life cycle initiates with the interaction between the viral envelope protein and the host cell receptors and adhesion/entry factors, such as DC-SIGN, AXL, Tyro3 and Tim-1 [15] . Nevertheless, there are conflicting data about the relevance of AXL as the primary receptor of ZIKV entry [16] [17] [18] . After internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis, it is assumed that the acidification of the late endosomes, also termed multivesicular bodies (MVBs), promotes a structural change in the viral envelope, allowing the fusion between the endosomal membrane and the envelope. This leads to the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm and, consequently, to the disassembling of the capsid and the uncoating of the viral RNA [19, 20] . After the genomic RNA has been translated and replicated, a newly synthesized immature viral particle is assembled and conducted to the secretory pathway. In this immature form, the pr peptide covers approximately 12 amino acids of the fusion loop of the envelope protein and, thus, prevents premature fusion within the cell. In the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the viral particle undergoes maturation as a result of a structural modification induced by the low pH that allows the cleavage of the prM by a furin-like protease, exposing the fusion loop. Lastly, the infectious viral particle exits the cell by exocytosis and the pr fragment dissociates from the virion due to the neutral pH of the extracellular environment [21, 22] . Besides the bite of an infected mosquito (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), ZIKV infection can occur through perinatal transmission, sexual contact and blood transfusion [23] [24] [25] [26] . Since there is no vaccine or a specific antiviral drug available against ZIKV, understanding the viral life cycle and finding ways to control infection has become urgent. Although the ZIKV life cycle is often described to resemble the life cycle of other flavivirus members, a variety of open questions with respect to the viral life cycle still exists. In light of this, the importance of the endosomal-lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. Firstly, the acidification of the late endosomes/MVBs and the TGN compartments was impaired by the highly selective inhibitor of the vacuolar H + -ATPase (V-ATPase), bafilomycin A1 [27] . The relevance of the acidification of the endosomal compartment for ZIKV entry has been previously studied in Huh 7 cells by Cortese et al., more recently,. Our data from A549 cells show that on the one hand, bafilomycin A1 was able to fully inhibit ZIKV entry and, on the other hand, it interferes with viral maturation. Concerning the SH-SY5Y cells, bafilomycin A1 decreased ZIKV entry. In the second part of this study, the functionality of the late endosomes and lysosomes was hindered by the amphipathic steroid drug, U18666A. U18666A inhibits the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol and lipids by the direct inhibition of the Niemann-Pick type C protein. This results in cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes/MVBs and lysosomes, which leads to the impairment of their functionality [31] . Several reports showed that U18666A inhibits crucial steps of dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus and feline coronavirus life cycles [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, no studies were performed to investigate the impact of U18666A on ZIKV infection. This work provides further insights into the ZIKV life cycle and elucidates crucial steps for viral entry and release.

(1984) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology 10,[173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181][182][183][184] Sequence of murine coronavirus JHM induced neuropathological changes in rats Infection of 21-25-day-old rats with the murine coronavirus JHM was followed either by an acute encephalomyelitis (AE) or subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE). The major neuropathological finding in AE, which developed within 6-12 days p i . consisted of necrotizing lesions distributed mainly in the grey matter of the central nervous system (CNS). SDE developed 14-30 days pi. and affected rats revealed lesions of primary demyelination with predilection sites in the white matter. The time-course for the development of lesions, virus replication and neutralizing antiviral antibody production within the first 3 weeks p.i. were studied. Within the first 2 weeks p.i., most rats showed no clinical signs but nevertheless revealed lesions typical of AE. In parallel to these neuropathological changes infectious virus could be isolated from brain and spinal cord. However, coinciding with multiplication of neutralizing JHM antibodies l(f12 days after infection no infectious virus was recoverable from CNS material. At this time many of the clinically healthy rats showed demyelinating lesions which were located at the typical predilection sites of SDE. These observations indicated that SDE was preceded by clinically silent AE lesions.

Dealing with these issues and the policies and strategies required for mitigation and adaptation need to be given far greater attention by the tourism industry and the public sector than has hitherto been the case. Existing approaches based on crisis and disaster management may be inadequate and a new approach to deal with shocks of this nature is required. This regional spotlight suggests a new approach based on the concept of disruption which is defined as an event that causes substantial and long-term change in the structure of the tourism industry.
779309171edd81f868e4ebf9b6f1526a88acbebf	In this study, an experiment was used to examine the effects of employee norm-violations in the service encounter with respect to what was considered appropriate behavior (e.g., social distancing) during the 2020 corona pandemic. The participants were exposed to a grocery store employee whose behavior was manipulated (norm-violating vs. norm-confirming). Norm-violating behavior resulted in lower perceived employee warmth, lower perceived employee competence, higher disgust, and more dehumanization of the employee. These responses mediated the impact of employee behavior on customer satisfaction, so that satisfaction was attenuated when norms were violated. The mediators, however, typically also instill a hostile, avoidance-seeking mindset for those who are subject to normviolations, which is likely to result in problems when transgressors are to be persuaded to change their behaviors.
ffd7e586bc9e26943b405a2c9498ee5ba3ac8db7	The novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had major impacts on most societies worldwide including the cancelation and postponement of sports events. This has had a major impact on the sports betting industry. The present study is first to investigate the behavior of a sample of online sports bettors before and after COVID-19 measures were put in place by European governments. The authors were given access to the player data by a large European online gambling operator comprising players from Sweden, Germany, Finland, and Norway. The behavioral change of the sports bettors before March 7 and after March 7 (2020) was computed. All sports bettors who placed at least one wager in at least 5 calendar weeks out of the 10 possible calendar weeks between January 1 and March 7 (n = 5396) were included in the analysis. Results showed statistically significant reductions among sports bettors wagering in online casinos. This indicates that there was no conversion of money spent from sports betting to online casino games, at least for this particular online gambling operator. The findings suggest that there was a significant decrease in the amount of money wagered by sports bettors during the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with before it) and that sports bettors did not switch to playing more online casino games and that there was also a significant reduction in playing online casino games among sports bettors.
724e8c320049f5f77366e2f682ab7ccee8cf1573	Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.
23e10c9c7499d54fc7f5d35201bcbd3fa6b212c9	There is an urgent need to develop effective therapies for COVID-19. Here, we urge immunologists and clinicians to consider the potential of targeting the complement system in these patients.
19061b9bda0f77583a288a0f7c43b5ddd9d84bc9	Introduction: In this report, we aim to present our algorithm and results of patients with congenital cardiac disorders who underwent surgical or interventional procedures during the peak phase of the pandemics in our country. Patients and methods: The first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Turkey on 11 March, 2020, and the peak phase seemed to end by the end of April. All the patients whom were referred, treated, or previously operated but still at the hospital during the peak phase of COVID-19 pandemics in the country were included into this retrospective study. Patient's diagnosis, interventions, adverse events, and early post-procedural courses were studied. Results: Thirty-one patients with various diagnoses of congenital cardiovascular disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Ages of the patients ranged between 2 days and 16 years. Seventeen cases were males and 14 cases were females. Elective cases were postponed. Priority was given to interventional procedures, and five cases were treated percutaneously. Palliative procedures were preferred in patients whom presumably would require long hospital stay. Corrective procedures were not hesitated in prioritised stable patients. Mortality occurred in one patient. Eight patients out of 151 ICU admissions were diagnosed with COVID-19, and they were transferred to COVID-19 ICU immediately. Three nurses whom also took care of the paediatric cases became infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, the children did not catch the disease. Conclusion: Mandatory and emergent congenital cardiac percutaneous and surgical procedures may be performed with similar postoperative risks as there are no pandemics with meticulous care and preventive measures.
d8319fda15464d8c6db26d44e1cecff99b708ca9	The current COVID-19 pandemic is not just a medical and social tragedy, but within the threat of the outbreak looms the potential for a significant and persistent negative mental health impact, based on previous experience with other pandemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the earlier H1N1 outbreak of 1918. This piece will highlight the links between depression and viral illnesses and explore important overlaps with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, potentially implicating inflammatory mechanisms in those exposed to a range of viral agents. While containment of psychological distress currently focuses on social anxiety and quarantine measures, a second wave of psychological morbidity due to viral illness may be imminent.
1fe489779a103b0469c72074bf1ac85ec2b8b943	The Geneva Protocol of 1925 commits the signatory nations to refraining from the use of biological weapons. However, the terrorist assaults of September 2001 and, subsequently, the anthrax-containing letters are cause for great concerns: new threats to the security of nations are expected, as terrorist organizations seem to increasingly explore novel ways of spreading terror.In this context, naturally emerging diseases such as SARS, monkeypox or West Nile fever assume new importance because it is difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and possible bioweapon assaults. Great efforts on the part of governments and public health authorities are necessary to counteract these threats.
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	Background: Adults with chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease are more likely to develop complications from a number of vaccine-preventable diseases, including influenza and pneumonia. In this study, we use the data from a chronic disease management information system in Shanghai to estimate vaccination coverage and characterize predictors of seasonal influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) vaccination among people with chronic disease in Shanghai. Methods: The Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have information systems related to chronic disease management, hospital records, and immunizations. Data from individuals with hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were abstracted during July 2017. The main outcome was coverage of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Vaccination coverage was calculated across demographic groups. Significance in bivariate associations was assessed through Pearson's chi-square tests, and in multivariable models through logistic regression models with a forward stepwise method to select variables. Results: In the sample of 2,531,227 individuals ≥15 years, 22.8% were vaccinated for pneumonia from
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	The robustness of immune responses to an antigen could be dictated by the route of vaccine inoculation. Traditional smallpox vaccines, essentially vaccinia virus strains, that were used in the eradication of smallpox were administered by percutaneous inoculation (skin scarification). The modified vaccinia virus Ankara is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in Europe and Canada and currently undergoing clinical development in the United States. MVA is also being investigated as a vector for the delivery of heterologous genes for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization. Since MVA is replication-deficient, MVA and MVAvectored vaccines are often inoculated through the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Vaccine inoculation via the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes requires the use of injection needles, and an estimated 10 to 20% of the population of the United States has needle phobia. Following an observation in our laboratory that a replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus derived from the New York City Board of Health strain elicited protective immune responses in a mouse model upon inoculation by tail scarification, we investigated whether MVA and MVA recombinants can elicit protective responses following percutaneous administration in mouse models. Our data suggest that MVA administered by percutaneous inoculation, elicited vaccinia-specific antibody responses, and protected mice from lethal vaccinia virus challenge, at levels comparable to or better than subcutaneous or intramuscular inoculation. High titers of specific neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice inoculated with a recombinant MVA expressing the herpes simplex type 2 glycoprotein D after scarification. Similarly, a recombinant MVA expressing the hemagglutinin of attenuated influenza virus rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) elicited protective immune responses when administered at low doses by scarification. Taken together, our data suggest that MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines inoculated by scarification can elicit protective immune responses that are comparable to subcutaneous vaccination, and may allow for antigen sparing when vaccine supply is limited.
a11e6a5a0193d8cf80ae5ae6d85ac006257b7c84	We report a case of neurosyphilis mimicking herpes encephalitis. A 42-year-old woman was presented with progressive dementia of six-month long. Brain MRI revealed prominent T2-prolonged lesions in bilateral temporal lobe with frontal atrophy. These lesions were not enhanced by Gd-DTPA and showed hypo signal intensity on DWI. Those imaging findings were resembled with herpes encephalitis or paraneoplasmic limbic encephalitis. Neurosyphilis was diagnosed clinically. Neurosyphilis should be included in the differential diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis. Dural AVF is sometimes associated with intracerebral hemorrhage due to disturbance of venous perfusion. We examined cerebral circulation in patients with retrograde venous drainage using perfusion MRI. Based on our analysis, increase of CBV apparently reflects disturbance of venous perfusion.

33fb40de69545162c559ada7cf0191b7433ebe75	Little is known about the quality of polyclonal antibody responses in COVID-19 patients, and how it correlates with disease severity or patients' prior exposure to other pathogens. The whole polyclonal antibody repertoire in a retrospective cohort of 538 individuals was mapped against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, the main target of antibody immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bioinformatic predictions identified 15 major B cell epitopes for S of SARS-CoV-2. Several epitopes localised in RBD of S including those spanning the ACE2binding site, the highly conserved cryptic epitope of the neutralizing antibody of SARS-CoV, and fusion/entry domains of HR1 and HR2 of S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, some of these epitopes have cross-reactivity to antigens of common pathogens, potentially affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome. High level of anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity in populations with no history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is of clinical relevance and could underpin better understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology in different populations and provide a blueprint for design of effective vaccines and developing better strategies for antibody testing.
afc6b92c3e4cd9bb86d96e19f91c50c58e0a6ab7	The 2019 coronavirus has led to unprecedented strain on healthcare facilities across the United States. Accurately identifying patients at an increased risk of deterioration may help hospitals manage their resources while improving the quality of patient care. Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE ( P redicting I ntensive C are T ransfers and Other U nfo R eseen E vents), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. We compare PICTURE to the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a widespread system which has recently been assessed for use to triage COVID-19 patients. The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to the EDI for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death) at two levels of granularity: (1) maximum score across an encounter with a minimum lead time before the first adverse event and (2) predictions at every observation with instances in the last 24 hours before the adverse event labeled as positive. PICTURE and the EDI were also compared on the encounter level using different lead times extending out to 24 hours. Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. Results -risk patients and consistently outperformed the EDI in both of our cohorts. In non-COVID-19 patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 -0.834) and AUPRC of 0.109 (0.089 -0.125) on the observation level, compared to the EDI AUROC of 0.762 (0.746 -0.780) and AUPRC of 0.077 (0.062 -0.090). On COVID-19 positive patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC of 0.828 (0.794 -0.869) and AUPRC of 0.160 (0.089 -0.199), while the EDI scored an AUROC of 0.792 (0.754 -0.835) and AUPRC of 0.131 (0.092 -0.159). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering a potential incipient second wave of COVID-19 infections. PICTURE also has the ability to explain individual predictions to clinicians by ranking the most important features for a prediction. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.
348be78eb906edde5b1fc35ee6c84c556e77cadf	A patient with COVID-19-related severe respiratory failure, with insufficient response to an antiretroviral therapy, hydroxychloroquine and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonist therapy, presented a prompt resolution of the respiratory function and improvement in the radiological picture after baricitinib at an oral dose of 4 mg per day for 2 weeks.
f43c806e03e126714fb5626cab9e365c9972fd3f	Objective: This study evaluated the potential efficacy of a novel approach to treat COVID-19 patients, using an oxygen-ozone (O 2 -O 3 ) mixture, via a process called Oxygen-Ozone-Immunoceutical Therapy. The methodology met the criteria of a novel, promising approach to treat successfully elderly COVID-19 patients, particularly when hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) Experimental design: We investigated the therapeutic effect of 4 cycles of O 2 -O 3 in 50 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects suffering from acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), aged more than 60 years, all males and undergoing forced mechanical ventilation in ICUs. Following O 2 -O 3 treatment a significant improvement in inflammation and oxygenation indexes occurred rapidly and within the first 9 days after the treatment, despite the expected 14-20 days. A significant reduction of inflammatory and thromboembolic markers (CRP, IL-6, D-dimer) was observed. Furthermore, amelioration in the major respiratory indexes, such as respiratory and gas exchange markers (SatO 2 %, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio), was reported. Our results show that O 2 -O 3 treatment would be a promising therapy for COVID-19 patients. It leads patients to a fast recovery from ARDS via the improvement of major respiratory indexes and blood gas parameters, following a relatively short time of dispensed forced ventilation (about one to two weeks). This study may encourage the scientific community to further investigate and evaluate the proposed method for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
35aa9c986d1dba96f557683d27640699a3c403a0	Purpose of Review COronaVirus Disease 2019 has spread at unprecedented speed and scale into a global pandemic with cardiovascular risk factors and complications emerging as important disease modifiers. We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19. Recent Findings SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive. Summary Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19. Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.
dda902a72728faf3f12e96b6765ed4beb0b57961	Normal epithelial and endothelial renewal and healing after bacterial and viral challenges are essential for homeostasis along the intestine and the blood and lymphatic vessels. We thus investigated whether and how virus affects migration of human epithelial cells and specifically how the nucleocapsid protein (N) modulates the cellular proteome and interactome using human Caco-2 cells in a wound-healing assay with Hazara virus as a model. Here, Hazara virus blocked cell migration in a dose-and time-dependent manner, disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and specifically reduced the expression of the IQ-motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) and water channel aquaporin 6 (AQP6) that regulate cytoskeletal organization, water homeostasis and vesicle communication. Moreover, in the Caco-2 cell proteome, we identified several distinct groups of molecules associating with N upon Hazara virus infection, being involved in the ensemble of important cellular processes, e.g., chaperone activity, metabolism, cellular defense against infections, cell morphology, and migration. These events do not only facilitate the virus life cycle, but they are also crucial for membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics, cellular self-renewal and wound healing, being so essential for body integrity and homeostasis.

During the Level 1 RMPHE, social production and public transport were maintained at minimal levels, and residents stayed in and worked from home. The universal impact of anthropogenic activities on air pollution can be evaluated by comparing it with air quality under such extreme conditions. We investigated the concentration of both gaseous and particulate pollutants and aerosol light absorption at different levels of (RMPHE) in an urban area of southwestern China. During the lockdown, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO x , and BC decreased by 30-50%, compared to the pre-Level 1 RMPHE period. Meanwhile, the decrease of NO x caused the rise of O 3 by up to 2.3 times due to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) limitation. The aerosol light absorption coefficient at multiple wavelengths decreased by 50%, and AAE decreased by 20% during the Level 1 RMPHE. BrC played essential roles in light absorption after the RMPHE was announced, accounting for 54.0% of the aerosol absorption coefficient at 370 nm. Moreover, the lockdown down-weighted the fraction of fossil fuel in BC concentrations to 0.43 (minima). This study characterizes air pollution at the most basic level and can provide policymakers with references for the "baseline." Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3

Immunosuppression can expose cancer patients to serious complications which can lead to delay in diagnosis and unnecessary hospitalizations that may adversely affect the prognosis of the disease. Patients who received chemotherapy or surgery within the 30 days before COVID-19 pandemic have more risk of infection than the patients who had not undergone chemotherapy or surgery.
3b9d3a764b6ae16fd0a5b227e0ed79dc390f1b90	Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are recognized as causal agents in a wide range of human diseases. However, researchers lack sufficient data on the exact HAdV species and serotypes associated with adult acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). To detect and characterize HAdV infections in adults in China, clinical specimens were collected from 10,310 adults with ARTIs from May 2005 to July 2010. The partial HAdV hexon gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed. HAdVs were detected in 86 samples (0.8%), of which 67 (77.9%) were species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14), 7 (8.1%) were species C (HAdV-1, -2, and -6), and 12 (14%) were species E (HAdV-4). HAdV-3 was the most frequently detected serotype (41/86, 47.7%), followed by HAdV-7 (13/86, 15.1%), HAdV-4 (12/86, 14.0%), and HAdV-11 (11/86, 12.8%). Patients 14-25 years old (60.5%) exhibited a higher rate of adenovirus detection than older patients. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses were observed in samples positive for HAdV species B and E. Human rhinovirus was the most commonly found virus in patients with HAdV infection. These findings provide baseline data for the surveillance and control of HAdV infection in China.
13af98c04364a1cc9aaf5afc57a80b60c8b8d2f1	Objectives Enhancement of the potential ability of biomacromolecules to cross cell membranes is a critical step for development of effective therapeutic vaccine especially DNA vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. The supercharged proteins were known as powerful weapons for delivery of different types of cargoes such as DNA and protein. Hence, we applied B1 protein with ? 43 net charges obtained from a single frameshift in the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for delivery of two multiepitope DNA constructs (nef-vpu-gp160-p24 and nefvif-gp160-p24) in vitro and in vivo for the first time. For this purpose, B1 protein was generated in bacterial expression system under native conditions, and used to interact with both DNA constructs. Our data indicated that B1 protein (* 27 kDa) was able to form a stable nanoparticle (* 80-110 nm) with both DNA constructs at nitrogen: phosphate (N: P) ratio of 1:1. Moreover, the transfection efficiency of B1 protein for DNA delivery into HEK-293T cell line indicated that the cellular uptake of nef-vif-gp160-p24 DNA/ B1 and nef-vpu-gp160-p24 DNA/ B1 nanoparticles was about 32-35% with lower intensity as compared to TurboFect commercial reagent. On the other hand, immunization of BALB/c mice with different modalities demonstrated that B1 protein could enhance the levels of antibody, IFN-gamma and Granzyme B eliciting potent and strong Th1-directed cellular immunity. Conclusion Generally, our findings showed the potency of B1 protein as a promising gene delivery system to improve an effective therapeutic vaccine against HIV-1 infection.
4c2e32a9f3d5593712165f1f716bc4dbf549ff7f	Viral infections cause many serious human diseases with high mortality rates. New drug-resistant strains are continually emerging due to the high viral mutation rate, which makes it necessary to develop new antiviral agents. Compounds of plant origin are particularly interesting. The pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs) are a diverse class of natural products from plants composed of three terpene units. They exhibit antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities. Oleanolic, betulinic, and ursolic acids are representative PTs widely present in nature with a broad antiviral spectrum. This review focuses on the recent literatures in the antiviral efficacy of this class of phytochemicals and their derivatives. In addition, their modes of action are also summarized.
bb8206c6c191651b94841df3e6e4599b62fb4f23	The genetically selected high antibody responder mice (Hm) are susceptible and the low antibody responder mice (Lm) are resistant to the experimental infection with Mouse Hepatitis Virus 3 (MHV3). The mortality rates of the F1 hybrids and of the F2 segregants showed the codominance of the susceptible and resistant characters. The direct individual intrapopulation correlation between the induction of antiviral state in macrophages activated by IFN gamma and the resistance to the virus infection, showed that an antiviral state could be induced in resistant mouse macrophages, whereas in susceptible mouse macrophages no restriction of virus replication could be observed. A direct inter-and intrapopulation correlation of pre-existing antibody titres against MHV3 with the mortality and a direct interpopulation correlation of those titres with the mean survival time of susceptible animals was shown. The data indicate, among the mechanisms of resistance against the virus infection, a role of IFN gamma macrophage-activation and of antibodies against MHV3 which may delay the mean survival time in susceptible animals.
0c742273e4a9e7413b14889eca0b2474076c02dc	World Health Organization, on March 11, 2020. Viral detection using RT-qPCR has been among the most important factors helping to control local spread of SARS-CoV-2 and it is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosis. Nevertheless, the RNA extraction step is both laborious and expensive, thus hampering the diagnosis in many places where there are not laboratory staff of funds enough to contribute for diagnosis efforts. Thus, the need to simplify procedures, reduce costs of the techniques used, and expand the capacity of the number of diagnostics of COVID-19 is imperative. In this study, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of RNA extraction has been successfully achieved through pre-treatment of the clinical sample with Proteinase K. The results show that only the use of proteinase K, without the need to perform the whole standard protocol for sample extraction and purification, can be an efficient technique for the diagnosis of COVID-19, since 91% of the samples matched the results with the standard procedure, with an average increase of 5.64 CT in the RT-qPCR.
d9aa5799cf181e58d23cae9873ecea34f669317f	The ORFs 5, 6 and 7, encoding for the three major structural proteins, GP 5 , M and N, of the IAF-Klop strain of PRRSV were cloned and expressed in 293 cells using replication-defective human type 5 adenoviral vectors (hAdVs). Although the M protein gene could be cloned into hAdVs and expressed constituvely in 293 cells under the control of the hCMV immediate early promotor/enhancer, hAdVs expressing N and GP 5 proteins, which appeared to be toxic or interfered with adenovirus replication, could only be generated by inclusion of a tetracycline-regulatable promotor in the transfer vector pAdTR5. The recombinant (rec) proteins appeared similar to the authentic viral proteins in regards to their M r s and antigenicities. However, the recGP 5 apparently possesses different Nlinked oligosaccharides residues. Its sensitivity to endo-β-galactosidase digestion indicates that poly-N-acetyllactosamine is present on the individually-expressed protein, but not on the authentic GP 5 anchored into the virion envelope. The recGP 5 apparently accumulates within the ER compartment as a glycoprotein that possesses high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharide side chains sensitive to endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment, by contrast to its viral counterpart for which N-linked oligosaccharide side chains are of both high-mannose and complex types. Coinfection of 293 cells with hAdVs expressing the M and GP 5 * In memoriam. The authors wish to offer their condolences to the family and friends of Dr. Serge Dea, who died on January 3, 2003, and acknowledge his tremendous accomplishment in the field of Nidoviruses. 952 C. A. Gagnon et al. did not lead to M-GP 5 heterodimer formation, as demonstrated in PRRSV-infected cells. Moreover, cells infected with inducible hAdV/ORF5 showed that GP 5 of the North American strain is proapoptotic. Indeed, when the expression cassette was turned-on, caspase 3 activity in hAdV/ORF5 infected cells was enhanced and DNA fragmentation could be detected by TUNEL assays. Pigs intradermally injected twice with hAdV/ORF5 developed antibody titers to the authentic viral GP 5 as soon as 10 days following challenge with the homologous virulent PRRSV strain, as revealed by Western blot and virus neutralization tests, suggesting the establishment of a specific immune memory.

f35525e55733ac8fa17e3fb3996c559ffcc60e31	The paper will attempt to estimate factors which determine the variability of case fatality rates of COVID-19 across OCED countries in recent time. The objective of the paper is to estimate the impact of government health policy on fatality rates (Case fatality rates) of COVID-19 in countries while controlling for other demographic and economic characteristics. The analysis is of done using non-parametric regression method, i.e. Quantile regression. The result from quartile regressions analysis shows that a policy of Austerity (health expenditure cuts) significantly increases the mortality rates of COVID-19 in OCED countries. The policy implication of the study is the need for a robust public-funded health system with wider accessibility to deals with a major public health crisis like a COVID-19 pandemic.
e57993034cb1196b96daff4505db38640782f4a0	Background: CMV-specific T-cells are crucial to control CMV-replication post-transplant. Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) are associated with a tolerant immune state and may contribute to CMV-replication. However, T-cell subsets such as T-regs and IL-17 producing T-cells (Th-17) are not well studied in this context. We explored T-regs and Th-17 frequencies during CMVreplication after transplantation. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 30 transplant patients with CMV-viremia. We quantified CMV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, T-regs (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + ) and Th-17 frequencies using flow-cytometry and followed patients requiring anti-viral treatment. Two subsets were compared: anti-viral treatment requirement (n = 20) vs. spontaneous clearance of viremia (n = 10). Results: Higher initial CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells and lower T-regs were observed in patients with spontaneous clearance (p = 0.043; p = 0.021 respectively). Using a ratio of CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of viral clearance with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity (p = 0.001). One month after stop of treatment, the same correlation was observed in patients protected from CMV-relapse. The ratio of CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of relapse with 85% sensitivity and 86% specificity (p = 0.004). Th-17 responses were not correlated with virologic outcomes. Conclusions: This study provides novel insights into T-regs and Th-17 subpopulations during CMV-replication after transplantation. These preliminary data suggest that measurement of CMV-specific CD4 + T-cells together with T-regs has value in predicting spontaneous clearance of viremia and relapse.
decdaaf8a2f105ee2eb73294a07209d68dd1fb60	The global COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains across the world, resulting in a critical shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers. To preserve PPE for healthcare providers treating COVID-19 positive patients and to reduce asymptomatic transmission, the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Colorado, Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus collaborated with National Jewish Health to design and test patterns for cloth face coverings. A public campaign to sew and donate the final pattern was launched and over 2500 face coverings have been donated as a result. Now that nearly three million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the United States, many state and local governments are requiring cloth face coverings be worn in public. Here, we present the collaborative design and testing process, as well as the final pattern for non-patient facing hospital workers and community members alike.
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), many researchers in China have immediately carried out clinical research scheme of the COVID-19. But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we made the first systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the control of the COVID-19. Methods: The database from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two evaluators independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. This study is based on the recommendations of PRISMA in Cochrane handbook. Results: A total of 75 COVID-19 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) were obtained. 97.3% of clinical trials were initiated by Chinese organizations. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and all registered clinical trials have not been completed. Most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre-experiment stage (only two trials of Remdesivir in Ⅲ stage), and the sample size of subjects recruited is small. The main intervention methods include traditional Chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment. The subjects were mainly non severe adult patients (≥ 18 years old). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examination. The duration of most trials was more than 5 months, and the median of the intervention study was 180 d (95% CI: 146.3 -328.9 d); the median of the observation period was 334 d (95% CI: 166.6 -363.4 d). Overall, both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in China. However, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.
5620b3dd737e499551fcbcb45de6f8808c7e3362	The epidemiological emergency caused by has changed priorities in breast cancer management. In those places where the pandemic has had the greatest effect, it is of paramount importance for most patients to be at home, reducing or postponing their attendance at clinics, as well as avoiding surgeries. In this scenario, neoadjuvant endocrine treatment could be an appropriate alternative treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer (luminal-like tumours) in order to minimise hospital admissions and to delay elective surgeries. Accordingly, we present a simple protocol that can be applied to most cases of luminal-like breast cancer and is appropriate for the majority of secondary or tertiary medical centres, or even primary care.
b5827a58d3abf603bf7649ada7f69d380e8b3823	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Total cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceed 4.8 million, with over 320,000 deaths recorded. Little is known about the body's immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this paper, we describe SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses in 11,092 patients from the New York City metropolitan area and report a SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rate of nearly 50%, indicating the widespread nature of the pandemic in the city and state of New York. Additionally, we report on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 patient symptom severity and level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody found in the patient sample. A number of in vitro diagnostics have been developed for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and many fraudulent or ineffective tests have been released into the market (13).
0c1fd058b624af98542525f9ab3768ad1b586605	Maps have long been been used to visualise estimates of spatial variables, in particular disease burden and risk. Predictions made using a geostatistical model have uncertainty that typically varies spatially. However, this uncertainty is difficult to map with the estimate itself and is often not included as a result, thereby generating a potentially misleading sense of certainty about disease burden or other important variables. To remedy this, we propose simultaneously visualising predictions and their associated uncertainty within a single map by varying pixel size. We illustrate our approach using examples of malaria incidence, but the method could be applied to predictions of any spatial continua with associated uncertainty.
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	Introduction: The COVID-19 epidemic has led to the need for unprecedented decisions to be made to maintain the provision of neurological care. This article addresses operational decisionmaking during the epidemic. We report the measures taken, including the preparation of a functional reorganisation plan, strategies for hospitalisation and emergency management, the use of telephone consultations to maintain neurological care, provision of care at a unit outside the hospital for priority patients, decisions about complementary testing and periodic in-hospital treatments, and the use of a specific telephone service to prioritise patients with epileptic seizures. Conclusion: Despite the situation of confinement, neurology departments must continue to provide patient care through different means of operation. Like all elements of management, these must be evaluated. : A pesar de la situación de aislamiento, los servicios de neurología deben mantener la atención de sus pacientes a través de distintas fórmulas operativas, que como cualquier elemento de gestión, deberán evaluarse.
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	The spike (S) protein is a major structural glycoprotein of coronavirus (CoV), the causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The S protein is a potent target for SARS-specific cell-mediated immune responses. However, the mechanism CoV pathogenesis in SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a study that leads to the identification of a novel HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from conserved regions of S protein. First, different SARS-CoV sequences were analyzed to predict eight candidate peptides from conserved regions of the S protein based upon HLA-A*0201 binding and proteosomal cleavage. Four of eight candidate peptides were tested by HLA-A*0201 binding assays. Among the four candidate peptides, Sp8 (S 958-966 , VLNDILSRL) induced specific CTLs both ex vivo in PBLs of healthy HLA-A2 + donors and in HLA-A2.1/K b transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding full-length S protein. The immunized mice released IFN-γ and lysed target cells upon stimulation with Sp8 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in comparison to other candidates. These results suggest that Sp8 is a naturally processed epitope. We propose that Sp8 epitope should help in the characterization of mechanisms of virus control and immunopathology in SARS-CoV infection.
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	This study evaluated the efficiency of pediatric mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs used by parents in 203 children aged 6 months to 5 years with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Two nasal samples were collected from each child in a randomised sequence: one by a trained pediatrician and one by a parent. The real-time polymerase chain reaction influenza virus detection rates were similar in the samples collected using the two methods (Cohen's kappa = 0.86), as were the cycle threshold values. In comparison with the pediatrician-collected samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the parental collections were respectively 89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.8-100%) and 97.7% (95% CI: 95.5-100%), and the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 86.2% (95% CI: 73.7-95.1%) and 98.2% (95% CI: 96.4-100%). The children were significantly more satisfied with the parental collections (median values ± standard deviation, 1.59 ± 0.55 vs 3.51 ± 0.36; p < 0.0001). These findings show that mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs specifically designed for infants and children can be used by parents without reducing the influenza virus detection rate. Moreover, the direct involvement of parents significantly increases patient acceptance, thus simplifying collection and suggesting that this novel swab design should be considered for epidemiological surveys and vaccine efficacy studies. Table 2: Cycle threshold (CT) value in the paired samples positive after both pediatrician and parental collection. Virus CT value Pediatrician collection Parental collection Influenza A (n = 5) 29.77 ± 5.45 29.17 ± 4.68 Influenza B (n = 20) 28.59 ± 3.82 29.43 ± 4.27 Mean values ± standard deviation (SD). No significant difference between the two methods of collection.

3db20e37687295cc61a383164929167ec4661989	The delivery of healthcare including the provision of pharmacy services globally is highly 29 regulated internationally in order to protect public health and welfare. However, the onset of 30 the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated the need internationally to amend the model of 31 regulation in order to ensure that people were able to continue to access a range of healthcare 32 services in a timely and effective manner. Many of the changes introduced to the regulation of 33 pharmacy services in Ireland have been replicated in other countries including the introduction 34 of electronic means to transmit prescriptions and other orders for medications, relaxing the 35 legal restrictions in place controlling the emergency supply of prescription only medicines and 36 more fully utilizing the professional competency of pharmacists by empowering them to use 37 their expertise and judgment to support their patients accessing the healthcare services that 38 they need. 39 Many of the regulatory changes that have been introduced to support the COVID-19 public 40 health emergency effort are ones that pharmacists have previously sought to enable them 41 provide a more effective and expanded model of pharmaceutical care to their patients. 42 Accordingly, many pharmacists will want these regulatory changes to be retained and further 43 expanded in the aftermath of the COVID-19 public health emergency in order to extend their 44 scope of practice and support them in the care of their patients. 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f From the outset of the current COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, healthcare professionals 82 worldwide have responded in diverse ways to ensure the safety and optimal care of patients 83 infected with the virus, and those at risk of infection. In the early stages of the pandemic, 84 confusion resulted in some patients self-administering medications with putative benefit to 85 treat the infection and in others, interrupting their prescribed medications for chronic illnesses 86 due to fear of adverse effects, with the potential to cause patient morbidity. Many of these 87 were driven by social media reports advocating positive aspects of some therapies, and 88 negative consequences of on-going administration of others often fueled by misinformation 89 channeled through the COVID-19 infodemic(1-4). Drug shortages resulting from buying 90 unnecessary and excessive quantities of medicines were also common until rationalization and 91 commonsense prevailed on evidence-based advice (1,5-8). 92 With patient safety a priority, the practice and delivery of healthcare in Ireland and 93 internationally has responded, taken action and adapted to the impact of the pandemic, 94 including that of the practice of pharmacy in the hospital and community settings. Hospital 95 pharmacy initiatives centered on comprehensive medicines management protocols and 96 guidelines, re-organization of hospital services and practical changes to the hospital layout in 97 addition to the upskilling of clinical pharmacists(9-14). Both sectors were required to minimize 98 the potential infection risk to both themselves and their patients resulting in marked changes in 99 staffing (e.g. formation of staff pods), the use of precautionary personal protective equipment, 100 changes to pharmacy floor layouts to ensure social distancing was maintained and innovative 101 communication strategies between patients and fellow healthcare workers(15-20). The 102 potential for targeted community pharmacy activities were highlighted shortly after the country 103 went into preventive lockdown(21). The drivers and barriers to adapting community pharmacy 104 services in the face of the pandemic has recently been reported by Hoti et al and provides an 105 indication of the need for policymakers and regulatory authorities to address the needs of 106 community pharmacies to ensure better delivery of pharmacy services in the community(22). 107 Telehealth and telemedicine healthcare initiatives to maintain patient care have flourished 108 during the pandemic and may be the precursor for sustained change (23-29). This may also be 109 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f emulated in the community pharmacy setting where telepharmacy or telehealth consultations 110 may become the 'new normal '(23,30). However, such initiatives will inevitably require changes 111 to current legal frameworks in place to regulate the delivery of pharmacy services. 112 Changes to the delivery of pharmacy services in light of emerging pandemic situation were 113 131 professionals including pharmacists, doctors, nurses and dentists who were previously 132 registered with the relevant regulatory authority but who wished return to professional 133 practice to assist with the pandemic effort, to renew their registration quickly and efficiently. In 134 relation to pharmacists, Section 12 of the Act amended the Pharmacy Act 2007 to introduce a 135 new section to it, Section 77, which allowed previously registered pharmacists who were no 136 longer registered, to be restored temporarily to the Register of Pharmacists in Ireland(32). The 137 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 161 The changes in the Medicinal Products (Prescription & Control of Supply) (Amendment) 162 Regulations achieve this through a range of means including (Table 1)(35): 163 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 189 the PSI in addition to other advice and guidance(37). 190 Discussion 191 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 420

d7c667bcfa6796ea4001a378c1e567d25e55efd2	Background: Direct evidence of lung cancer risk in Asian users of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is lacking. Methods: The ACEI cohort comprised 22,384 patients aged ≥ 18 years with a first prescription of ACEI. The comparison angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) cohort consisted of age-, sex-and comorbidity-matched patients at a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome was the incidence of lung cancer, which was evaluated using a proportional hazard model. Results: The overall incidence rates of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB cohorts were 16.6 and 12.2 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The ACEI cohort had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer than the ARB cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]. = 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]. = 1.11-1.67). Duration-response and dose-response analyses revealed that compared with patients who did not receive ACEIs, patients who received ACEIs for more than 45 days per year (aHR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.48-2.36) and patients who received more than 540 defined daily doses of ACEIs per year (aHR =1.80; 95% CI = 1.43-2.27) had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer. The cumulative incidence of lung cancer was also significantly higher in the ACEI cohort than in the ARB cohort (log-rank test, p = 0.002). Conclusions: ACEI use is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer compared with ARB use. Patients using ARBs have a significantly lower risk of lung cancer than non-ARB users.
b2b1757358f9a49047fbea130108f7724f6c4917	pandemic of this era. Although adults and the elderly are most severely affected, children and neonates have been affected to a lesser extent [1] . Studies on pregnant mothers with COVID-19 published until date have shown limited evidence supporting vertical transmission [2] . We would like to report our first case of COVID-19 in a preterm neonate who contracted the infection in the second week of life, that prompted us to strengthen infection control measures. A 33-wk-old neonate was born by emergency cesarean section due to maternal complications. He was born in poor condition. He was intubated, given surfactant and ventilated for 72 h. He was extubated on to humidified high flow until day 5 of life. On day 9 of life, he became unwell with poor feed tolerance and respiratory distress requiring non-invasive ventilation. Chest X-ray showed patchy consolidation of right mid-zone and left peri-hilar region suggestive of infection. Blood results showed a mild elevation of CRP to 14 mg/L (Normal <10 mg/L) and a raised platelet count. Due to this clinical deterioration and chest X-ray findings, intravenous antibiotics were commenced. Respiratory secretions for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza were negative, but surprisingly COVID-19 RT-PCR was positive. The parents had shown no signs of illness suggestive of COVID-19 over the previous 14 d and reported no contacts with others with suspected COVID-19. He was isolated and barrier nursed with the recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) until repeat COVID swab was negative at 12 d. A five days course of intravenous antibiotics was given. The parents were asked to self-isolate for 14 d and remained well throughout isolation. Following this case, existing infection control measures were strengthened and our threshold for screening neonates for COVID-19 were lowered. Visitors to neonatal unit were restricted and all parents were risk assessed. As COVID-19 had become endemic by this time, staff were advised to don appropriate PPE while attending all deliveries in hospital. All neonates who were admitted and/or requiring new respiratory support were screened for COVID-19.
5d36857d0cdaff4320e21e718bdc2e12599ef124	Background: Since 2010, outbreaks of genotype 2 (G2) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have caused high mortality in neonatal piglets and have had devastating impacts on the swine industry in many countries. A reliable serological assay for evaluating the PEDV-specific humoral and mucosal immune response is important for disease survey, monitoring the efficacy of immunization, and designing strategies for the prevention and control of PED. Two PEDV spike (S) glycoprotein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed using G2b PEDV-Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT) trimeric full-length S and truncated S 1-501 proteins derived from the human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell expression system. The truncated S 1-501 protein was selected from a superior expressed stable cell line. The sensitivity and specificity of these two ELISAs were compared to immunostaining of G2b PEDV-PT infected cells and to a commercial nucleocapsid (N)-based indirect ELISA kit using a panel of PEDV negative and hyperimmune sera. The commercial N-based ELISA exhibited a sensitivity of 37%, a specificity of 100%, and a fair agreement (kappa = 0.37) with the immunostaining result. In comparison, the full-length S-based ELISA showed a sensitivity of 97.8%, a specificity of 94%, and an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.90) with the immunostaining result. Interestingly, the S 1-501 -based ELISA had even higher sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 99.1%, and an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.97) with the immunostaining result. A fair agreement (kappa< 0.4) was seen between the commercial N-based ELISA and either of our S-based ELISAs. However, the results of the full-length S-based ELISA shared an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.92) with that of S 1-501 -based ELISA. (Continued on next page)
a1d48eb64fd13e2a1e117a386b81980b4a98430e	Coronavirus envelope (E) protein is a small integral membrane protein with multi-functions in virion assembly, morphogenesis and virus-host interaction. Different coronavirus E proteins share striking similarities in biochemical properties and biological functions, but seem to adopt distinct membrane topology. In this report, we study the membrane topology of the SARS-CoV E protein by immunofluorescent staining of cells differentially permeabilized with detergents and proteinase K protection assay. It was revealed that both the N-and C-termini of the SARS-CoV E protein are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membranes (N cyto C cyto ). In contrast, parallel experiments showed that the E protein from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spanned the membranes once, with the N-terminus exposed luminally and the C-terminus exposed cytoplasmically (N exo(lum) -C cyto ). Intriguingly, a minor proportion of the SARS-CoV E protein was found to be modified by N-linked glycosylation on Asn 66 and inserted into the membranes once with the C-terminus exposed to the luminal side. The presence of two distinct membrane topologies of the SARS-CoV E protein may provide a useful clue to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.
0b694e233e30a6df59c27f0982c5f9126e934926	Ever since the discovery of SARS-CoV in the year 2003, numerous researchers around the world have been working relentlessly to understand the biology of this virus. As in other coronaviruses, nucleocapsid (N) is one of the most crucial structural components of the SARS-CoV. Hence major attention has been focused on characterization of this protein. Independent studies conducted by several laboratories have elucidated significant insight into the primary function of this protein, which is to encapsidate the viral genome. In addition, many reports also suggest that this protein interferes with different cellular pathways, thus implying it to be a key regulatory component of the virus too. In the first part of this review, we will discuss these different properties of the N-protein in a consolidated manner. Further, this protein has also been proposed to be an efficient diagnostic tool and a candidate vaccine against the SARS-CoV. Hence, towards the end of this article, we will discuss some recent progress regarding the possible clinically relevant use of the N-protein. #
7ebedf373e4b3c414333bdd7be729cfbcab489b3	Epidemiology Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus Mathematical modelling South Korea Background: Effective countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases require an understanding of transmission rate and basic reproduction number (R 0 ). R 0 for severe acute respiratory syndrome is generally considered to be >1, whereas that for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is considered to be <1. However, this does not explain the large-scale outbreaks of MERS that occurred in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and South Korean hospitals. Aim: To estimate R 0 in nosocomial outbreaks of MERS. Methods: R 0 was estimated using the incidence decay with an exponential adjustment model. The KSA and Korean outbreaks were compared using a line listing of MERS cases compiled using publicly available sources. Serial intervals to estimate R 0 were assumed to be six to eight days. Study parameters [R 0 and countermeasures (d)] were estimated by fitting a model to the cumulative incidence epidemic curves using Matlab. Findings: The estimated R 0 in Korea was 3.9 in the best-fit model, with a serial interval of six days. The first outbreak cluster in a hospital in Pyeongtaek had an R 0 of 4.04, and the largest outbreak cluster in a hospital in Samsung had an R 0 of 5.0. Assuming a six-day serial interval, the KSA outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh had R 0 values of 3.9 and 1.9, respectively. Conclusion: R 0 for the nosocomial MERS outbreaks in KSA and South Korea was estimated to be in the range of 2e5, which is significantly higher than the previous estimate of <1. Therefore, more comprehensive countermeasures are needed to address these infections.
37e868bd5665ee09b7ef8d3a0727c0598cd6a965	A new type of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which was identified on January 7th, 2020; which caused disease named COVID-19 caused by this virus. The first confirmed COVID-19 (+) case in Turkey was detected on March 11 th , 2020. The first COVID-19 case in Antalya was detected on March 14 th , 2020 and transferred by an Antalya 112 emergency ambulance to hospital. The aim of this descriptive, retrospective and cross-sectional study which is conducted between the dates of March 14th, 2020 -May 31st, 2020, is to evaluate the level of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage, the risk analysis results and follow-up measures of Antalya 112 ambulance teams during COVID-19 outbreak. There were 5344 possible and 787 confirmed COVID-19 (+) positive ambulance cases between the dates of study conducted. The majority of these cases were male (62%) and over the age of 65 (47%). The majority of cases were result in "transferred to healthcare facilities" (75.48%). The total 2361 ambulance team workers were taken to risk analysis measurements and then followed-up procedures. The majority of ambulance team members were assessed with no risk available. The Level-4 PPE (N95/FPP-Goggle/face protection-Gloves-Apron/coverall) were used most commonly (84.50%). The HCWs who use Level-4 PPE for confirmed COVID-19 (+) cases, were assessed no risk exposed. The using mask on patient and the level of PPE usage showed negative correlation with risk level of HCWs. There are only 2 HCWs diagnosed with COVID-19 by CT scan. The follow-up procedures of two HCWs has been finalized, and both of them cured, follow-ups ended. The studies about easy-to-use, high-tech PPE with maximum protection, are recommended for further investigations.
18abe8d74439ccfbac34c82f5f167ed69ab123a5	COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has several enzymes that could be targeted by antivirals including a 2'-O RNA methyltransferase (MTase) that is involved in the viral RNA cap formation; an essential process for RNA stability. This MTase is composed of two nonstructural proteins, the nsp16 catalytic subunit and the activating nsp10 protein. We have solved the crystal structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex bound to the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin in the active site. Based on the structural data we built a model of the MTase in complex with RNA that illustrates the catalytic reaction. A structural comparison to the Zika MTase revealed low conservation of the catalytic site between these two RNA viruses suggesting preparation of inhibitors targeting both these viruses will be very difficult. Together, our data will provide the information needed for structure-based drug design.

Scientific Opinion on an alternative method for the hygienic treatment of bovine colostrum through a series of filtration steps. An alternative method to the HTST treatment (High Temperature Short Time pasteurisation at 72 °C for at least 15 seconds or equivalent pasteurisation effect achieving a negative reaction to a phosphatase test), approved for the treatment of bovine colostrum (Category 3 material), was assessed. The purpose of the alternative method, based on a series of filtration steps, is the production of Colostrinov, a product whose main ingredient is bovine colostrum, to be used for foal nutrition. Since the filtration techniques used are known to eliminate particles of the size of bacteria, fungi and protozoa from liquids, it is reasonable to assume that the microfiltration process reduces these contaminants to a level at least equivalent to the treatment required by the legislation. Owing to their small size, viruses are not retained by the mechanical effect of the filters but they may be retained by physico-chemical interactions with the surface of the filter, depending on the surface properties of the viruses and those of the filter, as well as on the properties of the surrounding liquid. From the information provided by the applicant, it cannot be concluded whether or not the microfiltration process reduces the relevant viral contaminants to a level at least equivalent to a single HTST treatment as required by the legislation.
bfc558a4241a48e116131d26ece914f715b53d10	Upon maturation, primary rat oligodendrocytes become resistant to coronavirus JHM (JHMV) infection at an early stage. Involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK) in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation has been established (S. Beushausen et al. (1987). J. Virol. 61,[3795][3796][3797][3798][3799][3800][3801][3802][3803]. An inducer which accelerates maturation, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) also upregulates the expression of the regulatory subunit, R1 of PK1. Since (i) early block preventing infection of mature oligodendrocytes can be bypassed when transfection with genomic RNA is used and (ii) inhibitors of PKs counteract the dbcAMP effect, so as to alleviate the inhibition of JHMV, enhanced expression of R1 appeared to be connected with virus restriction. This idea was confirmed following upregulation of the R1 gene in fully permissive L-2 cells. There was a connection between an effect due to R1 and dephosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein N by an endosomal phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPPase) having the properties of types 1 or 2A enzyme which occurs during penetration of inoculum virions. An inhibition in vitro (cell free) of N dephosphorylation by R1 together with evidence that in vivo (cell culture) overexpression of R1 inhibited the endosomal PPPase as well as replication of JHMV supports the hypothesis that uncoating of the JHMV inoculum occurs after dephosphorylation, a step obligatory for dissociation of the N protein from the genome. Thus inhibition by R prevents uncoating and thereby interferes with the commencement of replication. These observations intimate the existence of a novel mechanism controlling a virus infection of specific cell target(s) undergoing a process of differentiation and maturation in the central nervous system. ᭧
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	This paper assesses the age specificity of the infection fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19. Our benchmark meta-regression synthesizes the age-specific IFRs from four recent large-scale seroprevalence studies conducted in Belgium, Geneva, Spain, and Sweden. The estimated IFR is close to zero for children and younger adults but rises exponentially with age, reaching about 0.3 percent for ages 50-59, 1 percent for ages 60-69, 4 percent for ages 70-79, and 24 percent for ages 80 and above. We compare those predictions to the age-specific IFRs implied by recent seroprevalence studies of six U.S. geographical areas, three small scale studies, and three countries (Iceland, New Zealand, and Republic of Korea) that have engaged in comprehensive tracking and tracing of COVID-19 infections. We also review more than 30 other seroprevalence studies whose design was not well-suited for estimating age-specific IFRs. Our findings indicate that COVID-19 is not just dangerous for the elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle-aged adults, for whom the fatality rate is roughly 50 times greater than the risk of dying in an automobile accident. Consequently, the overall IFR for a given location is intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. In a scenario where the U.S. infection rate reaches nearly 30 percent, our analysis indicates that protecting vulnerable age groups could prevent over 200,000 deaths. Objective: Determine age-specific infection fatality rates for COVID-19 to inform public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups. Methods: Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports identified by online searches. A total of 48 studies were identified covering a wide array of locations in advanced economies. Studies were screened using four specific criteria: (i) transparency of seroprevalence test characteristics and procedures; (ii) representative sample of the general population; (iii) effective pandemic containment by the time of the study; and (iv) reporting of age-specific prevalence and confidence intervals. Age-specific IFRs were computed using reported fatalities four weeks after the midpoint date of each study, reflecting the typical pattern of lags in fatalities and reporting. Four studies were identified as benchmarks and used in meta-regression of the infection fatality rate (IFR) as a function of age, using the STATA metareg procedure. The meta-regression results were compared with age-specific IFRs for 12 other locations --an "out-of-sample" exercise that statisticians commonly use in assessing the validity of forecasting models. Results: Our analysis finds a highly significant exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFRs are close to zero for children and younger adults but rise to about 0.3 percent for ages 50-59, 1 percent for ages 60-69, 4 percent for ages 70-79, and 24 percent for ages 80 and above. Nearly all of the age-specific IFRs from all 16 studies fall within the 95% prediction interval of the meta-regression. Discussion: Our analysis indicates that the link between IFR and age is far stronger than the link with comorbidities such as chronic pulmonary disease. Other recent studies indicate that other characteristics-including race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status-are not tightly linked to IFR but are strongly tied to infection rates and hence to disparities in mortality outcomes. Our results clearly indicate that COVID-19 is not just dangerous for the elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle-aged adults, for whom the fatality rate is roughly 50 times greater than the risk of dying in an automobile accident. Furthermore, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as an exogenously fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, individual and collective efforts that minimize infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths. In a scenario where the infection rate of the U.S. population reaches nearly 30%, our analysis indicates that protecting vulnerable age groups could prevent over 200,000 deaths. : medRxiv preprint 2 recent meta-analysis noted the high degree of heterogeneity across aggregate estimates of IFR and concluded that research on age-stratified IFR is "urgently needed to inform policymaking." 2 In this paper, we consider the hypothesis that the observed variation in IFR across locations may primarily reflect the age specificity of COVID-19 infections and fatalities. In particular, the overall IFR for a given location can be expressed as follows: = * * using data for N distinct age groups, where denotes the share of age group a in the total population, denotes that age group's COVID-19 infection rate, and denotes that age group's infection fatality rate. Demographic information about the age structure for a given location is readily available from census data. Consequently, a crucial task is to use seroprevalence data to assess age-specific infection rates and IFRs. Rather than focusing on any single location, we proceed by conducting meta-analysis using data from a wide array of distinct locations, drawn from a total of 48 recent studies of COVID-19 prevalence. We begin by highlighting key characteristics of studies that are essential for assessing age-specific IFRs, including the use of a broadly representative sample of the general population, seroprevalence methods with high positive predictive power, and tabulation of fatalities that are appropriately linked to the dates of the seroprevalence testing. Based on those criteria, we exclude 32 other seroprevalence studies that are not suitable for estimating age-specific IFRs. Using these criteria, we identify four seroprevalence studies that serve as benchmarks: Belgium, Geneva, Spain, and Sweden. Applying meta-regression methods to this set of benchmark studies, we estimate a log-linear relationship between IFR and age and obtain precise coefficients that are not significantly influenced by outliers. In particular, the estimated IFR is close to zero for children and younger adults but increases exponentially with age, reaching about 0.5 percent for ages 55-64, 1.6 percent for ages 65-74, and exceeding 6 percent for ages 70+. Next, we compare these meta-regression predictions to the age-specific IFRs implied by recent seroprevalence studies of six U.S. geographical areas (Connecticut, South Florida, Missouri, New York, Utah, and Puget Sound) as well as three countries (Iceland, Korea, and New Zealand) that have engaged in comprehensive tracking and tracing of COVID-19 infections. We also compare these results with three small-scale seroprevalence studies (Castiglione d'Adda, Gangelt, and the Diamond Princess cruise ship) and with the pathbreaking study of that was conducted at a very early stage of the pandemic.

77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	Background: Co-infection of different influenza A viruses is known to occur but how viruses interact within co-infection remains unknown. An outbreak in a college campus during the 2009 pandemic involved two subtypes of influenza A: persons infected with pandemic A/H1N1; persons infected with seasonal A/H3N2 viruses; and persons infected with both at the same time (co-infection). This provides data to analyse the possible interaction between influenza A viruses within co-infection. Methods: We extend a statistical inference method designed for outbreaks caused by one virus to that caused by two viruses. The method uses knowledge of which subtype each case is infected with (and whether they were co-infected), contact information and symptom onset date of each case in the influenza outbreak. We then apply it to construct the most likely transmission tree during the outbreak in the college campus. Results: Analysis of the constructed transmission tree shows that the simultaneous presence of the two influenza viruses increases the infectivity and the transmissibility of A/H1N1 virus but whether it changes the infectivity of A/H3N2 is unclear. The estimation also shows that co-transmission of both subtypes from co-infection is low and therefore co-infection cannot be sustained on its own. Conclusions: This study suggests that influenza A viruses within co-infected patients can interact in some ways rather than transmit independently, and this can enhance the spread of influenza A virus infection.

97387ea65a5d573778c09417b975ca702d179773	Due to the high perceived risk, it is critical to foster users' initial trust in the promotion of mobile online health community (MOHC) adoption. The present study focused on the role of two different trust elements and examined the initial trust building process based on elaboration likelihood model and trust transfer theory. The results indicated that initial trust in MOHC context was composed of two interrelated components: health service provider (doctor) and underlying technology (MOHC platform). Especially, the initial trust in MOHC platform exerted greater effects on adopting intention. Both performance-based cue (doctors' information quality and interaction quality) and transfer-based cue (trust in the offline doctors' health service) positively shaped the initial trust in doctor. Meanwhile, only the performance-based cue (MOHC platform's information quality and service quality) has significant positive association with initial trust in MOHC platform. However, interpersonal recommend is insignificantly related to the initial trust in doctor. Trust in the mobile internet service is insignificantly related to the initial trust in MOHC platform.
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	The German government has made it mandatory to wear respiratory masks covering mouth and nose (MNC) as an effective strategy to fight SARS-CoV-2 infections. In many countries, this directive has been extended on shopping malls or public transportation. The aim of this paper is to critically analyze the statutory regulation to wear protective masks during the COVID-19 crisis from a medical standpoint. We performed an extensive query of the most recent publications addressing the prevention of viral infections including the use of face masks in the community as a method to prevent the spread of the infection. We addressed the issues of practicability, professional use, and acceptability based on the community and the environment where the user resided. Results: Upon our critical review of the available literature, we found only weak evidence for wearing a face mask as an efficient hygienic tool to prevent the spread of a viral infection. However, the use of MNC seems to be linked to relevant protection during close contact scenarios by limiting pathogen-containing aerosol and liquid droplet dissemination. Importantly, we found evidence for significant respiratory compromise in patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease, secondary to the development of hypercapnia. This could also happen in patients with lung infections, with or without SARS-CoV-2. Epidemiologists currently emphasize that wearing MNC will effectively interrupt airborne infections in the community. The government and the politicians have followed these recommendations and used them to both advise and, in some cases, mandate the general population to wear MNC in public locations. Overall, the results seem to suggest that there are some clinically relevant scenarios where the use of MNC necessitates more defined recommendations. Our critical evaluation of the literature both highlights the protective effects of certain types of face masks in defined risk groups, and emphasizes their potential risks. © The Author(s) 2020.

07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	With the rapid outbreak of COVID-19, most people are facing antivirus mask shortages. Therefore, it is necessary to reasonably select antivirus masks and optimize the use of them for everyone. However, the uncertainty of the effects of COVID-19 and limits of human cognition add to the difficulty for decision makers to perfectly realize the purpose. To maximize the utility of the antivirus mask, we proposed a decision support algorithm based on the novel concept of the spherical normal fuzzy (SpNoF) set. In it, firstly, we analyzed the new score and accuracy function, improved operational rules, and their properties. Then, in line with these operations, we developed the SpNoF Bonferroni mean operator and the weighted Bonferroni mean operator, some properties of which are also examined. Furthermore, we established a multi-criteria decision-making method, based on the proposed operators, with SpNoF information. Finally, a numerical example on antivirus mask selection over the COVID-19 pandemic was given to verify the practicability of the proposed method, which the sensitive and comparative analysis was based on and was conducted to demonstrate the availability and superiority of our method.
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	The activation of astrocytes and microglia is often associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Understanding how activation alters the transcriptome of these cells may offer valuable insight regarding how activation of these cells mediate neurological damage. Furthermore, identifying common and unique pathways of gene expression during activation may provide new insight into the distinct roles these cells have in the CNS during infection and inflammation. Since recent studies indicate that TLR7 recognizes not only viral RNA but also microRNAs that are released by damaged neurons and elevated during neurological diseases, we first examined the response of glial cells to TLR7 stimulation using microarray analysis. Microglia were found to generate a much stronger response to TLR7 activation than astrocytes, both in the number of genes induced as well as fold induction. Although the primary pathways induced by both cell types were directly linked to immune responses, microglia also induced pathways associated with cellular proliferation, while astrocytes did not. Targeted analysis of a subset of the upregulated genes identified unique mRNA, including Ifi202b which was only upregulated by microglia and was found to be induced during both retroviral and bunyavirus infections in the CNS. In addition, other genes including Birc3 and Gpr84 as well as two expressed sequences AW112010 and BC023105 were found to be induced in both microglia and astrocytes and were upregulated in the CNS following virus infection. Thus, expression of these genes may a useful measurement of glial activation during insult or injury to the CNS. Astrocyte and microglia cultures were prepared from the brain cortex of 1-2 day old Inbred Rocky Mountain White (IRW) mice as previously described [20] . In brief, brain tissue was removed from multiple animals at 2 days of age and placed in ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Hind brains, mid brains, and meninges were dissected out.

be4f7c9109a242bfea7c73dbb551238cf598e690	Attenuated measles virus (MV) is one of the most effective and safe vaccines available, making it attractive candidate vector to prevent infectious diseases. Attenuated MV have acquired the ability to use the complement regulator CD46 as a major receptor to mediate virus entry and intercellular fusion. Therefore, attenuated MV strains preferentially infect and destroy a wide variety of cancer cells making them also attractive oncolytic vectors. The use of recombinant MV vector has to comply with various regulatory requirements, particularly relating to the assessment of potential risks for human health and the environment. The present article highlights the main characteristics of MV and recombinant MV vectors used for vaccination and virotherapy and discusses these features from a biosafety point of view.
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	Influenza pandemics have been amongst the largest and the deadliest epidemics in the history of man, and were observed already in ancient times. For example, records from the fifth century B.C. suggest that influenza pandemics were observed in ancient Greece. In Europe, during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, numerous concordant reports from different countries describe epidemics of respiratory infections that resemble influenza pandemics. However, it is not possible to be certain that these epidemics were due to influenza. In the twentieth century, three influenza pandemics have occurred, including the deadly Spanish flu pandemic. Modern virology has unravelled the mechanisms of emergence of pandemic viruses, and considerable knowledge on influenza viruses has been accumulated. The picture is now clear: influenza A is a zoonotic virus whose reservoir is in wild birds. In rare cases, these avian viruses are introduced into man and, eventually, become pandemic viruses. Although these mechanisms are now understood, the time frame required for adaptation of the avian virus to its new host remains unknown. Maybe the next pandemic will show us how rapid this adaptation can be.

We invited LT recipients from the Liver Transplant Follow-up Center of the University Hospital of Salerno to access remote consultation. A subgroup of them also participated in a self-administered, internet-based survey evaluating demographics; LT data and immunosuppressive therapy; comorbidities; attitudes towards COVID-19 infection; their perceptions of the need for health care, and their approach to telemedicine. Seventy-four/one hundred and fifty-three (48.3%) LT recipients were unable to access remote consultation. They showed a significantly higher mean age and a higher percentage of low school degree compared to those who accessed it (p=0.03 and p=0.001, respectively). Among the remaining LT recipients, 50/79 (63.3%) responded to the survey; mean time from liver transplantation was 12±7 years; 94% of the sample reported at least one comorbidity; 44% of LT recipients declared to be "very much/much" worried because of COVID-19 infection, and 64% considered themselves more vulnerable than the general population. Forty percent of responders refused the routine follow-up visit, and 62% were very interested in using Telemedicine. LT recipients were anxious because of COVID-19 infection and considered themselves more vulnerable than the general population, refusing the routine clinical visit. For continuing services during the COVID-19 era, new strategies are needed and telemedicine shows promise.
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	New systems genetics approaches are needed to rapidly identify host genes and genetic networks that regulate complex disease outcomes. Using genetically diverse animals from incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross mouse panel, we demonstrate a greatly expanded range of phenotypes relative to classical mouse models of SARS-CoV infection including lung pathology, weight loss and viral titer. Genetic mapping revealed several loci contributing to differential disease responses, including an 8.5Mb locus associated with vascular cuffing on chromosome 3 that contained 23 genes and 13 noncoding RNAs. Integrating phenotypic and genetic data narrowed this region to a single gene, Trim55, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a role in muscle fiber maintenance. Lung pathology and transcriptomic data from mice genetically deficient in Trim55 were used to validate its role in SARS-CoV-induced vascular cuffing and inflammation. These data establish the Collaborative Cross platform as a powerful genetic resource for uncovering genetic contributions of complex traits in microbial disease severity, inflammation and virus replication in models of outbred populations. New emerging pathogens are a significant threat to human health with at least six highly pathogenic viruses, including four respiratory viruses, having spread from animal hosts into the human population within the past 15 years. With the emergence of new pathogens, new and better animal models are needed in order to better understand the disease these pathogens cause; to assist in the rapid development of therapeutics; and importantly to evaluate the role of natural host genetic variation in regulating disease outcome. We used incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross, a newly available recombinant inbred mouse panel, to identify polymorphic host genes that contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We discovered new animal models that better capture the range of disease found in human SARS patients and also found four novel susceptibility loci governing various aspects of SARS-induced pathogenesis. By integrating statistical, genetic and bioinformatic approaches we were able to narrow candidate genome regions to highly likely candidate genes. We narrowed one locus to a single candidate gene, Trim55, and confirmed its role in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV infection through the use of knockout mice.

ca0cc9c9da1307a7f36276eea4d117d6f74c2d7f	Coronaviruses are a family of large positive-sense RNA viruses that are responsible for a wide range of important veterinary and human diseases. Nsp1 has been shown to have an important role in the pathogenetic mechanisms of coronaviruses in vivo. To assess the function of a relatively conserved domain (LLRKxGxKG) of MHV nsp1, a mutant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, with a 27 nts (LLRKxGxKG) deletion in nsp1, was constructed using a reverse genetic system with a vaccinia virus vector. The mutant virus had similar growth kinetics to MHV-A59 wild-type virus in 17CI-1 cells, but was highly attenuated in vivo. Moreover, the mutant virus completely protected C57BL/6 mice from a lethal MHV-A59 challenge. To further analyze the mechanism of the attenuation of the mutant virus, changes in reporter gene expression were measured in nsp1-or nsp1-27D-expressing cells; the results showed that nsp1 inhibited reporter gene expression controlled by different promoters, but that this inhibition was reduced for nsp1-27D. The research in vivo and in vitro suggests that the LLRKxGxKG region of nsp1 may play an important role in this process.

La mayoría de ellas son debidas a infecciones víricas. Este estudio pretende precisar las características clínicas y epidemiológicas de los pacientes adultos con infección respiratoria por los coronavirus OC43, NL63 y 229E. Pacientes y métodos: Entre enero del 2013 y febrero del 2014 se estudió prospectivamente a todos los pacientes con sospecha clínica de infección respiratoria mediante la toma de un frotis faríngeo y la realización de una reacción en cadena de la polimerasa en transcripción reversa en tiempo real en búsqueda de coronavirus. Resultados: En 48 casos (7,0% de los 686 pacientes incluidos; 12,6% de los 381 en los que se detectó algún virus) se pudo demostrar la presencia de algún coronavirus. En 24 casos se trataba del OC43 (50%), en 14 del NL63 (29%) y en 10 del 229E (21%). La edad media fue de 54,5 años, con un ligero predominio de varones. Las presentaciones clínicas más frecuentes fueron el cuadro gripal inespecífico (43,7%), la neumonía (29,2%) y la agudización de enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica (8,3%). El 52% de los pacientes precisaron ingreso hospitalario, en 2 ocasiones en cuidados intensivos. No se produjo ningún fallecimiento. Conclusión: Las infecciones respiratorias agudas causadas por coronavirus inciden preferentemente en varones fumadores en la edad media de la vida, frecuentemente afectados de enfermedades previas. La sintomatología clínica mas frecuente ha sido el cuadro gripal inespecífico. Abstract Background and objectives: Acute respiratory infection is a very common condition in the general population.

6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	Background: This study examined the effectiveness of a theoretical framework that integrates self-determination theory (SDT) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in explaining the use of facemasks to prevent seasonal influenza among Hong Kong older adults. Methods: Data were collected at two time points in the winter in Hong Kong, during which influenza is most prevalent. At Time 1, older adults (N = 141) completed self-report measures of SDT (perceived autonomy support from senior center staff, autonomous motivation for influenza prevention) and TPB (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention for influenza prevention) constructs with respect to facemask used to prevent infection. Two weeks later, at Time 2, participants' acceptance of a facemask to prevent influenza in the presence of an experimenter with flu-like symptoms was recorded. Results: Path analysis found that perceived autonomy support of senior center staff was positively and significantly linked to autonomous motivation for facemask use, which, in turn, was positively related to intentions to wear facemasks through the mediation of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. However, the effect of intention on facemask use was not significant. Conclusions: Results generally support the proposed framework and the findings of previous studies with respect to intention, but the non-significant intention-behavior relationship may warrant future research to examine the reasons for older adults not to wear facemasks to prevent seasonal influenza despite having positive intentions to do so.
b7571b376191a573347efef4a351927786131baa	The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19, broadly referred to as "coronavirus") a global pandemic, while thousands of infections and deaths are reported daily. The current article explores the food systems in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. It provides insights about the properties of bioactive ingredients of foods and herbs for the support of the human immune system against infections before discussing the possibility of COVID-19 transmission through the food chain. It also highlights the global food security issues arising from the fact that one-third of the world's population is on lockdown. Finally, it underlines the importance of sustainability in the food chain in order to avoid or reduce the frequency of relevant food and health crises in the future.
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	High throughput sequencing is currently re volutionizing the genomics field and 17 providing new approaches to the detection and characterization of microorganisms. The 18 objective of this study was to assess the detection of influenza D virus (IDV) in bovine 19 respiratory tract samples using two sequencing platforms (MiSeq and Nanopore 20 (GridION)), and species-specific qPCR. An IDV-specific qPCR was performed on 232 21 samples (116 nasal swabs and 116 tracheal washes) that had been previously subject to 22 virome sequencing using MiSeq. Nanopore sequencing was performed on 19 samples 23 positive for IDV by either MiSeq or qPCR. Nanopore sequence data was analyzed by two 24 bioinformatics methods: What's In My Pot (WIMP, on the EPI2ME platform), and an in-25 house developed analysis pipeline. The agreement of IDV detection between qPCR and 26 MiSeq was 82.3%, between qPCR and Nanopore was 57.9% (in-house) and 84.2% 27 (WIMP), and between MiSeq and Nanopore was 89.5% (in-house) and 73.7% (WIMP). 28 IDV was detected by MiSeq in 14 of 17 IDV qPCR-positive samples with Cq (cycle 29 quantification) values below 31, despite multiplexing 50 samples for sequencing. When 30 qPCR was regarded as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of MiSeq sequence 31 detection were 28.3% and 98.9%, respectively. We conclude that both MiSeq and 32 Nanopore sequencing are capable of detecting IDV in clinical specimens with a range of Cq 33 values. Sensitivity may be further improved by optimizing sequence data analysis, 34 improving virus enrichment, or reducing the degree of multiplexing. 35
f2342ccc43035a60a6f25a246232aaeb276151a8	Disinhibition, mainly caused by damage in frontotemporal brain regions, is one of the major causes of caregiver distress in neurodegenerative dementias. Behavioural inhibition deficits are usually described as a loss of social conduct and impulsivity, whereas cognitive inhibition deficits refer to impairments in the suppression of prepotent verbal responses and resistance to distractor interference. In this review, we aim to discuss inhibition deficits in neurodegenerative dementias through behavioural, cognitive, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological exploration. We also discuss impulsivity and compulsivity behaviours as related to disinhibition. We will therefore describe different tests available to assess both behavioural and cognitive disinhibition and summarise different manifestations of disinhibition across several neurodegenerative diseases (behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease). Finally, we will present the latest findings about structural, metabolic, functional, neurophysiological and also neuropathological correlates of inhibition impairments. We will briefly conclude by mentioning some of the latest pharmacological treatment options available for disinhibition. Within this framework, we aim to highlight i) the current interests and limits of tests and questionnaires available to assess behavioural and cognitive inhibition in clinical practice and in clinical research; ii) the interpretation of impulsivity and compulsivity within the spectrum of inhibition deficits; and iii) the brain regions and networks involved in such behaviours.

c8ed86b1b98baf40297c0dcac8c066f98dd7005c	The SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic that is causing a global health emergency. The lack of targeted therapeutics and limited treatment options have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or small molecule therapeutics against various targets of SARS-CoV-2. The main protease (Mpro) is a well characterized and attractive drug target because of its crucial role in processing of the polyproteins which are required for viral replication. In order to provide potential lead molecules against the Mpro for clinical use, we docked a set of 65 bioactive molecules of Tea plant followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of protein-ligand complexes by long term molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (1.50 ms). Top three bioactive molecules (Oolonghomobisflavan-A, Theasinensin-D, and Theaflavin-3-O-gallate) were selected by comparing their docking scores with repurposed drugs (Atazanavir, Darunavir, and Lopinavir) against SARS-CoV-2. Oolonghomobisflavan-A molecule showed a good number of hydrogen bonds with Mpro and higher MM-PBSA binding energy when compared to all three repurposed drug molecules. during the time of simulation. This study showed Oolonghomobisflavan-A as a potential bioactive molecule to act as an inhibitor for the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.
4dea1777dd4925aa3e6dd5b0400286cdad6eb5c0	A 64-year-old woman presented to the emergency department on February 1st, 2020, because of a 7-day fever, with the highest body temperature of 38.7 °C, accompanied by cough with a little sputum and muscle soreness, but no chest distress or dyspnea. She just flew back to Hangzhou, China, from Malaysia 7 days ago. Physical examination revealed no dry and moist rales in both lungs with a temperature of 37.3 °C, heart rate of 92 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 times/min, and blood pressure of 113/79 mmHg. Her laboratory tests showed white blood cell count (WBC) was 2.5 × 10 9 cells/mL with 63.3% neutrophils and 29.2% lymphocytes, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 3.62 mg/L. Her sputum test for influenza A + B (real-time fluorescent RT-PCR) was negative, and the lung CT images were shown in Fig. 1 . The lung CT images of this patient showed multiple ground-glass shadows with unclear edges and uneven densities in the peripheral and posterior lungs, mainly under the pleura. These imagings were in accordance with the early radiographic features of coronavirus disease 2019 . Later, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) RNA was detected in the sputum by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR, and the patient was diagnosed as COVID-19. A pneumonia of unknown etiology has spread rapidly all over the world since December 2019 [1]. In January 2020, the new virus was successfully isolated and sequenced [2], and then, the virus and corresponding disease were formally named the SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 has the characteristics of strong transmissibility, long disease course, and rapid exacerbation. This virus belongs to the Beta coronavirus genus, and its pathogenic mechanism has not been clarified, which need to be further studied. The diagnosis of pulmonary diseases mainly depends on the examination of etiology, and SARS-Cov-2 RNA detection is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Clinically, the lung CT imaging of patients with COVID-19 has unique characteristics [3] , which show multiple groundglass shadows and interstitial changes, mainly in the peripheral lungs at the early stage, and then multiple opaque infiltrates and pulmonary consolidations in both lungs, with rare pleural effusions. In this case, the patient was treated with patient isolation, antiviral drugs, small doses of glucocorticoids, and high-flow nasal oxygen therapy immediately. Then, she recovered uneventfully and was discharged on day 16.
f8c2f1a1903f8370c15b5be2e4d32e91f2641b03	Background: Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a disease that can result in huge economic losses in the poultry industry. The high level of mutations of the IB virus (IBV) leads to the emergence of new serotypes and genotypes, and limits the efficacy of routine prevention. Medicinal plants, or substances derived from them, are being tested as options in the prevention of infectious diseases such as IB in many countries. The objective of this study was to investigate extracts of 15 selected medicinal plants for anti-IBV activity. Results: Extracts of S. montana, O. vulgare, M. piperita, M. officinalis, T. vulgaris, H. officinalis, S. officinalis and D. canadense showed anti-IBV activity prior to and during infection, while S. montana showed activity prior to and after infection. M. piperita, O. vulgare and T. vulgaris extracts had > 60 SI. In further studies no virus plaques (plaque reduction rate 100%) or cytopathogenic effect (decrease of TCID 50 from 2.0 to 5.0 log 10 ) were detected after IBV treatment with extracts of M. piperita, D. canadense and T. vulgaris at concentrations of extracts ≥0.25 cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) (P < 0.05). Both PFU number and TCID 50 increased after the use of M. piperita, D. canadense, T. vulgaris and M. officinalis extracts, the concentrations of which were 0.125 CC 50 and 0.25 CC 50 (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR detected IBV RNA after treatment with all plant extracts using concentrations of 1:2 CC 50 , 1:4 CC 50 and 1:8 CC 50 . Delta cycle threshold (Ct) values decreased significantly comparing Ct values of 1:2 CC 50 and 1:8 CC 50 dilutions (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Many extracts of plants acted against IBV prior to and during infection, but the most effective were those of M. piperita, T. vulgaris and D. canadense .
6f1c0614f130ea518837a9cd78beeddca4165801	The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to disruptions in health care in the perinatal period and women's childbirth experiences. Organizations that represent health care professionals have responded with general practice guidelines for pregnant women, but limited attention has been devoted to mental health in the perinatal period during a pandemic. Evidence suggests that in this context, significant psychological distress may have the potential for longterm psychological harm for mothers and infants. For infants, this risk may extend into early childhood. In this commentary, we present recommendations for practice, research, and policy related to mental health in the perinatal period. These recommendations include the use of a trauma-informed framework to promote social support and infant attachment, use of technology and telehealth, and assessment for mental health needs and experiences of violence.
a5461ce95a584cf5eb9352e70ea68d14e619a41e	Introduction: The role of laboratory parameters in screening of COVID-19 cases has not been definitely established. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test. They can help in detection of COVID-19 patients.
09b1afa1b6bc043468461b28700c0272eaedc96d	Transportation investment continues to grow in aid of economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability worldwide, but limited empirical research has been conducted on the changing value of highway investment in deindustrializing economies. This study examines the influences of highway proximity and traffic on office values in Hong Kong using hedonic price analysis on 13,670 transactions around highway interchanges for 2002-2013. Our hedonic regressions, controlling for unobservable district effects and incorporating instrumental variables, reveal that the associations of highway proximity and traffic with office prices appear to exhibit mixed results across Hong Kong's three territorial divisions. The negative externalities generated by excess traffic cancel out the accessibility benefits of highway proximity on Hong Kong Island, where densely built-up office districts are suited for amenity-sensitive knowledge businesses that tend to create value-added services through face-to-face communications. By contrast, highway proximity uplifts the value of office properties with lower transportation costs and higher market accessibility in Kowloon and the New Territories, where spacious workplaces near hub-port and logistics facilities are advantageous for mobility-driven trade and transportation businesses that tend to increase value-added throughput in cross-border relations with mainland China. These territorial findings are of particular importance for progressive policymakers to deploy the strategic applications of underground bypasses, greenway creation, interchange improvement, congestion charges, and smart technology to manage mobility and alleviate disamenity, accompanied by supportive public transit services and adaptive land-use rezoning, in the dynamic and complex process of deindustrialization.
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	In previous work, we demonstrated that the arenavirus Junín virus (JUNV) is able to activate Akt by means of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) survival pathway during virus entry. This work extends our study, emphasizing the relevance of this pathway in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection in vitro. During the course of infection, JUNV-infected Vero cells showed a typical cytopathic effect that may be ascribed to apoptotic cell death. Treatment of infected cultures with Ly294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, produced an apoptotic response similar to that observed for uninfected cells treated with the drug. This result suggests that virus-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway does not deliver a strong enough anti-apoptotic signal to explain the low proportion of apoptotic cells observed during infection. Also, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway during the acute stage of infection did not prevent the establishment of persistence. Furthermore, treatment of persistently JUNVinfected cells with Ly294002 did not alter viral protein expression. These findings indicate that despite the positive modulation of the PI3/Akt pathway during Junín virus entry, this would not play a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of JUNV persistence in Vero cells.
20029dc39eb2b7cd0a8392445e6596f93933258a	There have been many attempts to isolate infectious agents from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and many viruses have been incriminated at one time or another over the past few decades. However, in every case further research has disproved the original claim. Thus, we cautiously report on the isolation of four antigenically related agents from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of three patients with MS and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The patients yielding the isolates from their CSF possessed neutralizing antibodies to the virus in their blood, in contrast to several other virus-free patients with chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases studied at the same time. The virus could not be isolated from 27 patients who were not suffering from chronic disease of the CNS. The agent has not yet been adequately Address reprint requests to: Dr.
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	This study was to determine if feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected and uninfected Crandall feline kidney (CRFK) cells exhibited a low temperature (16~ block in membrane trafficking between transitional endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus represented by intermediate compartment formation. Ceils were cultured at different temperatures and membrane changes involving the Golgi apparatus and Golgi apparatus-associated membrane structures were monitored by electron microscopy and quantitated. With 30 min of incubation, membranes of the Golgi apparatus stack increased in amount at temperatures of 16 ~ and below compared to temperatures above 18 ~ The increase was greatest along the major polarity axis as evidenced by an increased stack height. Neither the number of cisternae per stack nor the average stack diameter (width) was affected by temperature. The response was maximal between 15 and 30 rain of low temperature treatment of the cells. Results with cells infected and uninfected with feline immunodeficiency virus were similar. The increase in stack height was due primarily to an increase of membranes at the cis face (cis Golgi apparatus network). At 18 ~ membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus network accumulated suggesting that import from the cis Golgi network could proceed at this temperature, whereas exit from the trans Golgi network was still at least partially blocked. Also increased at 16 ~ and below were numbers of transition vesicles in the space between the Golgi apparatus and the transitional endoplasmic reticulum associated with the cis Golgi apparatus face. The results suggested interruption of the orderly flux of membranes into the Golgi apparatus at 16~ and below. Moreover, the block appeared to be reversible. Upon transfer from 16~ to 37~ there was a time-dependent decrease in the accumulations of cis compartment membrane accompanied by a corresponding equivalent increase in the membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus compartment.
97573bdfc3c350c86a74c95ea11e773fbb12786b	The global boom in premature mortality and morbidity from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) shares many similarities with pandemics of infectious diseases, yet public health professionals have resisted the adoption of this label. It is increasingly apparent that NCDs are actually communicable conditions, and although the vectors of disease are nontraditional, the pandemic label is apt. Arguing for a change in terminology extends beyond pedantry as the move carries serious implications for the public health community and the general public. Additional resources are unlocked once a disease reaches pandemic proportions and, as a long-neglected and underfunded group of conditions, NCDs desperately require a renewed sense of focus and political attention. This paper provides objections, definitions, and advantages to approaching the leading cause of global death through an alternative lens. A novel framework for managing NCDs is presented with reference to the traditional influenza pandemic response.
3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	Background: Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs have shown to reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and health-care-associated infections (HAIs), and save health-care costs associated with an inappropriate antimicrobial use. The primary objective of this study was to compare the consumption and cost of antimicrobial agents using defined daily dose (DDD) and direct cost of antibiotics before and after the AMS program implementation. Secondary objective was to determine the rate of HAIs [Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) before and after the AMS program implementation. Methods: This is a pre-post quasi-experimental study. Adult inpatients were enrolled in a prospective fashion under the active AMS arm and compared with historical inpatients who were admitted to the same units before the AMS implementation. Study was conducted at four tertiary private hospitals located in two cities in Saudi Arabia. Adult inpatients were enrolled under the pre-AMS arm and post-AMS arm if they were on any of the ten selected restricted broad-spectrum antibiotics (imipenem/cilastatin, piperacillin/tazobactam, colistin, tigecycline, cefepime, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, teicoplanin and linezolid). Results: A total of 409,403 subjects were recruited, 79,369 in the pre-AMS control and 330,034 in the post-AMS arm. Average DDDs consumption of all targeted broad-spectrum antimicrobials from January 2016 to June 2019 post-AMS launch was lower than the DDDs use of these agents pre-AMS (233 vs 320 DDDs per 1000 patient-days, p = 0.689). Antimicrobial expenditures decreased by 28.45% in the first year of the program and remained relatively stable in subsequent years, with overall cumulative cost savings estimated at S.R. 6,286,929 and negligible expenses of S.R. 505,115 (p = 0.648). Rates of healthcare associated infections involving C. difficile, VAP, and CLABSI all decreased significantly after AMS implementation (incidence of HAIs in 2015 compared to 2019: for C. difficile, 94 vs 13, p = 0.024; for VAP, 24 vs 6, p = 0.001; for CLABSI, 17 vs 1, p = 0.000; respectively). Conclusion: Implementation of AMS program at HMG healthcare facilities resulted in reduced antimicrobials use and cost, and lowered incidence of healthcare associated infections.
ca74e3e16db2a4bb2580371a8ede45334edcb157	A 60 year-old man born in Central America died suddenly in the hallway of his residence on the grounds of a resort hotel where he worked as a dishwasher. The dishwashing station was in a large, poorly ventilated area where a substantial number of food service workers (cooks, wait staff, bus persons, dishwashers, supervisors, etc.) shared air space with the index patient. Several social contacts of the patient reported that he had been coughing for many months before his death. The County Department Of Health conducted a contact investigation, which identified 171 individuals in need of follow-up. Thirty-six percent of those tested in the first round were tuberculin skin test-positive; a second round of testing yielded a 15% (8 of 52) conversion rate. (Heart Lung® 2004;33:333-7.) From
597252f9c641dc8db56ba4132d0edcbff9c50ee6	In this study, a novel circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding single stranded (CRESS) DNA virus was discovered in diarrheic sample of a calf with severe hemorrhagic enteritis. The virus, named Bo-Circo-like virus CH, has a circular genome with 3909 nucleotides (nt). Six putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, including Rep, capsid (Cap) and four proteins of unknown function. Both the genome size and the number as well as the organization of encoded ORFs, Bo-Circo-like virus CH is most closely related to Po-Circolike virus 21 detected in pig faeces. A preliminary survey using specific primers for the Rep region showed that 5.3% (4/75) of diarrheic samples were positive for Bo-Circo-like virus, and all 42 healthy samples were negative. In conclusion, our results indicate that Bo-Circo-like virus CH may represent a new virus in bovine. Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between the virus infection and diarrhea.
cf413613e336f7313a66ebffc216e1cb6f98ca8b	The efficient synthesis of a new series of acyclonucleotide analogues with a 1,2,3-triazole linker is described starting from diethyl azidomethyl-, 2-azidoethyl-, 3-azidopropyl-, 4-azidobutyl-, 2-azido-1hydroxyethyl-, 3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl-and 3-azido-1-hydroxypropylphosphonates and selected alkynes under microwave irradiation. Several O,O-diethylphosphonate acyclonucleotides were transformed into the respective phosphonic acids. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for activity against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses and cytostatic activity against murine leukaemia L1210, human Tlymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. Acyclonucleotide 22e exhibited activity against both herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) in HEL cell cultures (EC 50 ¼ 17 mM) and feline herpes virus (EC 50 ¼ 24 mM) in CRFK cell cultures, while compounds 20k, 21k, 22k and 23k preferentially inhibited proliferation of human T-lymphocyte CEM cells at IC 50 in the 2.8e12 mM range. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Fig. 3. Nucleoside analogues having natural nucleobases connected to the 1,2,3-triazole ring by a methylene linker. I.E. Głowacka et al. / European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 70 (2013) 703e722 704 Conformational preferences of phosphonates described in this paper were ascertained by analyses of 1 H, 1 H{ 31 P} and 13 C NMR spectra. Since all vicinal protoneproton couplings within the H 2 Ce CH 2 fragment in phosphonates 21eel were observed around 7 Hz, it was concluded that the rotation around the PCH 2 eCH 2 N bond is fully unrestricted. On the other hand, based on the values of 3 J H1e H2a ¼ 10.0 Hz, 3 J H1eH2b ¼ 2.9 Hz [83] and small values of 3 J PeH2a and 3 J PeH2b (ca. 5.5 Hz) [84, 85] one may deduce that phosphonates 24eel exist in the antiperiplanar conformation 34 which is probably stabilised by the intramolecular hydrogen bond (Fig. 5) . Conformational behaviour of the three-carbon linkers between the diethoxyphosphoryl and substituted 1,2,3-triazole groups in phosphonates 22eel, 25eel and 26eel is primarily governed by the presence of the hydroxy groups. Thus, values of vicinal protone proton couplings within PCH 2 eCH 2 and CH 2 eCH 2 N subunits in 22eel (ca. 7 Hz) can only be observed when free rotation around these bonds is allowed. 2-Hydroxyphosphonates 25eel adopt the H-bond stabilised antiperiplanar conformation 35 along the PCH 2 e CH bond [ 3 J H1aeH2 ¼ 3.9 Hz, 3 J H1beH2 ¼ 8.6 Hz, 3 J PeH2 ¼ 12.0 and 3 J Pe , while the rotation around the CHeCH 2 N bond is unrestricted [ 3 J H2eH3a ¼ 3.0 Hz, 3 J H2eH3b ¼ 7.0 Hz]. To establish a conformational behaviour of 1-hydroxyphosphonates 26ael the extensive NMR studies on 1-hydroxyphosphonate 26i were conducted at 600 MHz. From the values of 3 J H1eH2a ¼ 3.3 Hz, 3 J H1eH2b ¼ 10.9 Hz as well as 3 J PeH2a ¼ 6.1 and 3 J PeH2b ¼ 6.4, 3 J Pe C3 ¼ 15e18 Hz, it is evident that along the PCHeCH 2 bond, this phosphonate exists in the antiperiplanar conformation 36, while based on the values of 3 J H2aeH3a ¼ 3 J H2aeH3b ¼ 8.0 Hz, 3 J H2be H3a ¼ 5.9 Hz and 3 J H2beH3b ¼ 5.9 Hz one may suggest that along the CH 2 eCH 2 N bond in 26i the rotation is almost free. The anticipated full conformational freedom along the tetramethylene linker in the butylphosphonates 23ael is confirmed by the values of 3 J HeH ¼ 7.1 Hz between all methylene groups (Fig. 5) .

e9c8c9036e9dd48230c81ff006be5fceba73660f	We report a young girl who died of Streptococcus pneumoniae 19A pneumonia, septic shock, and hemolytic uremic syndrome despite prior pneumococcal vaccination, appropriate antibiotics, and aggressive intensive care support. Serotype 19A is not covered by the 7-or 10-valent pneumococcal vaccines. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and metapneumovirus were simultaneously detected by PCR in the nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates. The pneumococcus is penicillin sensitive. Although infections with each of these pathogens alone are typically mild, this case highlights that co-infection with the triple respiratory pathogens possibly contributed to the fatal outcome of this child. Also, the new policy in Hong Kong to use PCV13 may help prevent further cases of serotype 19A infections.
b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	Mouse hepatitis virus persists in cultures of a subline (designated LM-K) of mouse LM cells but produces a lytic infection in L-2 cells. Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of ts mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virusinduced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.
7d249d30e5fed3a63e86f598a24e5beeae5317ac	Motivated by the current COVID-19 health-crisis, we examine the task of baseline subtraction for quantitative polymerase chain-reaction (qPCR) measurements. In particular, we present an algorithm that leverages information obtained from non-template and/or DNA extraction-control experiments to remove systematic bias from amplification curves. We recast this problem in terms of mathematical optimization, i.e. by finding the amount of control signal that, when subtracted from an amplification curve, minimizes background noise. We demonstrate that this approach can yield a decade improvement in sensitivity relative to standard approaches, especially for data exhibiting late-cycle amplification. Critically, this increased sensitivity and accuracy promises more effective screening of viral DNA and a reduction in the rate of false-negatives in diagnostic settings.
a2ce11bc2aecd4381aa82ca33ca6f32792b99f17	Background. Persons with influenza can develop complications that result in hospitalization and death. These are most commonly respiratory related, but cardiovascular or neurologic complications or exacerbations of underlying chronic medical conditions may also occur. Patterns of complications observed during pandemics may differ from typical influenza seasons, and characterizing variations in influenza-related complications can provide a better understanding of the impact of pandemics and guide appropriate clinical management and planning for the future. Methods. Using a population-based surveillance system, we compared clinical complications using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis codes in adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza (n = 5270) or 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (H1N1pdm09; n = 4962). Results. Adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were younger (median age, 47 years) than those with seasonal influenza (median age, 68 years; P < .01), and differed in the frequency of certain underlying medical conditions. Whereas there was similar risk for many influenza-associated complications, after controlling for age and type of underlying medical condition, adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were more likely to have lower respiratory tract complications, shock/sepsis, and organ failure than those with seasonal influenza. They were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation, or die. Young adults, in particular, had 2-4 times the risk of severe outcomes from H1N1pdm09 than persons of the same ages with seasonal influenza. Conclusions. Although H1N1pdm09 was thought of as a relatively mild pandemic, these data highlight the impact of the 2009 pandemic on the risk of severe influenza, especially among younger adults, and the impact this virus may continue to have.
6af0a3821669f8450d8e8dad3e2e1d3750fb1aec	A series of novel acyl-hydrazone (4a-d) and spirothiazolidinone (5a-d, 6a-d) derivatives of imidazo[2,1-b] thiazole were synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral and antimycobacterial activity. The antituberculosis activity was evaluated by using the Microplate Alamar Blue Assay and the antiviral activity was evaluated against diverse viruses in mammalian cell cultures. According to the biological activity studies of the compounds, 5a-c displayed hope promising antitubercular activity, 6d was found as potent for Coxsackie B4 virus, 5d was found as effective against Feline corona and Feline herpes viruses. Consequently, the obtained results displayed that, 5a-d and 6d present a leading structure for future drug development due to its straightforward synthesis and relevant bioactivity.
9c2a5b7a0468f906b4ace4878e27a05e3d723bdd	Constant search for new drugs with antiviral properties often extends to products of natural origin. Lamiaceae is one of the most important herbal families, well known for various biological and medicinal effects of a variety of aromatic spices, including thyme, mint, oregano, basil, sage, savory, rosemary, selfheal, hyssop, lemon balm and many others. The paper provides a review of antiviral potential of previously mentioned plants which has been demonstrated so far, with special emphasis on anti-HIV properties. Relevant articles were compiled by searching plant names combined with keywords describing antiviral activity. The antiviral effect is direct, with prominent activity against enveloped viral species. Initial stages of the viral life cycle are the most affected, as these plants appear to be targeting mainly viral structures responsible for attachment to target cells. In case of HIV, there is some activity against key enzymes in the viral life cycle. Even in the case of drug resistance, there is an equal susceptibility to applied herbal preparations. Some in vivo experiments suggest that use of Lamiaceae representatives could help in prevention and treatment of some viral diseases. A possible reduction of side effects of diseases and conventional drug therapy are also some aspects worth further investigations.
9caf8889b67210b62b9738b3d4e801d15bcca4f6	Background: Surrogate decision makers of stroke patients are often unprepared to make critical decisions on lifesustaining treatments. We describe the development process and key features for the Understanding Stroke webbased decision support tool. Methods: We used multiple strategies to develop a patient-centered, tailored decision aid. We began by forming a Patient and Family Advisory Council to provide continuous input to our multidisciplinary team on the development of the tool. Additionally, focus groups consisting of nurses, therapists, social workers, physicians, stroke survivors, and family members reviewed key elements of the tool, including prognostic information, graphical displays, and values clarification exercise. To design the values clarification exercise, we asked focus groups to provide feedback on a list of important activities of daily living. An ordinal prognostic model was developed for ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage using data taken from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive Plus, and incorporated into the tool. Results: Focus group participants recommended making numeric prognostic information optional due to possible emotional distress. Pie charts were generally favored by participants for graphical presentation of prognostic information, though a horizontal stacked bar chart was also added due to its prevalence in stroke literature. Plain language descriptions of the modified Rankin Scale were created to accompany the prognostic information. A values clarification exercise was developed consisting of a list of 13 situations that may make an individual consider comfort measures only. The final version of the web based tool (which can be viewed on tablets) included the following sections: general introduction to stroke, outcomes (prognostic information and recovery), in-hospital and life-sustaining treatments, decision making and values clarification, post-hospital care, tips for talking to the health care team, and a summary report. Preliminary usability testing received generally favorable feedback. (Continued on next page)
e620067ec156a1fc9e5b28aaf66b38dd08815df8	Feline foamy virus (FFV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) belong to the Retroviridae family. While disease has not been reported for FFV infection, FeLV infection can cause anemia and immunosuppression (progressive infection). Co-infection with FFV/FeLV allows evaluation of the pathogenic potential and epidemiology of FFV infection in cats with FeLV pathology. Blood and buccal swab samples from 81 cats were collected in Rio de Janeiro. Plasma was serologically tested for FeLV. DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal swabs was used to PCR detect FFV and FeLV. A qPCR was developed to detect and measure FFV proviral loads (pVLs) in cats. FeLV qPCR was performed using previous methods. The median log10 pVL of FFV mono-infected individuals was lower than found in FFV/FeLV co-infected cats in buccal swabs (p = 0.003). We found 78% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA in FFV mono-infected and FFV co-infected FeLV-progressive cats, while in FeLV-regressive cats (those without signs of disease) 22% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA (p = 0.004). Our results suggest that regressive FeLV infection may reduce FFV saliva transmission, the main mode of FV transmission. We did not find evidence of differences in pathogenicity in FFV mono-and -dually infected cats. In summary, we show that FVs may interact with FeLV within the same host. Our study supports the utility of cats naturally co-infected with retroviruses as a model to investigate the impact of FV on immunocompromised mammalian hosts.
708c7079f4e87f68e5dd16510b360d6d078986e6	Background COVID-19 has created an urgent need for reorganization and surge planning among departments of surgery across the USA. Methods Review of the COVID-19 planning process and work products in preparation for a patient surge. Organizational and process changes, workflow redesign, and communication plans are presented. Results The planning process included widespread collaboration among leadership from many disciplines. The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning. A clear communication plan should be implemented early and input from trainees, staff, and faculty should be solicited. Conclusion Major departmental and health system reorganization is required to adapt academic surgical practices to a widespread crisis. Surgical leadership, innovation, and flexibility are critical to successful planning and implementation.
5a335444e8cf2bb365519d60ce2b9b4c0da7f514	The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the presence of viral RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in conjunctival swab specimen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with and without conjunctivitis to establish the diagnostic value of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in each case and to describe its clinical characteristics. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos of Madrid, Spain. Thirty-six subjects from the COVID admission unit with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Conjunctival swabs were collected from 18 patients with conjunctivitis and 18 patients without conjunctivitis and RT-PCR was performed. Conjunctival swab was collected from both eyes of 36 patients (72 eyes), detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conjunctival swab of two patients (5.5%). Among the 18 patients with conjunctivitis, only one of them (5.5%) showed positive results. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one patient without conjunctivitis (5.5%). The mean age of the 36 patients was 67.9 years (range, 28-92 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 0.44 (16:20). The mean days since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms until conjunctivitis manifestation was 8 (range, 1-24 days). The mean duration of the conjunctivitis was 3 days (range, 1-7 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected in conjunctival swabs of both patients with and without conjunctivitis. This study revealed the same rate of positive results amongst the group with and without conjunctivitis, suggesting that detecting SARS-CoV-2 in ocular fluids is not conditioned on the presence of conjunctivitis. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ocular samples highlights the role of the eye as a possible route of transmission of the disease. K E Y W O R D S conjunctivitis, coronavirus, COVID, diagnosis, PCR
a3bfaaf674b65c60a1cb4542c7ec59d66da7a6a6	KEYWORDS Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV Epidemiology diagnosis Treatment The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a novel lethal zoonotic disease of humans endemic to The Middle East, caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Humans are thought to acquire MERS-CoV though contact with camels or camel products. MERS carries a 35% mortality rate. There is no specific treatment for MERS. Person-toperson spread causes hospital and household outbreaks of MERS-CoV. Millions of visitors travel to Saudi Arabia each year from across the world, thus watchful surveillance and a high degree of clinical awareness and early diagnosis with rapid implementation of infection control measures in returning travelers is important.

We agree that UV irradiation is an acceptable approach for surgical mask decontamination. Reuse of masks is not ideal and should be reserved for situations in which there is no alternative.
5bb8f28608aad3bde8b470c81025ce3c9e3a5fc3	The 2009 pandemic influenza virus caused the majority of the influenza A virus infections in China in 2009. It arrived in several Chinese cities from imported cases and then spread as people travelled domestically by all means of transportation, among which road traffic was the most commonly used for daily commuting. Spatial variation in socioeconomic status not only accelerates migration across regions but also partly induces the differences in epidemic processes and in responses to epidemics across regions. However, the roles of both road travel and socioeconomic factors have not received the attention they deserve. Here, we constructed a national highway network for and between 333 cities in mainland China and extracted epidemiological variables and socioeconomic factors for each city. We calculated classic centrality measures for each city in the network and proposed two new measures (SumRatio and Multicenter Distance). We evaluated the correlation between the centrality measures and epidemiological features and conducted a spatial autoregression to quantify the impacts of road network and socioeconomic factors during the outbreak. The results showed that epidemics had more significant relationships with both our new measures than the classic ones. Higher population density, higher per person income, larger SumRatio and Multicenter Distance, more hospitals and college students, and lower per person GDP were associated with higher cumulative incidence. Higher population density and number of slaughtered pigs were found to advance epidemic arrival time. Higher population density, more colleges and slaughtered pigs, and lower Multicenter Distance were associated with longer epidemic duration. In conclusion, road transport and socioeconomic status had significant impacts and should be considered for the prevention and control of future pandemics.
d9cd10250bab75a881cb23146ea83b8dee7bb302	Adenovirus infections in humans are common and sometimes lethal. Adenovirus-derived vectors are also commonly chosen for gene therapy in human clinical trials. We have shown in previous work that homologous recombination between adenoviral genomes of human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), the largest and fastest growing HAdV species, is responsible for the rapid evolution of this species. Because adenovirus infection initiates in mucosal epithelia, particularly at the gastrointestinal, respiratory, genitourinary, and ocular surfaces, we sought to determine a possible role for mucosal microbiota in adenovirus genome diversity. By analysis of known recombination hot spots across 38 human adenovirus genomes in species D (HAdV-D), we identified nucleotide sequence motifs similar to bacterial Chi sequences, which facilitate homologous recombination in the presence of bacterial Rec enzymes. These motifs, referred to here as Chi AD , were identified immediately 5= to the sequence encoding penton base hypervariable loop 2, which expresses the arginine-glycine-aspartate moiety critical to adenoviral cellular entry. Coinfection with two HAdV-Ds in the presence of an Escherichia coli lysate increased recombination; this was blocked in a RecA mutant strain, E. coli DH5␣, or upon RecA depletion. Recombination increased in the presence of E. coli lysate despite a general reduction in viral replication. RecA colocalized with viral DNA in HAdV-D-infected cell nuclei and was shown to bind specifically to Chi AD sequences. These results indicate that adenoviruses may repurpose bacterial recombination machinery, a sharing of evolutionary mechanisms across a diverse microbiota, and unique example of viral commensalism. IMPORTANCE Adenoviruses are common human mucosal pathogens of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and ocular surface. Here, we report finding Chi-like sequences in adenovirus recombination hot spots. Adenovirus coinfection in the presence of bacterial RecA protein facilitated homologous recombination between viruses. Genetic recombination led to evolution of an important external feature on the adenoviral capsid, namely, the penton base protein hypervariable loop 2, which contains the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid motif critical to viral internalization. We speculate that free Rec proteins present in gastrointestinal secretions upon bacterial cell death facilitate the evolution of human adenoviruses through homologous recombination, an example of viral commensalism and the complexity of virus-host interactions, including regional microbiota.
50e17f27f637be919c8a1d4bc8c40c864fef75c1	Objective The purpose of this article was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the diagnostic test accuracy of chest CT for detecting coronavirus disease 2019 . Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched up to March 12, 2020. We included studies providing information regarding diagnostic test accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 detection. The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled. Results Sixteen studies (n = 3186 patients) were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate in general. Pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI = 86-96%), and two studies reported specificity (25% [95% CI = 22-30%] and 33% [95% CI = 23-44%], respectively). There was substantial heterogeneity according to Cochran's Q test (p < 0.01) and Higgins I 2 heterogeneity index (96% for sensitivity). After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively). In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%. Conclusion Chest CT offers the great sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic situation. However, the specificity is low. In the context of emergency disease control, chest CT provides a fast, convenient, and effective method to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic. • Chest CT has a high sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic, which is helpful to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.
8a076c2bdec90e5de52eb3b8bd79e02bb8cd8799	The novel coronavirus-2019 disease pandemic has had devastating consequences on healthcare systems globally. The effect this has on urologists and the patients they care for is not fully understood and presents the challenge of prioritizing the most urgent cases. We aim to review the impact on urology services and evaluate strategies to minimize disruption. Various healthcare systems have been forced to postpone treatment for many urological conditions as resources are dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19. Training has been postponed as staff are reallocated to areas of need. Face-to-face contact is largely minimized and innovative, virtual communication methods are used in the outpatient setting and multidisciplinary team meetings. Surgical practice is changing because of the risks posed by COVID-19 and procedures can be prioritized in a nonurgent, low priority, high priority or emergency category. Although the COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably affect urological services, steps can be taken to mitigate the impact and prioritize the patients most in need of urgent care. Similarly, in future; simulation, e-learning and webinars will allow interaction to share, discuss and debate focused training and education.

48e1e9b726076108125aa7500c2e4588fa19c959	Purpose of Review Patients diagnosed with head and neck (H&N) cancer often present in a malnourished state for varied reasons; nutritional optimization is therefore critical to the success of treatment for these complex patients. This article aims to review the current nutrition literature pertaining to H&N cancer patients and to present evidencebased strategies for nutritional support specific to this population. Recent Findings Aggressive nutritional intervention is frequently required in the H&N cancer patient population. Rehabilitating nutrition during operative and nonoperative treatment improves compliance with treatment, quality of life, and clinical outcomes. When and whether to establishing alternative enteral access are points of controversy, although recent evidence suggests prophylactic enteral feeding tube placement should not be universally applied. Perioperative nutritional optimization including preoperative carbohydrate loading and provision of arginine-supplemented immunonutrition has been shown to benefit atrisk H&N cancer patients. Summary With multidisciplinary collaboration, H&N cancer patients can receive individualized nutritional support to withstand difficult cancer treatment regimens and return to acceptable states of nutritional health.
21d19c09d38d83036d23288d2f7c0ea8dc2ede13	In situ hybridization (ISH) is a useful diagnostic and research tool, but is also time consuming. This study was conducted to determine if a rate enhancement hybridization (REH) buffer, developed for membrane hybridization, could be used to decrease hybridization time for ISH. Tissue from swine with an enteric disease produced by a swine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was used as a model to standardize hybridization conditions for a rapid ISH technique. Small intestinal sections from pigs experimentally and naturally infected with TGEV were hybridized for various times at 52°C and 70°C with a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled RNA probe in a standard hybridization or a REH buffer. Viral RNA was detected in intestines from as early as 30 min of hybridization by using both buffers with the radiolabelled probe; however, the signal was stronger with the REH buffer. With the fluorescein-labelled probe, viral RNA was detected in virus-infected cells of the intestines after 30 min of hybridization by using the REH buffer. Signal intensity was greater with the REH buffer than with the standard hybridization buffer when compared at each hybridization time and hybridization temperature using both radiolabelled and fluorescein-labelled probes. With the REH buffer, hybridization signal intensity was greater at 70°C than at 52°C for both probes. The best results were obtained when small intestinal sections were hybridized at 70°C for 2 h using a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled probe diluted in the REH buffer. The fluorescein-labelled RNA probe with REH buffer resulted in a minimal non-specific signal when compared with the radiolabelled probe. These studies demonstrated that the REH buffer can be used to decrease the time of ISH for the detection of viral RNA. This rapid ISH technique should have broad applications in the utilization of probe technology in diagnostics and research for the detection of target ribonucleic acids in situ.
3912b80014bfe289bdb7ca30d6ce8c1200e393cb	As the world continues to deal with climate-induced heat events, sustainable energy behaviours, or lifestyles combined with non-behavioural interventions have been identified as crucial pathways to curb the demand for air conditioners. Typically, ecological communities serve as a reference point for sustainable lifestyles as they have strong environmental self-identity and values and are more likely to further engage in pro-environmental and energy-saving actions. Yet, it is unknown if individuals within these communities will act as expected, especially when confronted with extreme climatic challenges like heatwaves. It is also unclear which factors will define individual responses to these challenges. Utilising environmental self-identity and Value-Belief-Norm theories, this paper examines factors underlying cooling consumption behaviours of households living in a Universal Community with strong environmental world views in India. Twenty in-depth qualitative interviews with residents, thematically analysed, found that while people expressed strong environmental self-identity, preferences for air conditioner use was often mediated by hedonic factors such as comfort and sleep. Moral norms played a positive role in how people operated their air conditioners. Yet, when faced with the choice of using energy-efficient air conditioners, biospheric concern was of limited importance while situational factors like cost and functionality were more pivotal. The above results raise interesting questions around the difficulties that might emerge in changing preferences around air conditioning behaviours in non-environmental communities, especially, if environmentally conscious communities which are expected to be "the locus of change for energy efficiency actions" are significantly influenced by hedonic values.
6ac345a594c2c044fe174c9c1ddd78a8b655b225	This article takes as its starting point the idea that re-emerging infectious disease has become a paradigmatic way of thinking about disease. The framing of infectious disease as a threat to global public health and economic security coincides with preemptive forms of control. A particular type of preemptive regulation is global pandemic influenza planning that entails the governing of an imminent, albeit uncertain, global health event. We examine the discourse of 'preparedness' within pandemic planning documents produced by the World Health Organization from 1999 to 2009. We present key findings on: the construction of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform and expand across corporeal and territorial boundaries; and the integration of pandemic preparedness into everyday practices. Our analysis illustrates how the discourse of preparedness links the justification for population-level preemptive approaches to discursive constructions of the virus. By articulating this relationship, this article contributes to understandings of the implications of 'molecular' constructions for the biopolitical regulation of the global population.
dd9f7117ce3bc1640a5c01b2371bdd47912dce85	Dengue virus, an RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, affects 50 million individuals annually, and approximately 500,000-1,000,000 of these infections lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. With no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral treatments available to prevent dengue infection, dengue is considered a major public health problem in subtropical and tropical regions. The virus, like other enveloped viruses, uses the host's cellular enzymes to synthesize its structural (C, E, and prM/M) and nonstructural proteins (NS1-5) and, subsequently, to glycosylate these proteins to produce complete and functional glycoproteins. The structural glycoproteins, specifically the E protein, are known to interact with the host's carbohydrate receptors through the viral proteins' N-glycosylation sites and thus mediate the viral invasion of cells. This review focuses on the involvement of dengue glycoproteins in the course of infection and the virus' exploitation of the host's glycans, especially the interactions between host receptors and carbohydrate moieties. We also discuss the recent developments in antiviral therapies that target these processes and interactions, focusing specifically on the use of carbohydrate-binding agents derived from plants, commonly known as lectins, to inhibit the progression of infection. & Fakhriedzwan Idris
e4f893860d08836c6567ad6c00a2a3ecd6adcc5f	Despite being a leading cause of severe respiratory disease, there remains no licensed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease, but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection. In contrast, the role of memory CD8 T cells in protecting against a secondary RSV infection is less established. We recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following RSV infection, but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by IFN-γ. To evaluate the ability of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology, mice with high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to RSV challenge. Neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following RSV challenge compared with IgG-treated controls. Neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication, which caused a substantial reduction in memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-γ production, directly resulting in survival. In contrast, therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity, mortality, or IFN-γ levels, despite significantly reducing lung viral titers. Therefore, only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection. Overall, our results have important implications for the development of future RSV vaccines. Mucosal Immunology (2020) 13:507-517; https://doi.

(n = 457), and one each from ACON Laboratories (n = 200); and SD BIOSENSOR (n = 155)]. In a cohort of primarily hospitalized, RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases, sensitivity at ≥ 14 days from symptom onset was: BTNX kit 1, 95%; BTNX kit 2, 91%; ACON, 95%; and SD, 92%. All assays showed good concordance with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay at ≥ 14 days from symptom onset: BTNX kit 1, 99%; BTNX kit 2, 94%; ACON, 99%; and SD, 100%. Specificity, measured using specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the US and "cross-reactivity challenge" specimens, was 98% for BTNX kit 1 and ACON and 100% for BTNX kit 2 and SD. These results suggest that LFIAs may provide adequate results for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2.
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	, is an infectious disease found worldwide. Children infected with MTB are more likely to progress to active TB (ATB); however, the molecular mechanism behind this process has long been a mystery. We employed the label-free quantitative proteomic technology to identify and characterize differences in plasma proteins between ATB and latent TB infection (LTBI) in children. To detect differences that are indicative of MTB infection, we first selected proteins whose expressions were markedly different between the ATB and LTBI groups and the control groups (inflammatory disease control (IDC) and healthy control (HC) groups). A total of 521 proteins differed (> 1.5-fold or < 0.6-fold) in the LTBI group, and 318 proteins in the ATB group when compared with the control groups. Of these, 49 overlapping proteins were differentially expressed between LTBI and ATB. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed most proteins had a cellular and organelle distribution. The MTB infection status was mainly related to differences in binding, cellular and metabolic processes. XRCC4, PCF11, SEMA4A and ATP11A were selected and further verified by qPCR and western blot. At the mRNA level, the expression of XRCC4, PCF11and SEMA4A presented an increased trend in ATB group compare with LTBI. At the protein level, the expression of all these proteins by western blot in ATB/LTBI was consistent with the trends from proteomic detection. Our results provide important data for future mechanism studies and biomarker selection for MTB infection in children.
b01edd6c71207f4ab7f514a7e39267ee2eb8d029	To identify environmental sites commonly contaminated by avian infl uenza virus A (H5N1) in live-bird markets in Indonesia, we investigated 83 markets in 3 provinces in Indonesia. At each market, samples were collected from up to 27 poultry-related sites to assess the extent of contamination. Samples were tested by using real-time reverse transcription-PCR and virus isolation. A questionnaire was used to ascertain types of birds in the market, general infrastructure, and work practices. Thirty-nine (47%) markets showed contamination with avian infl uenza virus in >1 of the sites sampled. Risk factors were slaughtering birds in the market and being located in West Java province. Protective factors included daily removal of waste and zoning that segregated poultry-related work fl ow areas. These results can aid in the design of evidence-based programs concerning environmental sanitation, food safety, and surveillance to reduce the risk for avian infl uenza virus A (H5N1) transmission in live-bird markets.

2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged. To date, more than 2300 cases have been reported, with an approximate case fatality rate of 35%. Epidemiological investigations identified dromedary camels as the source of MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission and evidence of MERS-CoV circulation has been observed throughout the original range of distribution. Other new-world camelids, alpacas and llamas, are also susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Currently, it is unknown whether Bactrian camels are susceptible to infection. The distribution of Bactrian camels overlaps partly with that of the dromedary camel in west and central Asia. The receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4, of the Bactrian camel was 98.3% identical to the dromedary camel DPP4, and 100% identical for the 14 residues which interact with the MERS-CoV spike receptor. Upon intranasal inoculation with 107 plaque-forming units of MERS-CoV, animals developed a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but shedding of large quantities of MERS-CoV from the URT was observed. These data are similar to infections reported with dromedary camel infections and indicate that Bactrians are susceptible to MERS-CoV and given their overlapping range are at risk of introduction and establishment of MERS-CoV within the Bactrian camel populations.
a1fbe97ec8521ddb7624d7f2b2901d7eed813838	The need for reliable and widely available SARS-CoV-2 testing is well recognized, but it will be equally necessary to develop quantitative methods that determine viral load in order to guide patient triage and medical decision making. We are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral load at the time of presentation is an independent predictor of COVID-19 mortality in a large patient cohort (n=1,145). Viral loads should be used to identify higher-risk patients that may require more aggressive care and should be included as a key biomarker in the development of predictive algorithms.

Adjoint negations are a generalization of residuated negations built from the implications of an adjoint triple. Specifically, this work shows how to build adjoint triples on the unit interval such that their adjoint negations coincide with a given weak negation. Moreover, the algebraic structure formed by these adjoint triples is also investigated.

6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common viral pathogen that causes lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children globally. In this study, we developed a duplex reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (duplex-rtRAA) assay containing an internal control in a single closed tube for the detection of human RSV. The internal control in the amplification effectively eliminated false-negative results and ensured the accuracy of the duplex-rtRAA system. We first developed and evaluated a universal singleplex-rtRAA assay for RSV. The sensitivity of this assay for RSV was determined as 4.4 copies per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. Next, a duplex-rtRAA assay with an internal control was established. The sensitivity of the duplex-rtRAA assay approached 5.0 copies per reaction, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The two detection methods (singleplex-rtRAA and duplex-rtRAA) developed in this study were used to test 278 clinical specimens, and the results showed absolute consistency with RSV RT-qPCR analysis, demonstrating 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. These data indicate that the duplex-rtRAA has great potential for the rapid detection of RSV with a high sensitivity. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are one of the main causes of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and death, especially in children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals [1-3]. The major pathogens causing ARTIs in infants and young children are viruses, the most frequently reported of which include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	In addition to top-down Health-Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health-EDRM) efforts, bottom-up individual and household measures are crucial for prevention and emergency response of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). There is limited scientific evidence of the knowledge, perception, attitude and behavior patterns of the urban population. A computerized randomized digital dialing, cross-sectional, population landline-based telephone survey was conducted from 22 March to 1 April 2020 in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. Data were collected for socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude and risk perception, and various self-reported Health-EDRM behavior patterns associated with COVID-19. The final study sample was 765. Although the respondents thought that individuals (68.6%) had similar responsibilities as government (67.5%) in infection control, less than 50% had sufficient health risk management knowledge to safeguard health and well-being. Among the examined Health-EDRM measures, significant differences were found between attitude and practice in regards to washing hands with soap, ordering takeaways, wearing masks, avoidance of visiting public places or using public transport, and travel avoidance to COVID-19-confirmed regions. Logistic regression indicated that the elderly were less likely to worry about infection with COVID-19. Compared to personal and household hygiene practices, lower compliance was found for public social distancing.
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	Objective: Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic requires accurate forecasting of health system capacity requirements using readily available inputs. We examined whether testing and hospitalization data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter-in-place (SIP) order. Materials and Methods: 16,103 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed on 15,807 patients at Stanford facilities between March 2 and April 11, 2020. We analyzed the fraction of tested patients that were confirmed positive for COVID-19, the fraction of those needing hospitalization, and the fraction requiring ICU admission over the 40 days between March 2nd and April 11th 2020. Results: We find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of SIP even as cases continued to rise. We also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those testing positive for COVID-19 over the four weeks of SIP. The impact of this shift is a divergence between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations, both of which affects the demand on health systems. Conclusion: Without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients, current models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19. It is imperative that health systems start using these data to quantify effects of SIP and aid reopening planning.
121d9f9639fe01021279fbbe0980fe358e99d10b	The baculovirus expression system (BES) has been one of the versatile platforms for the production of recombinant proteins requiring multiple post-translational modifications, such as folding, oligomerization, phosphorylation, glycosylation, acylation, disulfide bond formation and proteolytic cleavage. Advances in recombinant DNA technology have facilitated application of the BES, and made it possible to express multiple proteins simultaneously in a single infection and to produce multimeric proteins sharing functional similarity with their natural analogs. Therefore, the BES has been used for the production of recombinant proteins and the construction of virus-like particles (VLPs), as well as for the development of subunit vaccines, including VLP-based vaccines. The VLP, which consists of one or more structural proteins but no viral genome, resembles the authentic virion but cannot replicate in cells. The high-quality recombinant protein expression and post-translational modifications obtained with the BES, along with its capacity to produce multiple proteins, imply that it is ideally suited to VLP production. In this article, we critically review the pros and cons of using the BES as a platform to produce both enveloped and non-enveloped VLPs.

Microbiol., 1 : 65--69. A strain of bovine coronavirus (BC) adapted to tissue culture, was inoculated into organ cultures of bovine foetal trachea. Haemagglutinin in the fluid from infected organ cultures reached titres of 32 and characteristic coronavirus particles were observed electron microscopically. BC virus antigen was detected in frozen sections of the organ cultures by staining with fluorescent antibody. These data were evidence that BC virus replicated in organ cultures of respiratory tissue. The use of this technique for primary isolation of bovine coronaviruses from field material is discussed.
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	Background: The pandemic caused by coronavirus in recent months is having a devastating global effect, which puts the world under the most ever unprecedented emergency. Currently, since there are not effective antiviral treatments for Covid-19 yet, it is crucial to early detect and monitor the progression of the disease, thus helping to reduce mortality. While a corresponding vaccine is being developed, and different measures are being used to combat the virus, medical imaging techniques have also been investigated to assist doctors in diagnosing this disease. Objective: This paper presents a practical solution for the detection of Covid-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images, exploiting cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques. Methods: We employ EfficientNet and MixNet, two recently developed families of deep neural networks, as the main classification engine. Furthermore, we also apply different transfer learning strategies, aiming at making the training process more accurate and efficient. The proposed approach has been validated by means of two real datasets, the former consists of 13,511 training images and 1,489 testing images, the latter has 14,324 and 3,581 images for training and testing, respectively. Results: The results are promising: by all the experimental configurations considered in the evaluation,

The morphogenesis and proliferative rule of TGEV in porcine IECs were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence assays and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. Observations under the TEM indicated that the enveloped viral particles were roughly spherical, with diameters of between 80 and 120 nm. The virions entered porcine IECs by membrane fusion and the mature viruses in the vacuoles were transported to the cell membrane before release. The results also showed that from 0 to 12 h after TGEV infection of porcine IECs, the intracellular viral RNA content did not change significantly. Logarithmic growth occurred from 12 to 36 h, after which it gradually decreased. Moreover, the extracellular RNA content began to rise at 24 h after inoculation and then reduced gradually at approximately 48 h. This study provided a theoretical foundation for further study on the infection characteristics of TGEV in target cells.

Therefore, in the middle of the pandemic, all kind of knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 may help us to find the solution. Determining the 3D structures of the proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions are of great importance in the fight against infection. Besides, post-translational modifications of the protein on 3D structure should be revealed in order to understand the protein function since these modifications are responsible for the host-pathogen interaction. Based on these, we predicted O-glycosylation and phosphorylation positions using full amino acid sequence of S1 protein. Candidate positions were further analyzed with enzyme binding activity, solvent accessibility, surface area parameters and the positions determined with high accuracy rate were used to design full 3D glycoprotein structure of the S1 protein using carbohydrate force field. In addition, the interaction between the C-type lectin CD209L and α -mannose residues was examined and carbohydrate recognition positions were predicted. We suggest these positions as a potential target for the inhibition of the initial binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein to the host cell.

Ang II, via the Ang II type 1 receptor, directly causes cellular phenotypic changes and cell growth, regulates the gene expression of various bioactive substances, and activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, as well as vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Recently, new factors have been discovered, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin-(1-7), and its receptor Mas.

58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	Objectives: Calcium channel blockers are highly protein-bound medications frequently used in the management of hypertension. Overdose results in severe hypotension and is the fourth most common cause of toxicity-related deaths in the United States. Management is mostly supportive, with currently no standard role for targeted drug removal. The protein-bound nature of these medications presents the option of utilizing albumin dialysis for their removal and for the reversal of associated shock. Design and Subjects: We present two cases of life-threatening intentional amlodipine overdoses successfully treated with albumin dialysis. Both patients experienced profound distributive shock in the setting of preserved cardiac contractility that was refractory to maximal vasoactive agent support. Interventions and Results: After initiation of albumin dialysis, the patients showed rapid hemodynamic improvement and were able to be weaned off vasopressor support. Conclusions: These cases demonstrate the safety and efficacy of albumin dialysis in the management of near-fatal calcium channel blocker overdoses related to amlodipine and offer an additional therapeutic option apart from conventional supportive care. Importantly, these cases were not associated with impaired cardiac contractility, thereby making venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a less preferable option. Furthermore, this therapeutic benefit of albumin dialysis can potentially be extended to the management of toxicity related to other highly protein-bound drugs and toxins.
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	As an emerging infectious disease, the 2019 coronavirus disease has developed into a global pandemic. During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.
3d8ecb8a971ade120ad011b3e1d93d588d2ae81a	We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different backends of the ProB constraint solver. For this, we train a random forest over a database of constraints to classify whether a backend is able to find a solution within a given amount of time or answers unknown. The forest is then analysed in regards of feature importances to determine subsets of the B language in which the respective backends excel or lack for performance. The results are compared to our initial assumptions over each backend's performance in these subsets based on personal experiences. While we do employ classifiers, we do not aim for a good predictor, but are rather interested in analysis of the classifier's learned knowledge over the utilised B constraints. The aim is to strengthen our knowledge of the different tools at hand by finding subsets of the B language in which a backend performs better than others.

Beyond the lungs, the virus can infect the kidney, causing acute injury. ACE2 expression is increased approximately two-fold in diabetic kidney disease biopsies SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of the Covid-19 pandemic, enters cells by binding to ACE2 on cell surfaces. Beyond the lungs, the virus can infect the kidney, causing acute injury. ACE2 expression is increased approximately two-fold in diabetic kidney disease biopsies Objective Diabetes is associated with adverse outcomes including death following infection. Beyond the lungs, SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of the Covid-19 pandemic, can infect a range of other tissues including the kidney, potentially contributing to the acute kidney injury in those with severe disease. We hypothesised that the renal abundance of ACE2, the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2, may be modulated by diabetes and agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The expression of ACE2 was examined in 49 archival kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease and from 12 healthy, potential living allograft donors using next generation sequencing technology (RNA Seq). Mean ACE2 mRNA was increased approximately two-fold in diabetes when compared with healthy controls (13.2 ± 7.9 versus 7.7 ± 3.6 reads per million reads [RPM]; mean ± SD; diabetic versus controls; p = 0.001). No difference in transcript abundance was noted between recipients and non-recipients of agents that block the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (12.2 ± 6.7 versus 16.2 ± 10.7 RPM; RAAS recipients versus non-recipients; p=0.25). Increased ACE2 mRNA in the diabetic kidney may increase the risk and/or severity of kidney infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of Covid-19 disease. Further studies are SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of the Covid-19 pandemic, enters cells by binding to ACE2 on cell surfaces. Beyond the lungs, the virus can infect the kidney, causing acute injury. ACE2 expression is increased approximately two-fold in diabetic kidney disease biopsies

8cd8139445fbf9839d4cd4c95b95b3f0d1b941d2	Background: Anti-synthetase (AS) and dermato-pulmonary associated with anti-MDA-5 antibodies (aMDA-5) syndromes are near one of the other autoimmune inflammatory myopathies potentially responsible for severe acute interstitial lung disease. We undertook a 13-year retrospective multicenter study in 35 French ICUs in order to describe the clinical presentation and the outcome of patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure (ARF) revealing AS or aMDA-5 syndromes. Results: From 2005 to 2017, 47 patients (23 males; median age 60 [1st-3rd quartiles 52-69] years, no comorbidity 85%) were admitted to the ICU for ARF revealing AS (n = 28, 60%) or aMDA-5 (n = 19, 40%) syndromes. Muscular, articular and cutaneous manifestations occurred in 11 patients (23%), 14 (30%) and 20 (43%) patients, respectively. Seventeen of them (36%) had no extra-pulmonary manifestations. C-reactive protein was increased (139 [40-208] mg/L), whereas procalcitonine was not (0.30 [0.12-0.56] ng/mL). Proportion of patients with creatine kinase ≥ 2N was 20% (n = 9/47). Forty-two patients (89%) had ARDS, which was severe in 86%, with a rate of 17% (n = 8/47) of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. Proportion of patients who received corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasma exchange were 100%, 72%, 15%, 21% and 17%, respectively. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 45% (n = 21/47) and 51% (n = 24/47), respectively. Patients with aMDA-5 dermatopulmonary syndrome had a higher hospital mortality than those with AS syndrome (n = 16/19, 84% vs. n = 8/28, 29%; p = 0.001). Intensivists should consider inflammatory myopathies as a cause of ARF of unknown origin. Extra-pulmonary manifestations are commonly lacking. Mortality is high, especially in aMDA-5 dermato-pulmonary syndrome. which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.
1679d2d946adeb59a2ce943f067d4bde57f5577d	Mycoplasma haemofelis" and "Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis" are feline hemoplasmas that induce hemolytic anemia. Protection from homologous re-challenge was recently demonstrated in cats recovered from primary infection. Here, we determined if cats recovered from "Cand. M. turicensis" infection were protected against infections with the more pathogenic M. haemofelis. Ten specified pathogen-free cats were exposed to M. haemofelis. Five of the ten cats had recovered from "Cand. M. turicensis" bacteremia (group A), and five cats were naïve controls (group B). No cross-protection was observed. By contrast, the "Cand. M. turicensis"-recovered cats displayed faster M. haemofelis infection onset (earlier PCR-positive and anemic) than the controls. No "Cand. M. turicensis" was detected in any cat. M. haemofelis shedding was observed in saliva, feces and urine. In both groups, evidence of a Th1 response was observed (high IFN-γ, low IL-4), but IL-10 levels were also high. In group A, total, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased within days after M. haemofelis exposure. At times of maximal bacteremia, macrocytic hypochromic anemia, neutropenia, monocytosis and a decrease in leukocyte, eosinophil, and lymphocyte counts and subsets thereof (B-and T-cells, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ cells) were particularly significant in group A. Moreover, an increase in protein concentrations, hypoalbuminemia and a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia were observed. Five of ten M. haemofelis-infected cats subsequently cleared bacteremia without antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, the study suggests that a previous hemoplasma infection, even when the cat has ostensibly recovered, may influence subsequent infections, lead to an enhancement phenomenon and other differences in infection kinetics.
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP9 correlates with blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption during many neuroinflammatory diseases. During neurotropic coronavirus virus (JHMV) induced encephalomyelitis, MMP9 activity is restricted to neutrophils. Furthermore, myeloid cell depletion implicated MMP9 in facilitating leukocyte central nervous system (CNS) infiltration via loss of BBB integrity. The requirement of MMP9 in BBB disruption was thus assessed in JHMV infected MMP9 deficient (MMP9 −/− ) mice. Depletion of neutrophils reduced CNS accumulation of monocytes and T cells, albeit without affecting overall pathogenesis. By contrast, infected MMP9 −/− mice revealed no differences in CNS leukocyte infiltration, composition or localization, consistent with BBB disruption similar to wild type (WT) mice. Unimpaired T cell mediated virus control supported an unexpectedly redundant role of MMP9 in promoting leukocyte access to the brain parenchyma. While MMP9 deficiency did not expand the overall limited pattern of MMP expression during JHMV infection, it coincided with MMP3 upregulation. MMP3 expression remained largely confined to astrocytes, similar to WT mice. These data demonstrate that neutrophil-derived MMP9 is not the sole mediator facilitating parenchymal leukocyte entry via BBB disruption during viral encephalomyelitis. Moreover, significantly enhanced MMP3 expression by astrocytes in infected MMP9 −/− mice suggests an active role of resident cells in participating and potentially collaborating with infiltrating cells in regulating BBB permeability. Overall, these results highlight the complexity of targeting individual MMPs as a strategy to regulate inflammation.

9c1c6037784f97a987e79a92077dad0d252b7236	Small-molecule fragments binding to biomacromolecules can be starting points for the development of drugs, but are often difficult to detect due to low affinities. Here we present a strategy that identifies protein-binding fragments through their potential to induce the targetguided formation of covalently bound, irreversible enzyme inhibitors. A protein-binding nucleophile reacts reversibly with a bis-electrophilic warhead, thereby positioning the second electrophile in close proximity of the active site of a viral protease, resulting in the covalent de-activation of the enzyme. The concept is implemented for Coxsackie virus B3 3C protease, a pharmacological target against enteroviral infections. Using an aldehyde-epoxide as bis-electrophile, active fragment combinations are validated through measuring the protein inactivation rate and by detecting covalent protein modification in mass spectrometry. The structure of one enzyme-inhibitor complex is determined by X-ray crystallography. The presented warhead activation assay provides potent non-peptidic, broad-spectrum inhibitors of enteroviral proteases.
8dffc4c34ac1c81eeaee40288b4ee1845b29b373	Viral investigations were performed during 4 winter seasons (88/89, 89/90, 92/93, 93/94) in children attending day-care centers (DCCs) in the Rhône Département in eastern France. Over the total observation period of 4 winter seasons. 780 children were screened with a nasal swab for the presence of viruses. Of those. 230 (29.5%) had a positive viral culture. The viruses identified w'ere respiratory' syncytial virus (RSV). influenza A and B virus, parain fluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus. adenovirus and enterovirus. During that time, 83 epi demic events in 47 DCC were recorded. A particular virus wasjudged to be causally related to an epidemic if the identical virus was isolated in > 3 children during the same outbreak of respiratory diseases. Thus, in 51 cases (61.4%) of all epidemics, the following viruses were responsible for an epidemic: RSV (n = 23), coronavirus (n = 10) (only during the season of 1993-1994), influenza A virus (n = 6), rhinovirus (n = 4), enterovirus (n = 4), adenovirus (n = 3) and parainfluenza virus (n = 1). Except for the somewhat surprising accumulation of coro navirus epidemics during the winter of 1993-1994, there were only minor seasonal variations from one year to another. As expected. RSV accounted for about one third of all respiratory' tract infections in children attending DCCs and was therefore the most important single causative agent. These results are compared with data from children who did not attend a DCC and were cared for in a private practice. During the winter of 1989-1990, the viral epidemiological survey was performed at the same time and in parallel to a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study investigating the efficacy of OM-85 BV. an immunoactive bacterial extract. This study, enrolling 423 children attending DCCs demonstrated a protec tive effect of OM-85 BV in significantly reducing the risk of recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract during the treatment period with the compound. 34% of all participating children (75 in the verum group, 70 in the placebo group) were enrolled in an additional virological study. In these patients, RSV was isolated 10 times in the placebo group, but only 5 times in the treated group (p < 0.05) and influenza A virus was present in 4 children in the placebo group, but only in 1 infant in the verum group giving a total of 14 positive virologie results in the placebo group versus 6 in the verum group Ip < 0.05). Despite the small numbers of children investigated for their virologie status during respiratory infectious outbreaks, there was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of virus carriers in favor of the children treated with OM-85 BV. These results corroborate the clinical findings.
67ade0b1e3a29d308c790bb336231d20db397810	Emerging coronaviruses (CoV) are constant global public health threats to society. Multiple ongoing clinical trials for vaccines and antivirals against CoVs showcase the availability of medical interventions to both prevent and treat the future emergence of highly pathogenic CoVs in human. However, given the diverse nature of CoVs and our close interactions with wild, domestic and companion animals, the next epidemic zoonotic CoV could resist the existing vaccines and antivirals developed, which are primarily focused on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV). In late 2019, the novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing global public health concern. In this review, we will summarize the key advancements of current vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as discuss the challenge and opportunity in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis. At the end, we advocate the development of a "plug-and-play" platform technologies that could allow quick manufacturing and administration of broad-spectrum countermeasures in an outbreak setting. We will discuss the potential of AAV-based gene therapy technology for in vivo therapeutic antibody delivery to combat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the future emergence of severe CoVs.
1c2cf112f9aee64dae0b6e09be44c367cdede066	A variety of predisposing factors have been associated with serious illness and death from COVID-19. Understanding the distribution of risks associated with these factors by local communities can provide important opportunities for targeting interventions. We characterize the distribution of risk for COVID-19 mortality for populations at large across 442 US cities, by utilizing recently published estimates of risk associated with age, gender, ethnicity, social deprivation and 12 health conditions from a very large UK-based study, combined with the information available on prevalence and co-occurrence of these factors in the US through a variety of population-based public databases. We estimate that across all the cities, an underlying weighted risk-score can identify a total of approximately 12.65 million, 4.09 million and 1.34 million individuals who are at 2-, 5-and 10-fold higher risk, respectively, compared to the average risk for the US population. The percentage of population which exceed the respective risk thresholds varies across the cities in the range (1 st -99 th percentile), 3.6%-20.1%, 0.7%-8.0% and 0.1%-3.2%, respectively. The percentage of deaths within a city that are expected to occur above these risk-thresholds varies in the range of 20.1%-53.5%, 8.5%-38.2% and 2.9%-25.4%, respectively. Our analysis can provide guidance to national and local policy makers regarding resources needed to protect the most vulnerable populations in these communities, and how much utility such interventions may have in reducing the total population burden of death.
93d1f32b5ded4a2dfc0615e44a714af19ce11942	spike (S) protein predominate over time in locales where it is found, implying that this change enhances viral transmission. We therefore compared the functional properties of the S proteins with aspartic acid (S D614 ) and glycine (S G614 ) at residue 614. We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with S G614 infected ACE2expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with S D614 . This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, S G614 did not bind ACE2 more efficiently than S D614 , and the pseudoviruses containing these S proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma. These results show S G614 is more stable than S D614 , consistent with epidemiological data suggesting that viruses with S G614 transmit more efficiently. Until late 2019, only six coronaviruses were known to infect humans: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV. A seventh, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the winter of 2019 from Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, a virus that appeared from Guangdong province, China in late 2002. The coronavirus spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. The S protein extends from the viral membrane and is uniformly arranged as trimers on the virion surface to give the appearance of a crown (corona in . : bioRxiv preprint Latin). The coronavirus S protein is divided into two domains: S1 and S2. The S1 domain mediates receptor binding, and the S2 mediates downstream membrane fusion 1,2 . The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 3-7 , a metalloprotease that also serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 8 . A small, independently folded subdomain of S1, described as the receptor-binding domain (RBD), directly binds ACE2 when the virus engages a target cell 9-12 . The S1/S2 junction of SARS-CoV-2 is processed by a furin-like proprotein convertase in the virus producer cell. In contrast, the S1/S2 junction of SARS-CoV-1 is processed by TMPRSS2 at the cell surface or by lysosomal cathepsins in the target cells [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Both S proteins are further processed in the target cell within the S2 domain at the S2' site, an event that is also required for productive infection 19, 20 .
8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b	Transplantation of remyelination-competent cells represents a promising strategy for the treatment of demyelinating diseases. As the environment dictates the success or failure of remyelination, it is critical to understand the role that the immune system plays in transplantmediated remyelination. In this study, we evaluated the severity of neuroinflammation following transplantation of glial-committed progenitor cells into the spinal cords of mice chronically infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model in which T cells and macrophages are critical in amplifying the severity of demyelination. Transplantation was performed following viral persistence in which inflammation and demyelination are established and clinical disease is evident. Mice were sacrificed 10 and 21 days following progenitor cell transplantation and the effect on neuroinflammation evaluated. Treatment did not alter accumulation of T cells or macrophages within the CNS as compared to control mice. Moreover, progenitor cell implantation did not affect local cytokine/chemokine gene expression in the CNS. Finally, remyelination associated with transplantation did not result in an imbalance of T H 1-associated cytokine production by virus-specific T cells. These studies demonstrate that progenitor cell-mediated remyelination is not the result of modulating the composition of the cellular infiltrate nor cytokine expression by virusspecific T cells and suggest that remyelination may not depend on amelioration of the inflammatory response or alteration of cytokine secretion by virus-specific T cells.
9aac2efe358411c58bfb7946a9080e436be0a50e	The concept of a Health Promoting School has been found to be effective to improve health and well-being of students as well as a help with teaching and learning in school. Effective implementation of Health Promoting School is a complex intervention involving multi-factorial and innovative activity in many domains such as curriculum, school environment and community. Many studies evaluating Health Promoting School do not include outcomes reflecting the organisational or structural change as many of those studies are quantitative in nature and the statistical assumptions are not valid reflecting the organisational structure changes. Recent global meetings of experts have reviewed the impact on student health from the perspectives of school environment, school policies on health, action competencies on healthy living and community linkage. The English Wessex Healthy School Award Scheme and the Hong Kong Healthy School Awards Scheme have developed detailed systems to analyse whether each individual school has reached the standard of a model Health Promoting School reflecting a more holistic appreciation and understanding of all the effects of school-based health promotion with positive award-related changes. However, not many schools are able to implement Health Promoting School in its entirety, so cores indicators are needed as a starting point for wider implementation. Hong Kong Healthy School Awards Scheme is still ongoing with data for analysis of indicators with significant correlation with better health and well-being. We identified the core indicators and substantiated the requirements for successful outcomes by supplementing the established award-scheme framework with a review of recent literature and documents. Framework of Health Promoting School would go beyond improvement of health literacy to enable a more efficient system for education and health on children, hence a good investment in children. This paper highlights: How a healthy school award scheme would provide a comprehensive framework for development of Health Promoting Schools with core indicators as inputs for implementation. The details for implementation and the outcome measures for evaluation of Health Promoting School.
ec8947b5a53cfc0f5d3a4745adafdef1d26ce5f8	This paper has two purposes. The first is to review the past studies on the structure, biosynthesis, and immunological properties of a class of giycoproteins, the lysosomal enzymes, in Dictyostelium discoideum. The second purpose is to present new data on the analysis of mutant strains altered in the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked precursor of N-linked oligosaccharides, and on the characterization of new carbohydrate antigenic determinants found on multiple proteins in Dictyostelium. We will also show how a combination of genetic, biochemical and immunochemical approaches have been used to unravel a portion of the glycosylation pathway in Dictyostelium. The long-term goal of these studies is to use Dictyostelium discoideum as a model system to understand the functions of a variety of glycoconjugates in a multicellular organism. The existence of a large number of mutant strains which are altered in a variety of cellular functions, development and the posttranslational modification of multiple proteins, offers a great opportunity to explore this area.
81586d26da397e7f054e891f0190ab6246b83c1b	The coronavirus disease 2019 is raging across the world. The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	H9N2 viruses are the most widespread influenza viruses in poultry in Asia. We evaluated the infection and tropism of human and avian H9 influenza virus in the human respiratory tract using ex vivo respiratory organ culture. H9 viruses infected the upper and lower respiratory tract and the majority of H9 viruses had a decreased ability to release virus from the bronchus rather than the lung. This may be attributed to a weak neuraminidase (NA) cleavage of carbon-6-linked sialic acid (Sia) rather than carbon-3-linked Sia. The modified cleavage of N-acetlylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) by NA in H9 virus replication was observed by reverse genetics, and recombinant H9N2 viruses with amino acids (38KQ) deleted in the NA stalk, and changing the amino acid at position 431 from Proline-to-Lysine. Using recombinant H9 viruses previously evaluated in the ferret, we found that viruses which replicated well in the ferret did not replicate to the same extent in the human ex vivo cultures. The existing risk assessment models for H9N2 viruses in ferrets may not always have a strong correlation with the replication in the human upper respiratory tract. The inclusion of the human ex vivo cultures would further strengthen the future risk-assessment strategies. Most influenza viruses are widely established in the waterfowl population. While much attention has been given to the H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes, because of their disease severity in humans, another subtype, H9N2, has widely circulated in poultry in many regions of the world. H9N2 was first detected in turkeys in 1966, shorebirds in 1988, and then in ducks and chickens 1, 2 . It is now the most widespread and prevalent influenza virus in Asia. The government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region implemented interventions starting from 2001 to control this infection, by executing a mandatory monthly rest day, live quail sale ban, and in the subsequent years a biweekly rest day in the wet markets. Prior to these interventions in live bird market trading, the H9N2 virus isolation rate in Hong Kong's live poultry markets was around 5% of all birds tested increasing to almost 20% in game-birds such as quail 3 . These isolation rates are presumably similar in the greater China region in which H9N2 is regarded as the most prevalent subtype of influenza in chickens (reviewed in ref. 4), where market interventions applied in Hong Kong have not been used. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the three main lineages (Korean, G1 and Chicken/Beijing/1/94-like) of H9N2 viruses have developed from Ck/Bei and reassorted, with other H9 strains 1 . Even though H9N2 infection is mainly confined to poultry, H9N2 viruses have been detected repeatedly in swine in China 5, 6 . Laboratory confirmed cases of H9N2 infection in humans have been reported in Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 6208 |
8ad34a064c6409cac162f55317934b2288350dea	Nurses' work-related fatigue has been recognized as a threat to nurse health and patient safety. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of fatigue among first-line nurses combating with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and to analyze its influencing factors on fatigue. A multi-center, descriptive, cross-sectional design with a convenience sample was used. The statistical population consisted of the first-line nurses in 7 tertiary general hospitals from March 3, 2020 to March 10, 2020 in Wuhan of China. A total of 2667 samples from 2768 contacted participants completed the investgation, with a response rate of 96.35%. Social-demographic questionnaire, work-related questionnaire, Fatigue Scale-14, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Chinese Perceived Stress Scale were used to conduct online survey. The descriptive statistic of nurses' social-demographic characteristics was conducted, and the related variables of work, anxiety, depression, perceived stress and fatigue were analyzed by t-tests, nonparametric test and Pearson's correlation analysis. The significant factors which resulted in nurses' fatigue were further analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. The median score for the first-line nurses' fatigue in Wuhan was 4 (2, 8). The median score of physical and mental fatigue of them was 3 (1, 6) and 1 (0, 3) respectively. According to the scoring criteria, 35.06% nurses (n=935) of all participants were in the fatigue status, their median score of fatigue was 10 (8, 11), and the median score of physical and mental fatigue of them was 7 (5, 8) and 3 (2, 4) respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed the participants in the risk groups of anxiety, depression and perceived stress had higher scores on physical and mental fatigue and the statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the variables and nurses' fatigue, the frequency of exercise and nurses' fatigue had a statistically significant negative correlation, and average daily working hours had a significantly positive correlation with nurses' fatigue, and the frequency of weekly night shift had a low positive correlation with nurses' fatigue (P<0.01). There was a moderate level of fatigue among the first-line nurses fighting against COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China. Government and health authorities need to formulate and take effective intervention strategies according to the relevant risk factors, and undertake preventive measures aimed at reducing health hazards due to increased work-related fatigue among first-line nurses, and to enhance their health status and provide a safe occupational environment worldwide. Promoting both medical and nursing safety while combating with the pandemic currently is warranted.
69bce356ec4ad3fcc2a0d7ba9ecfaf0d90d8e423	Most biological processes are described as a series of interactions between proteins and other molecules, and interactions are in turn described in terms of atomic structures. To annotate protein functions as sets of interaction states at atomic resolution, and thereby to better understand the relation between protein interactions and biological functions, we conducted exhaustive all-against-all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for ligands including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids, and identified recurring elementary motifs. By integrating the elementary motifs associated with each subunit, we defined composite motifs that represent context-dependent combinations of elementary motifs. It is demonstrated that function similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity compared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites. By integrating the composite motifs associated with each protein function, we define meta-composite motifs each of which is regarded as a time-independent diagrammatic representation of a biological process. It is shown that meta-composite motifs provide richer annotations of biological processes than sequence clusters. The present results serve as a basis for bridging atomic structures to higher-order biological phenomena by classification and integration of binding site structures.
e4043cf0a2e9befeff9b5807315b9e8a167e0e69	Scarcity of fresh water resources has thrown various challenges to hydrologist. Optimum usage of resource is the only way out to handle this situation. Among the various water resources the most controllable one is the dam reservoirs. This paper deals with optimal reservoir optimization using multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Various parameters like reservoir storage capacity, spill loss, evaporation rate, water used for irrigation, water used for electricity production, rate of inflow, outflow all need to be managed in an optimal way so that water levels are managed and resource specifications are met. This is normally managed using a software, but sudden change in scenarios and change in requirements cannot be handled by such softwares. Hence we are incorporating an optimised software layer to handle such situation. Multi objective genetic algorithm was able to optimise the water usage within the usage constrains. The results were assessed based on reliability, vulnerability and resilience indices. In addition, based on a multicriteria decision-making model, it was evaluated by comparing it with other evolutionary algorithms. The simulated result shows that MOGA derived rules are promising and competitive and can be effectively used for reservoir optimization operations.
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	Infectious disease interventions like contact precautions and vaccination have proven effective in disease control and elimination. The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health effort s to control infectious diseases.
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	a VB, MDL, and CEA contributed equally Word count: 3696 ABSTRACT Introduction: Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD), including neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, is one of the most frequent and devastating sequelae of spinal cord injury (SCI), as it can lead to urinary incontinence and secondary damage such as renal failure. Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) is a promising, non-invasive neuromodulatory intervention that may prevent the emergence of the C-fibre evoked bladder reflexes that are thought to cause NDO. This paper presents the protocol for TASCI (TTNS in Acute SCI), which will evaluate the efficacy of TTNS in preventing NDO. Furthermore, TASCI will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying TTNS, and the course of NLUTD development after SCI. TASCI is a nationwide, randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, conducted at all four SCI centres in Switzerland. The longitudinal design includes a baseline assessment period 5-39 days after acute SCI and follow-up assessments occurring three, six, and twelve months after SCI. A planned 114 participants will be randomised into verum or sham TTNS groups (1:1 ratio), stratified on study centre and lower extremity motor score. TTNS is performed for 30-minutes per day, five days per week, for 6-9 weeks starting within 40 days after SCI. The primary outcome is the occurrence of NDO jeopardizing the upper urinary tract at one year after SCI, assessed by urodynamic investigation. Secondary outcome measures assess bladder and bowel function and symptoms, sexual function, neurological structure and function, functional independence, quality of life, as well as changes in biomarkers in the urine, blood, stool, and bladder tissue. Safety of TTNS is the tertiary outcome.
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	Morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases are always on the rise, especially in poorer countries and in the aging population. The inevitable, but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat. HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the more recent H1N1 influenza are only a few of the numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern era. However despite advances in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, there is need for more specific, efficacious, cost-effective and less toxic treatment and preventive drugs. In this chapter, we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity, efficacy and limited off-site toxicity, and diagnostic tools with great precision. Although time consuming, immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like fragments. Phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage. The selection of binding fragments from phage display libraries has proven significant for routine isolation of invaluable peptides, antibodies, and antibody-like domains for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here we highlight the many benefits of combining immunisation with phage display in combating infectious diseases, and how our knowledge of antibody engineering has played a crucial role in fully exploiting these platforms in generating therapeutic and diagnostic biologics towards antigenic targets of infectious organisms.
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are extremely common especially in the first year of life. Knowledge of the etiology of a RTI is essential to facilitate the appropriate management and the implementation of the most effective control measures. This perspective explains why laboratory methods that can identify pathogens in respiratory secretions have been developed over the course of many years. High-complexity multiplex panel assays that can simultaneously detect up to 20 viruses and up to four bacteria within a few hours have been marketed. However, are these platforms actually useful in pediatric clinical practice? In this manuscript, we showed that these platforms appear to be particularly important for epidemiological studies and clinical research. On the contrary, their routine use in pediatric clinical practice remains debatable. They can be used only in the hospital as they require specific equipment and laboratory technicians with considerable knowledge, training, and experience. Moreover, despite more sensitive and specific than other tests routinely used for respiratory pathogen identification, they do not offer significantly advantage for detection of the true etiology of a respiratory disease. Furthermore, knowledge of which virus is the cause of a respiratory disease is not useful from a therapeutic point of view unless influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus are the infecting agents as effective drugs are available only for these pathogens. On the other hand, multiplex platforms can be justified in the presence of severe clinical manifestations, and in immunocompromised patients for whom specific treatment option can be available, particularly when they can be used simultaneously with platforms that allow identification of antimicrobial resistance to commonly used drugs. It is highly likely that these platforms, particularly those with high sensitivity and specificity and with low turnaround time, will become essential when new drugs effective and safe against most of the respiratory viruses will be available. Further studies on how to differentiate carriers from patients with true disease, as well as studies on the implications of coinfections and identification of antimicrobial resistance, are warranted.
c944f7cb14fe5b4de0ac9e06f7fb2ea6276df046	Until vaccines and effective therapeutics become available, the practical way to transit 24 safely out of the current lockdown may include the implementation of an effective 25 testing, tracing and tracking system. However, this requires a reliable and clinically 26 validated diagnostic platform for the sensitive and specific identification of SARS-CoV-27 2. Here, we report on the development of a de novo, high-resolution and comparative 28 genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 29 assay. To further enhance the assay performance and to remove any subjectivity 30 associated with operator interpretation of result, we engineered a novel hand-held 31 smart diagnostic device. The robust diagnostic device was further furnished with 32 automated image acquisition and processing algorithms, and the collated data was 33 processed through artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines to further reduce the assay run 34 time and the subjectivity of the colorimetric LAMP detection. This advanced AI 35 algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA 36 polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. 37
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	Simple Summary: "Sudden death" has been defined by the World Health Organization as a non-violent, unexpected death occurring less than 24 h from the onset of symptoms. The causes of sudden death have been widely investigated in human forensic medicine. In contrast, few studies have been reported in the veterinary literature. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of sudden deaths in young dogs in different age ranges. A secondary aim was to collect information regarding clinical symptoms, and pathological and microbiological findings related to sudden death in young dogs. The results of the present study demonstrate that the highest frequency of sudden death occurs in animals in an age range from 10 days to 1 month and from 6 to 12 months. The most frequently observed clinical symptoms in cases of sudden death were acute respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, Canine parvovirus type 2, E. coli, Canine Distemper Virus, Clostridium perfringens type A, and Pasteurella spp. were the main causes of death observed in the present study. The results reported in the present study could provide a reference basis to better investigate sudden death in veterinary clinical practice. Abstract: In human medicine, "sudden death" has been defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a non-violent, unexpected death occurring less than 24 h from the onset of symptoms. The aims of this study were: (1) to estimate the proportional mortality ratio for "sudden and unexpected death" (SUD) in young dogs; (2) to investigate the pathological and microbiological findings in SUD cases in young dogs. For these purposes, a retrospective study of a total of 145 cases of young dead dogs was performed. For each case, we collected information about the age, medical history and the gross and microbiological findings of the animals. The results of this study found 21 cases of SUD. The most frequently observed clinical symptoms in the cases of sudden death were acute respiratory symptoms, followed by acute gastroenteric symptoms, non-specific symptoms and neurological symptoms. The evaluation of necropsy reports allowed us to observe enteritis in 18 out of 21 cases and pneumonia in seven out of 21 cases. Viral infection with Canine parvovirus type 2 was the most common cause of SUD observed. These results could provide a valuable tool for the investigation of sudden death in young dogs.
42e321eedba25d380ae44d16cdf0bbdeab83d665	The genus Sapovirus, in the family Caliciviridae, includes enteric viruses of humans and domestic animals. Information on sapovirus infection of wildlife is limited and is currently lacking for any free-ranging wildlife species in Africa. By screening a large number of predominantly fecal samples (n = 631) obtained from five carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa, sapovirus RNA was detected in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta, family Hyaenidae), African lion (Panthera leo, family Felidae), and bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis, family Canidae), but not in golden or silver-backed jackals (Canis aureus and C. mesomelas, respectively, family Canidae). A phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences placed the sapovirus strains from African carnivores in a monophyletic group. Within this monophyletic group, sapovirus strains from spotted hyenas formed one independent sub-group, and those from bat-eared fox and African lion a second sub-group. The percentage nucleotide similarity between sapoviruses from African carnivores and those from other species was low (< 70.4%). Long-term monitoring of sapovirus in a population of individually known spotted hyenas from 2001 to 2012 revealed: i) a relatively high overall infection prevalence (34.8%); ii) the circulation of several genetically diverse variants; iii) large fluctuations in infection prevalence across years, indicative of outbreaks; iv) no significant difference in the likelihood of infection between animals in different age categories. The likelihood of sapovirus infection decreased with increasing hyena group size, suggesting an encounter reduction effect, but was independent of socially mediated ano-genital contact, or the extent of the area over which an individual roamed.
f14c36bf1183ba170d828bc1bd1ce7a2fe859f4d	Currently, treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) patients, particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia, is challenging, as no effective pharmacotherapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exists. Severe pneumonia is recognized as a clinical syndrome, characterized by hyper induction of proinflammatory cytokine production, which can induce organ damage followed by edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, secondary infection, and increased mortality. Owing to the immunoregulatory and differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), we aimed to outline current insights into the clinical application of MSCs in the patients of COVID19. Based on results from preliminary clinical investigations, one predicts that MSCs therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is safe and effective although multiple clinical trials with a protracted follow-up will be necessary to determine the long term effects of the treatment on COVID19 patients.
1892489da144f424b638f17d1721bd26a520f2a6	OBJECTIVE : To describe the radiographic and ultrasonographic characteristics of the spleen and abdominal lymph nodes in clinically healthy ferrets. MATERIALS AND METHODS : Fifty-five clinically healthy ferrets were prospectively recruited for this crosssectional study. Three-view whole body radiographs and abdominal ultrasonography were performed on awake (23 out of 55) or sedated (32 out of 55) ferrets. On radiographs splenic and abdominal lymph node visibility was assessed. Splenic thickness and echogenicity and lymph node length, thickness, echogenicity, number and presence of cyst-like changes were recorded. RESULTS : The spleen was radiographically detectable in all ferrets. On ultrasound the spleen was hyperechoic to the liver (55 out of 55) and mildly hyperechoic (28 out of 55), isoechoic (15 out of 55) or mildly hypoechoic (12 out of 55) to the renal cortices. Mean splenic thickness was 11.80 ±0.34 mm. Lymph nodes were radiographically discernible in 28 out of 55 ferrets and included caudal mesenteric and sublumbar nodes. An average of 9 ±2 lymph nodes (mean± standard deviation; mode 10) were identified in each ferret using ultrasound. A single large jejunal lymph node was identified in all ferrets and had a mean thickness of 5.28 ± 1.66 mm. For other lymph nodes the mean thickness measurements plus one standard deviation were less than 4.4 mm (95% confidence interval: < _ 3.72 mm). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : The information provided in this study may act as a baseline for evaluation of the spleen and lymph nodes in ferrets.
30b8daec732ac5cec3fffac671fa23da020c9636	The total direct medical expenditures were analyzed by cost factors. We also assessed affordability by comparing the simulated out-of-pocket expenditure of COVID-19 cases relative to the per capita disposable income. Differences between groups were tested by student t test and Mann-Whitney test when appropriate. A multiple logistic regression model was built to determine the risk factors associated with high cost. Results: A total of 70 COVID-19 patients were included in the analysis. The overall mean cost was USD 6827 per treated episode. The highest mean cost was observed in drug acquisition, accounting for 45.1% of the overall cost. Total mean cost was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing diseases compared to those without preexisting diseases. Pre-existing diseases and the advanced disease severity were strongly associated with higher cost. Around USD 0.49 billion were expected for clinical manage of COVID-19 in China. Among rural households, the proportions of health insurance coverage should be increased to 70% for severe cases, and 80% for critically ill cases to avoid catastrophic health expenditure. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that clinical management of COVID-19 patients incurs a great financial burden to national health insurance. The cost for drug acquisition is the major contributor to the medical cost, whereas the risk factors for higher cost are pre-existing diseases and severity of COVID-19. Improvement of insurance coverage will need to address the barriers of rural patients to avoid the occurrence of catastrophic health expenditure.

a08e6e3d8c3de886ae461ca0843a51d80b62e855	Abstract： SARS-CoV is a newly discovery pathogen causing severe acute respiratory problems. It has been established that the S protein in this pathogen plays an important rule in the adsorption and penetration of SARS-CoV into the host cell by interaction with the ACE2 receptor. To determinant which functional motif of the S protein was involved in the interaction with ACE2, seven truncated S proteins deleted from the N or C terminal were obtained by an E.coli expression system and purified by column chromatography to homogeneity. Each truncated S protein was fixed on to the well of an ELISA plate and an interaction was initiated with the ACE2 protein. The adsorption were quantified by ELISA, and the results indicated that amino acids from 388 to 496 of the S protein was responsible for the interaction with the ACE2 receptor, and the interaction could be completely disrupted by an antibody specific to these amino acids. Deletions adjacent to this domain did not appear to have a significant impact on the interaction with ACE2, suggesting that the S protein of SARS-CoV could be developed as a vaccine to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus called 8, 
d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	Transmission of the SAR-COV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is largely driven by human behavior and person-to-person contact. By staying home, people reduce the probability of contacting an infectious individual, becoming infected, and passing on the virus. One of the most promising sources of data on time use is smartphone location data. We develop a time use driven proportional mixing SEIR model that naturally incorporates time spent at home measured using smartphone location data and allows people of different health statuses to behave differently. We simulate epidemics in almost every county in the United States. The model suggests that Americans' behavioral shifts have reduced cases in 55%-86% of counties and for 71%-91% of the population, depending on modeling assumptions. Resuming pre-epidemic behavior would lead to a rapid rise in cases in most counties. Spatial patterns of bending and flattening the curve are robust to modeling assumptions. Depending on epidemic history, county demographics, and behavior within a county, returning those with acquired immunity (assuming it exists) to regular schedules generally helps reduce cumulative COVID-19 cases. The model robustly identifies which counties would experience the greatest share of case reduction relative to continued distancing behavior. The model occasionally mischaracterizes epidemic patterns in counties tightly connected to larger counties that are experiencing large epidemics. Understanding these patterns is critical for prioritizing testing resources and back-to-work planning for the United States.
2c45b13dad8a37a27ba2ab7569b70ebbea104ac1	Lysates of cultured cells have been analyzed for arginine-specific endoproteases using peptidyl-p-nitroanilides as chromogenic substrates. The enzymes present in MDBK, MDCK, VERO, BHK, and chick embryo cells required lysinearginine or arginine-arginine pairs as cleavage sites, whereas chorioallantoic membrane cells contained, in addition, an activity that could cleave at a single arginine. The effect of peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones on the activation of the fowl plague virus hemagglutinin by the proteases specific for paired basic residues has been investigated. When virions containing uncleaved hemagglutinin were incubated with lysates of uninfected cells, cleavage was completely inhibited by peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones containing paired basic residues at a concentration of 1 mM. In contrast a compound containing a single arginine had no inhibitory activity. When dibasic peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones were added to infected cell cultures, cleavage of hemagglutinin and multiple cycles of virus replication were inhibited at 10 mM. However, a 1 OO-to 200-fold increase of the inhibitory activity in intact cells could be achieved by N-terminal acylation. These studies suggest a potential role of peptidyl chloroalkyl ketones as antiviral agents. Q 1989Academic PWS. I~C.
ec12056191b32c3676eeb2648b11e4e8fbebcf62	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a precipitous increase in the need for molecular diagnostics. Unfortunately, access to RNA extraction reagents can represent a bottleneck for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based methodologies, stemming from both extraordinary supplychain stresses and the global reach of the virus into resource-limited settings. To provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments, we report here an "unextracted modification" for qRT-PCR using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) widely utilized primers/probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (N1/N2/N3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and RP-control targeting human RNase P). This approach replaces RNA extraction/purification with a heat-inactivation step of viral transport media (VTM), followed by direct inoculation-with or without VTM spin concentration-into PCR master mixes. Using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow, we compared traditional and unextracted CDC methodologies. Although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident (by higher C t values) without extraction, in particular for the N2 primer/probe-set, we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for N1 , and RP (unconcentrated and concentrated VTM-81/81). The negative categorical agreement for N1/N2/N3 was likewise high. Overall, these results suggest that laboratories could adapt and validate unextracted qRT-PCR protocols as a contingency to overcome supply limitations, with minimal impact on categorical results.
6d6fc56c179dfe8a78bd20443247cd123d4cf7c2	The plausible release of deeply engineered or even entirely synthetic/artificial microorganisms raises the issue of their intentional (e.g. bioremediation) or accidental interaction with the Environment. Containment systems designed in the 1980s-1990s for limiting the spread of genetically engineered bacteria and their recombinant traits are still applicable to contemporary Synthetic Biology constructs. Yet, the ease of DNA synthesis and the uncertainty on how non-natural properties and strains could interplay with the existing biological word poses yet again the challenge of designing safe and efficacious firewalls to curtail possible interactions. Such barriers may include xeno-nucleic acids (XNAs) instead of DNA as information-bearing molecules, rewriting the genetic code to make it non-understandable by the existing gene expression machineries, and/or making growth dependent on xenobiotic chemicals.
e9dda9694a2e4c405b84595621b777223793d69a	Functional protein microarrays are emerging as a promising new tool for large-scale and highthroughput studies. In this article, we will review their applications in basic proteomics research, where various types of assays have been developed to probe binding activities to other biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules, and glycans. We will also report recent progress of using functional protein microarrays in profiling protein posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and nitrosylation. Finally, we will discuss potential of functional protein microarrays in biomarker identification and clinical diagnostics. We strongly believe that functional protein microarrays will soon become an indispensible and invaluable tool in proteomics research and systems biology.
0be19bfb83d9eb0a6b6f1c7ce8b75a58d8b1ed6f	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus (CoV) discovered in the 1970s that infects the intestinal tract of pigs, resulting in diarrhea and vomiting. It can cause extreme dehydration and death in neonatal piglets. In Asia, modified live attenuated vaccines have been used to control PEDV infection in recent years. However, a new strain of PEDV that belongs to genogroup 2a appeared in the USA in 2013 and then quickly spread to Canada and Mexico as well as Asian and European countries. Due to the less effective protective immunity provided by the vaccines against this new strain, it has caused considerable agricultural and economic loss worldwide. The emergence of this new strain increases the importance of understanding PEDV as well as strategies for inhibiting it. Coronaviral proteases, including main proteases and papain-like proteases, are ideal antiviral targets because of their essential roles in viral maturation. Here we provide a first description of the expression, purification and structural characteristics of recombinant PEDV papain-like protease 2, moreover present our finding that 6-thioguanine, a chemotherapeutic drug, in contrast to its competitive inhibition on SARS-and MERS-CoV papain-like proteases, is a noncompetitive inhibitor of PEDV papain-like protease 2.
c876f62d83c9cdf3997ffe0c528e55ba51937f82	in transplant and immunocompromised patients. 1 Antimicrobial use for respiratory viruses, the most common pathogens associated with community acquired pneumonia, presents an opportunity of interest for stewardship efforts. 2 Prolonged antibiotic therapy in the setting of viral pneumonia in this population is associated with increased lengths of stay and development of multi-drug resistant organisms. 3 Use of rapid diagnostics, and particularly respiratory virus panels (RVP), is a recommended AMS initiative to reduce inappropriate antibiotic therapy by effectively ruling-in/out common respiratory viruses. 4 Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing has laboratory advantages of high sensitivity (up to 100%) and fast turnaround time (as little as 1 hour). These components make a more attractive tool for AMS, in comparison to standard respiratory cultures. 5 However, there is conflicting evidence for beneficial impact on clinical outcomes and resource utilization such as decreased antibiotic duration of therapy and hospital length of stay. 5-7 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact on antimicrobial utilization following implementation of an in-house RVP, coupled with AMS audit and feedback, in immunocompromised patients. In an IRB-approved single-center quasi-experimental study, interventions in immunocompromised patients tested with a RVP were Abstract Antimicrobial management of viral pneumonia has proven to be a challenge in hospitalized immunocompromised patients. A host of factors contribute to the dilemma, such as diagnostic uncertainty, lack of organism identification, and clinical status of the patient. Respiratory virus panel (RVP) use was compared between 131 immunocompromised patients who received send-out (n = 56) vs in-house (n = 75) testing. Antimicrobial optimization interventions consisted of antiviral addition/discontinuation, antibiotic discontinuation/de-escalation, or modification of immunosuppressive regimen. After implementation of an in-house test with audit and feedback, turnaround time of the RVP was reduced from 46.7 to 5.5 hours (P < .001) and time to intervention was reduced from 52.1 to 13.9 hours (P < .001), yet the frequency of antimicrobial optimization interventions was unchanged (30.7% vs 35.7%). Differences were not observed in duration of empiric antibiotic therapy or length of stay. The overall discontinuation rate for patients tested with a RVP was low (4.6%), and those with positive RVP (n = 43) had antibiotics stopped in 14% of cases. Bacterial pneumonia coinfection was confirmed in 2 patients. Further systematic efforts should be taken to reduce antibiotic use in viral pneumonia and identify the major barriers in the immunocompromised population.
d83c6b445157b135b1bccacd8f3ad4fc539280b3	Background: Schistosoma infection is geographically widespread with a relatively low mortality rate, but a high morbidity rate, causing severe debilitating illness in millions of people worldwide. The disease is often associated with water resource development projects, such as dams where the snail intermediate hosts (Bulinus species) of the parasite breed. We present three cases to raise awareness of the continued existence of tissue schistosomiasis. Infestation may present acutely or insidiously with often debilitating consequences in many organs. Design: Case 1: A 35year old man died within 12 hours of admission to the ER for chest pain. Autopsy showed a left ventricular failure from hypertensive heart disease resulting from chronic pyelonephritis from bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureters from bilateral ureteric stenosis from chronic urinary Schistosoma haematobium infestation evidenced by numerous calcified Schistosoma haematobium ova with surrounding extensive chronic granulomatous inflammatory changes with intense fibrosis of the ureters. Fig 1. Case 2: A 14-year-old female presented with prolapsed sessile anorectal polyp. Biopsy diagnosed an ulcerated, polypoid, inflammatory mass, with a core of Schistosoma haematobium ova surrounded by an intense infiltrate of eosinophils, admixed with plasma cells and lymphocytes. There were eosinophil mucosal and crypt abscesses surrounding Schistosoma haematobium ova. Fig 2 (top) Case 3: A 16-year-old boy had an appendicectomy for acute appendicitis. Histopathological examination of the appendix showed extensive transmural eosinophil dominated acute inflammation with eosinophil abscesses superimposed on chronic granulomatous inflammation to Schistosoma haematobium ova. A diagnosis of Schistosoma haematobium related acute appendicitis was made. Figure 2 (bottom) Results: Two patients presented acutely and required urgent care. Their histopathological picture was acute and dominated by eosinophil abscesses. The urinary tract infestation was however chronic and insidious and sadly resulted in a mortality. The wide variation in age of patients underscores the difficult epidemiology of schistosomiasis infestations. Background: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the Anal Canal (AC) incidence has been increasing over the past several decades and is higher in women than in men. Infection with high risk (HR) Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is strongly associated with AC SCC. Our aim is to examine associations between the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients according to HPV status. Design: Retrospective study of 1,250 invasive AC SCC diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 in our institution. Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected from the respective medical files. Paraffin blocks were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by in situ hybridization and/or the p16 oncoprotein by immunohistochemistry. Results: Among the 1,250 patients with AC SCC, 887 (71%) were women. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years. Thirty-five percent of women had previous history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 25% of men had a strong (>30 pack-year) tobacco history. Of the 680 cases reviewed, 652 (96%) had detectable HPV. HPV 16 was the most frequent type detected. High grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) was found in 65% of the surgical specimens. Most patients included in the present study were female (71%). HPV was present in 652 of 680 (96%) samples analyzed. AC SCC was preceded by HGAIN in 65% of the cases. The results of this study demonstrate the evolving importance of anal HPV-related pathology and cancer among women. Background: Schistosomiasis, endemic in many countries, is an important risk factor of urinary bladder carcinoma. While PARP-1 is related to tumorogenesis and became an important molecule for targeted therapy, PTEN is responsible of DNA repair. COX-2 is an angiogenic factor playing a fundamental role in inflammation-related tumorogenesis. The aim of the current study is to investigate the colocalization of these markers in Schistosomal-positive urinary carcinoma in comparison to non-Schistosomal carcinoma, their prognostic impact and if targeted therapy is useful in this endemic disease. Background: Acute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS) is an aggressive form of fungal sinusitis in which early diagnosis and intervention are known to improve patient outcome. Intraoperative consultation with frozen section has been shown to decrease time to diagnosis when compared with permanent section pathology. This study is intended to determine diagnostic accuracy of frozen section in AIFS at a single institution. Design: The University Hospital database was accessed to find archived cases in which frozen section was performed for evaluation for AIFS between the years 2009-2018. Frozen sections were considered positive for AIFS if invasive hyphal forms were reported with the exception of candida. All cases were reviewed by an experienced pathologist. The frozen section findings were compared with the permanent sections, including tissue microbial stains, as well as tissue culture. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were estimated with 95% confidence interval. (27) patients with a total of sixty seven (67) frozen section evaluations for AIFS were included in the study. Thirtyfive of the biopsy specimens (35/67 or 52.2%) were considered positive for AIFS on final pathology, while the remaining 32/67 (47.7%) were negative. Of the 35 positive biopsy specimens, 31 were positive on frozen section. Of the 32 negative biopsy specimens, all were negative for fungal organisms on frozen section. Frozen section diagnosis demonstrated a sensitivity of 88.6% (95% CI, 0.72-0.96), specificity of 100% (95% CI, 0.87-1), PPV of 100% (95% CI, 0.86-1), and NPV of 88.9% (95% CI, 0.73-0.96). Results: Twenty seven This study represents the largest series assessing the diagnostic accuracy of frozen section analysis in AIFS. The results confirm the value of intraoperative consultation with frozen section for confirming AIFS and provide a quantitative estimate of the reliability of negative results. Background: Adenovirus causes up to 10% of viral illness worldwide, including enterocolitis. Immunocompetent individuals experience transient symptoms, but immunocompromised patients, like stem cell transplant recipients, can develop life-threatening disease. Brincidofovir is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with activity against adenovirus that may be used in this patient population. Parsing out the cause of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in these patients is challenging, and the effect of brincidofovir on the GI tract is unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the histologic features in the GI tract of patients taking brincidofovir. Design: Adults status post allogeneic stem cell transplant who had GI biopsy samples obtained before and after receiving brincidofovir were included. Thus far, 5 patients have had histologic slides reviewed. Clinical information, including dates of transplant, adenovirus diagnosis, and brincidofovir treatment were obtained from the medical record. All had adenoviremia by PCR; one also tested positive for both fecal and respiratory infection. Post-therapy GI biopsies were taken within 1-10 days of a patient receiving brincidofovir.
643cc46616580faba24162bfca4bba175fb70384	The resurgence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the form of unprecedented and explosive epidemics in India and the Indian Ocean islands after a gap of 32 years is a major public health concern. Currently, there is no specific therapy available to treat CHIKV infection. In the present study, the in vitro prophylactic and therapeutic effects of chloroquine on CHIKV replication in Vero cells were investigated. Inhibitory effects were observed when chloroquine was administered pre-infection, post-infection, and concurrent with infection, suggesting that chloroquine has prophylactic and therapeutic potential. The inhibitory effects were confirmed by performing a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis of viral RNA levels, and cell viability assays. Chloroquine diminished CHIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner, with an effective concentration range of 5-20 mM. Concurrent addition of drug with virus, or treatment of cells prior to infection drastically reduced virus infectivity and viral genome copy number by !99.99%. The maximum inhibitory effect of chloroquine was observed within 1-3 hr post-infection (hpi), and treatment was ineffective once the virus successfully passed through the early stages of infection. The mechanism of inhibition of virus activity by chloroquine involved impaired endosomalmediated virus entry during early stages of virus replication, most likely through the prevention of endocytosis and/or endosomal acidification, based on a comparative evaluation using ammonium chloride, a known lysosomotropic agent.
e13ce866cb54f208bf75f9623e2a5bd088585a57	The protein microarray technology provides a versatile platform for characterization of hundreds of thousands of proteins in a highly parallel and high-throughput manner. It is viewed as a new tool that overcomes the limitation of DNA microarrays. On the basis of its application, protein microarrays fall into two major classes: analytical and functional protein microarrays. In addition, tissue or cell lysates can also be directly spotted on a slide to form the so-called "reverse-phase" protein microarray. In the last decade, applications of functional protein microarrays in particular have flourished in studying protein function and construction of networks and pathways. In this chapter, we will review the recent advancements in the protein microarray technology, followed by presenting a series of examples to illustrate the power and versatility of protein microarrays in both basic and clinical research. As a powerful technology platform, it would not be surprising if protein microarrays will become one of the leading technologies in proteomic and diagnostic fields in the next decade.
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may cause a hypercoagulable state. The D-dimer is frequently elevated in COVID-19, but other markers of coagulation activation, including the prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2) are poorly described. We studied hospitalized adults with COVID-19 and PF1.2 measurement performed at any time during hospitalization. We evaluated the relationship between PF1.2 and synchronously measured D-dimer. We utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate optimal thresholds for diagnosing thrombosis and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate association with thrombosis. Results: 115 patients were included [110 (95.7%) critically ill]. PF1.2 and Ddimer were moderately positively correlated (r=0.542, P<0.001) but significant discordance was observed in elevation of each marker above the laboratory reference range (59.0% elevated PF1.2 vs. 98.5% elevated D-dimer). Median PF1.2 levels were higher in patients with thrombosis than those without (611 vs. 374 pmol/L, P=0.006). In ROC analysis, PF1.2 had superior specificity and conferred a higher positive likelihood ratio in identifying patients with thrombosis than D-dimer (PF1.2 threshold of >523 pmol/L: 69.2% sensitivity, 67.7% specificity; >924 pmol/L: 37.9% sensitivity, 87.8% specificity). In multivariable analysis, a PF1.2 >500 pmol/L was significantly associated with VTE [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.26, 95% CI, 1.12-16.21, P=0.034] and any thrombotic manifestation (adjusted OR 3.85, 95% CI, 1.39-10.65, P=0.010); conversely, synchronously measured D-dimer was not significantly associated with thrombosis. 90.6% of patients with a non-elevated PF1.2 result did not develop VTE. Conclusions: PF1.2 may be a useful assay, and potentially more discriminant than D-dimer, in identifying thrombotic manifestations in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Next, we found that ALV-J CHN06 strain infection of DF-1 cells correlated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) activation, which was mainly induced within 15 min, a very early stage of infection, and at a late infection stage, from 108 h to 132 h post-infection. Infection with other ALV subgroup (A/B) strains also triggered ERK/MAPK activation. Moreover, when activating ERK2, ALV subgroups A, B and J simultaneously induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun, an AP1 family member and p38 activation but had no obvious effect on JNK activation at either 15 min or 120 h. Interestingly, only PD98059 inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation while SP600125 or SB203580 had no influence on c-Jun activation. Furthermore, the viral gp85 and gag proteins were found to contribute to ERK2/AP1 activation. Additionally, the specific ERK inhibitor, PD980509, significantly suppressed ALV replication, as evidenced by extremely low levels of ALV promoter activity and ALV-J protein expression. Avian leukosis viruses (ALV), an oncogenic retrovirus, mainly induce neoplastic diseases and other reproduction problems by both vertical and horizontal transmission infection. Based on the identity of viral envelope glycoproteins, ALV is divided into subgroups A, B, C, D, E, J and the recently identified subgroup K 1,2 . So far, most of isolated and identified ALV in China pertain to subgroups A, B and J inducing disease in the commercial meat and egg type chickens as well as in the Chinese local breeds 3-6 . ALV can cause significant economic losses as a result of tumor-induced mortality, serious immunosuppression and reduction of weight gain, egg production and breeding potential. Widespread ALV-J can induce various tumors in chickens, especially myeloid leukosis and hemangioma. Our previous study demonstrated that MYC, TERT, and ZIC1genes were identified as the common insertion sites in ALV-J induced myeloid leukosis, which might be a putative "driver" for the activation of the oncogene 7 . However, the cellular factors involved in exogenous ALV infection and oncogenesis, especially signal transduction pathways, are yet to be revealed. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) is a stable isotope method for protein measurement by using mass spectrometry 8 . In the current study, we applied iTRAQ followed by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to compare the protein profile of DF-1 cell line with and without ALV-J infection. Based on the proteome data and Western blot confirmation, we inferred that the up-regulation of
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	Feline calicivirus (FCV) is an important veterinary pathogen and causes respiratory disease in cats. Because it grows well in cell culture, FCV is often used as a model virus of non-culturable caliciviruses. In this study, a cell-free and two cell culture-based biosensor assay systems were established to detect FCV protease activity. The assays utilize luciferase sensor technology or second-generation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET 2 ). A luciferase sensor was designed to contain an FCV protease cleavage motif within the permutated luciferase (GloSensor). The BRET 2 -based probe contained the same cleavage motif flanked by a renilla luciferase and a variant of green fluorescent protein. To confirm the specificity of these assay systems, GloSensor or a BRET 2 -based probe containing a mutation in the cleavage motif was also constructed. In a cell-free assay, GloSensor showed increased luminescence in proportion to the amount of FCV protease, while no signal change was observed when the construct harboring the mutant cleavage motif was used. A feline cell line stably expressing GloSensor or the BRET 2 -based probe was established. Increased levels of GloSensor luminescence, and decreased levels of BRET 2 signals were observed according to input FCV titers. In contrast, no significant signal change was observed in the cells stably expressing the mutant cleavage motif. GloSensor and the BRET 2 -based probe were capable of detecting the inhibitory activity of ribavirin in FCV-infected cells. Our results demonstrate that these biosensors are useful to detect FCV protease activity induced in infected cells, and well worth consideration for screening of anti-FCV protease compounds in cell-free system as well as anti-FCV compounds in cultured cells.
6058e813e7b4c4f5c57eba44da2463bd5774574b	Using a =P complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared against the A59 nucleocapsid protein messenger RNA, we have investigated the extent of homology between A59 and four other strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [S2P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 7040% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [S2P]eDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virusspecific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains. The results suggest that as previously shown with A59 (S. Cheley, R. Anderson, M. J. Cupples, E. C. M. Lee Chan, and V. L. Morris (1981) Virdogy, 112,596-604), all MHV strains tested encode a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. Analysis of [?l]methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that each strain of MHV specified four major viral polypeptides with apparent molecular weights very similar to those previously reported for the E2, N, El, and PEl polypeptides of A59. The strong degree of interstrain homology among the five MHV strains investigated was confirmed by comparative chymotryptic peptide mapping of the viral N proteins. A majority of the chymotryptic peptides from each of the [35S$nethioninelabeled N proteins was found to coelute by high-performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, this technique of peptide mapping indicated a particularly strong relatedness between MHV-1 and MHV-S and among MHV3, JHM, and A59.
ef67d61ed2207fd99dc8f9041374a197ab8ab255	As software verification is gaining traction in academia and industry the number and complexity of verification tools is growing constantly. This initiated research and interest into exchangeable verification witnesses as well as tools for automated witness validation. Initial witness validators used model checkers that were amended to benefit from guidance information provided by the witness. This approach comes with substantial overhead. Second-generation execution-based validators traded speed for reduced strength in case of incomplete and non-exact witnesses. This was done by extracting test harnesses and compiling them with the original program. We present the nitwit tool, a new interpretation-based violation witness validator for C programs that is trimmed to be fast and memory efficient. It verifies a record number of witnesses of SV-COMP'20 in the ReachSafety category. Our novel tool exchanges initial compilation overhead and optimized execution for rapid startup performance. nitwit borrows C semantics from the compiler used for compilation. This offloads this hard-to-get-right task and enables using several compilers in parallel to inspect possible semantic differences.
da3b7d7eae347e6cacd8ab98c498d7a5a6136842	Past approaches to food security in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) were informed by concerns about food availability. They aimed at domestic self-sufficiency and self-sufficiency by proxy (via farmland investments abroad). These strategies have failed. Water scarcity at home increasingly compromises agricultural production. Farmland investments abroad have not matched ambitious related announcements due to a complex mixture of commercial, socio-economic and political factors. They do not contribute meaningful quantities to the Gulf countries' food imports. The failure of such strategies has prompted a shift of focus instead towards value chain management as a means to secure food availability. Rather than trying to fight food import dependence, the Gulf countries now accept and manage it. However, malnutrition that leads to high levels of obesity and diabetes constitutes a risk factor in the face of COVID-19. Food accessibility for vulnerable population segments such as migrant labour is another issue that requires yet further policy measures, such as safety netswhose expansion would be politically controversial if not impossible, however.
53430dac5e3f325a8f4a8a20cabf1c33e55dc4c7	Aim To characterise symptoms, key findings and clinical outcomes in older adults with COVID-19. Findings 12% of older individuals did not present with classical COVID-19 symptoms, though fever, dyspnoea, delirium and raised inflammation were associated with higher mortality. Compared with fitter older individuals, some measures of immune activity were lower in frailer patients. Message COVID-19 may present without cardinal symptoms as well as implicate a possible role for age-related changes in immunity in mediating the relationship between frailty and mortality. Purpose To describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in older adults, and relate these to outcomes. Methods A cohort study of 217 individuals (median age 80, IQR 74-85 years; 62% men) hospitalised with COVID-19, followed up for all-cause mortality, was conducted. Secondary outcomes included cognitive and physical function at discharge. C-reactive protein and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were used as measures of immune activity. Results Cardinal COVID-19 symptoms (fever, dyspnoea, cough) were common but not universal. Inflammation on hospitalisation was lower in frail older adults. Fever, dyspnoea, delirium and inflammation were associated with mortality. Delirium at presentation was an independent risk factor for cognitive decline at discharge. Conclusions COVID-19 may present without cardinal symptoms as well as implicate a possible role for age-related changes in immunity in mediating the relationship between frailty and mortality.

58246d246bb1b2288dc58245c475fc314d34cc83	Oct4 is a key component of the pluripotency regulatory network, and its reciprocal interaction with Cdx2 has been shown to be a determinant of either the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or their differentiation into trophoblast. Oct4 of maternal origin is postulated to play critical role in defining totipotency and inducing pluripotency during embryonic development. However, the genetic elimination of maternal Oct4 using a Cre-lox approach in mouse revealed that the establishment of totipotency in maternal Oct4-depleted embryos was not affected, and that these embryos could complete full-term development without any obvious defect. These results indicate that Oct4 is not essential for the initiation of pluripotency, in contrast to its critical role in maintaining pluripotency. This conclusion is further supported by the formation of Oct4-GFP-and Nanog-expressing inner cell masses (ICMs) in embryos with complete inactivation of both maternal and zygotic Oct4 expression and the reprogramming of fibroblasts into fully pluripotent cells by Oct4-deficient oocytes.
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	It is often said that it takes 17 years to move medical research from bench to bedside. In a coronavirus disease world, such time-lags feel intolerable. In these extraordinary circumstances could years be made into months? If so, could those lessons be used to accelerate medical research when the crisis eases? To measure time-lags in health and biomedical research as well as to identify ways of reducing them, we developed and published (in 2015) a matrix consisting of overlapping tracks (or stages/phases) in the translation from discovery research to developed products, policies and practice. The matrix aids analysis by highlighting the time and actions required to develop research (and its translation) both (1) along each track and (2) from one track to another, e.g. from the discovery track to the research-in-humans track. We noted four main approaches to reducing time-lags, namely increasing resources, working in parallel, starting or working at risk, and improving processes. Examining these approaches alongside the matrix helps interpret the enormous global effort to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Rapid progress in the discovery/basic and human research tracks is being made through a combination of large-scale funding, work being conducted in parallel (between different teams globally and through working in overlapping tracks), working at greater (but proportionate) risk to safety than usual, and adopting various new processes. The overlapping work of some of the teams involves continuing animal research whilst entering vaccine candidates into Phase I trials alongside planning their Phase II trials. The additional funding available helps to reduce some of the usual financial risks in moving so quickly. Going forward through the increasingly large human trials for safety, dosage and efficacy, it will be vital to overlap work in parallel in the often challenging public policy and clinical tracks. Thus, regulatory and reimbursement bodies are beginning and preparing rapid action to pull vaccines proving to be safe and effective through to extraordinarily rapid application to the general population. Monitoring the development of a COVID-19 vaccine using the matrix (modified as necessary) could help identify which of the approaches speeding development and deployment could be usefully applied more widely in the future.
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	Objective: In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. Methods: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. Conclusion: Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.
1296f3cfb1b0f784c65459ae7369c9ce0dbed5c7	As the 21st century unfolds, strategies to prevent and control infectious diseases remain an area of vital interest and concern. The burden of disease, disability, and death caused by infectious diseases is felt around the world in both developed and developing nations. Moreover, the ability of infectious agents to destabilize populations, economies, and governments is strikingly apparent. To an unprecedented degree, infectious diseaserelated issues are high on the agendas of world leaders, philanthropists, policymakers, and the public. This enhanced focus, combined with recent scientific and technological advances, creates new opportunities and challenges for infectious disease research and practice. This paper examines these issues in the context of three countries: China, India, and the United States.

ed35499c69866ab5fbba908df3c26ea2cdd904c5	Rousettus leschenaulti is an abundant species in many countries of South-East Asia, including south China. We isolated seven microsatellite loci in R. leschenaulti from genomic DNA enriched for CA repeats with the enriched library method. A total of 56 samples from a population in the Guangxi Province of China were tested with these microsatellite markers. The polymorphism ranged from seven to 16 alleles, and the observed heterozygosity was 84-94%. It is the first time microsatellite markers were characterized from R. leschenaulti , and these markers can be an important tool for analysing population structure and genotypic diversity.

The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing day by day. Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policy to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This has been deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens. Finally, we propose a set of research opportunities and setup grounds for further practical applications.
69e67469f4ce120d864971efb5e8b123905ec788	Hexadecyloxypropyl esters of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates containing guanine (G) or hypoxanthine (Hx) and a (S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] [(S)-HPMP] or 2-(2-phosphonoethoxy)ethyl (PEE) acyclic moiety have been prepared. The activity of the prodrugs was evaluated in vitro against different virus families. Whereas ester derivatives of PEEHx and (S)-HPMPHx were antivirally inactive, monoesters of PEEG, and mono-and diesters of (S)-HPMPG showed pronounced antiviral activity against vaccinia virus and/or herpesviruses. Monoesters of (S)-HPMPG emerged as the most potent and selective derivatives against these DNA viruses. None of the compounds were inhibitory against RNA viruses and retroviruses. Crown

Compounds with antiviral activity were discovered among them and 3E-hydroxy-1c-aryl-3c-methyl-5D-androstano[17,16-d]pyrazolines prepared by us earlier. Syntheses of biologically active oximes, hydrazones, or carbazones of steroidal ketones have been the subject of much research [1] [2] [3] [4] . Several hydrazones and oximes of 5D-steroids that were previously synthesized by us also exhibited high antituberculosis, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activity [5] [6] [7] . Addition of fragments of natural compounds to organic molecules is known to produce new and previously unknown biological properties. Phenylacetic acid synthesized by plants can exhibit auxin-like activity according to some reports [8, 9] . Steroidal esters of phenylacetic-acid derivatives exhibited characteristic antitumor activity [10] . The drug perandren is a phenylacetate ester of testosterone that is used for osteoporosis, breast cancer, etc. The structure-activity relationship was studied using esterification of epiandrosterone (1) by phenylacetic acid chloride to produce modified ketone 2.

a31ab266e29c84202fb292bd667319662c8337cf	RNA viruses are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in humans every year. Additionally, the potential use of these viruses in acts of bioterrorism poses a threat to national security. Given the paucity of vaccines or postexposure therapeutics for many highly pathogenic RNA viruses, novel treatments are badly needed. Sequence-based drug design, under development for almost 20 years, is proving effective in animal models and has moved into clinical trials. Important advances in the field include the characterization of RNA interference in mammalian cells and chemical modifications that can dramatically increase the in vivo stability of therapeutic oligonucleotides. Antisense strategies utilize single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that inhibit protein production by mediating the catalytic degradation of target mRNA, or by binding to sites on mRNA essential for translation. Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, known as short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), also mediate the catalytic degradation of complementary mRNAs. As RNA virus infection is predicated on the delivery, replication, and translation of viral RNA, these pathogens present an obvious target for the rapidly advancing field of sequence-specific therapeutics. Antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs can be designed to target the viral RNA genome or viral transcripts. This article reviews current knowledge on therapeutic applications of antisense and RNA interference for highly pathogenic RNA viral infections.
0c0d3ae86e9c83dfc795a58ae2ecad154feff32f	We describe and analyze compartmental models for disease transmission. We begin with models for epidemics, showing how to calculate the basic reproduction number and the final size of the epidemic. We also study models with multiple compartments, including treatment or isolation of infectives. We then consider models including births and deaths in which there may be an endemic equilibrium and study the asymptotic stability of equilibria. We conclude by studying age of infection models which give a unifying framework for more complicated compartmental models.
97ab5bad794553f1af287d9ee88c0113e1ba80ed	We undertook enhanced surveillance of those presenting with respiratory symptoms at five healthcare centers by testing all symptomatic outpatients between November 2013 and January 2014 (winter time). Nasal swabs were collected from 182 patients and screened for MERS-CoV as well as other respiratory viruses using RT-PCR and multiplex microarray. A total of 75 (41.2%) of these patients had positive viral infection. MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples. Human rhinovirus (hRV) was the most detected pathogen (40.9%) followed by non-MERS-CoV human coronaviruses (19.3%), influenza (Flu) viruses (15.9%), and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) (13.6%). Viruses differed markedly depending on age in which hRV, Flu A, and hCoV-OC43 were more prevalent in adults and RSV, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-NL63 were mostly restricted to children under the age of 15. Moreover, coinfection was not uncommon in this study, in which 17.3% of the infected patients had dual infections due to several combinations of viruses. Dual infections decreased with age and completely disappeared in people older than 45 years. Our study confirms that MERS-CoV is not common in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia and shows high diversity and prevalence of other common respiratory viruses. This study also highlights the importance and contribution of enhanced surveillance systems for better infection control.
2abc8534c7ecfbc9a0c5fa1802316342b283ca08	Identifying the secondary structure of an RNA is crucial for understanding its diverse regulatory functions. This paper focuses on how to enhance target identification in a Boltzmann ensemble of structures via chemical probing data. We employ an information-theoretic approach to solve the problem, via considering a variant of the Rényi-Ulam game. Our framework is centered around the ensemble tree, a hierarchical bi-partition of the input ensemble, that is constructed by recursively querying about whether or not a base pair of maximum information entropy is contained in the target. These queries are answered via relating local with global probing data, employing the modularity in RNA secondary structures. We present that leaves of the tree are comprised of sub-samples exhibiting a distinguished structure with high probability. In particular, for a Boltzmann ensemble incorporating probing data, which is well established in the literature, the probability of our framework correctly identifying the target in the leaf is greater than 90%. Page 7 of 22 Li and Reidys Algorithms Mol Biol (2020) 15:15 complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(L · N · n 2 ) , i.e., quadratic with respect to the sequence length n, assuming the maximum level L and the ensemble size N are constants. Via indexing structures in and memorizing indices in k , Algorithm 1 requires O(N) memory on each level, i.e., its space complexity is O(L · N ).
790c6002db87c03cd6bdab85964c52808d09a218	Commonly used tests based on wild-type viruses, such as immunostaining, cannot meet the demands for rapid detection of viral replication, high-throughput screening for antivirals, as well as for tracking viral proteins or virus transport in real time. Notably, the development of replicating-competent reporter-expressing viruses (RCREVs) has provided an excellent option to detect directly viral replication without the use of secondary labeling, which represents a significant advance in virology. This article reviews the applications of RCREVs in diagnostic and molecular virology, including rapid neutralization tests, high-throughput screening systems, identification of viral receptors and virus-host interactions, dynamics of viral infections in vitro and in vivo, vaccination approaches and others. However, there remain various challenges associated with RCREVs, including pathogenicity alterations due to the insertion of a reporter gene, instability or loss of the reporter gene expression, or attenuation of reporter signals in vivo. Despite all these limitations, RCREVs have become powerful tools for both basic and applied virology with the development of new technologies for generating RCREVs, the inventions of novel reporters and the better understanding of regulation of viral replication.
b6ec6abbee6554d9503e381839c035f9730dfcb6	DNA can assemble into non-B form structures that stall replication and cause genomic instability. One such secondary structure results from an inverted DNA repeat that can assemble into hairpin and cruciform structures during DNA replication. Quasipalindromes (QP), imperfect inverted repeats, are sites of mutational hotspots. Quasipalindrome-associated mutations (QPMs) occur through a template-switch mechanism in which the replicative polymerase stalls at a QP site and uses the nascent strand as a template instead of the correct template strand. This mutational event causes the QP to become a perfect or more perfect inverted repeat. Since it is not fully understood how template-switch events are stimulated or repressed, we designed a high-throughput screen to discover drugs that affect these events. QP reporters were engineered in the Escherichia coli lacZ gene to allow us to study template-switch events specifically. We tested 700 compounds from the NIH Clinical Collection through a disk diffusion assay and identified 11 positive hits. One of the hits was azidothymidine (zidovudine, AZT), a thymidine analog and DNA chain terminator. The other ten were found to be fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which induce DNA-protein crosslinks. This work shows that our screen is useful in identifying small molecules that affect quasipalindrome-associated template-switch mutations. We are currently assessing more small molecule libraries and applying this method to study other types of mutations.
e0f75415777f21a9155772f75c4fbe5a0314ac6f	Background The COVID-19 pandemic confronts healthcare workers, including neurosurgeons, with difficult choices regarding which patients to treat. Methods In order to assist ethical triage, this article gives an overview of the main considerations and ethical principles relevant when allocating resources in times of scarcity. Results We discuss a framework employing four principles: prioritizing the worst off, maximizing benefits, treating patients equally, and promoting instrumental value. We furthermore discuss the role of age and comorbidity in triage and highlight some principles that may seem intuitive but should not form a basis for triage. Conclusions This overview is presented on behalf of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies and can be used as a toolkit for neurosurgeons faced with ethical dilemmas when triaging patients in times of scarcity.
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. However, little is currently known about the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, find that SARS-CoV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV S. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of SARS-CoV S but not SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions. Further studies using recovered SARS and COVID-19 patients' sera show limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1234567890():,; C oronaviruses (CoVs) infect human and animals and cause varieties of diseases, including respiratory, enteric, renal, and neurological diseases 1 . They are classified into four genera, alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV 2 . Since beginning of this century, there have already been three zoonotic outbreaks of beta-CoVs. In 2002-2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3,4 , a lineage B beta-CoV, emerged from bat and palm civet 5,6 , and infected over 8000 people and caused about 800 deaths 7 . In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a lineage C beta-CoV, was discovered as the causative agent of a severe respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia 8 , currently with 2494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths 9 , it remains endemic in Middle East, and dromedary camel is considered as the zoonotic reservoir host of MERS-CoV. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, was found in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China 10-12 . Viruses were isolated from patients and sequenced. Phylogenetical analysis revealed that it is a lineage B beta-CoV and closely related to a SARS-like (SL) CoV, RaTG13, discovered in a cave of Yunnan, China, in 2013 13 . They share about 96% nucleotide sequence identities, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might have emerged from a Bat SL-CoV. However, the intermediate host or whether there is an intermediate host remains to be determined. CoV uses its spike glycoprotein (S), a main target for neutralization antibody, to bind its receptor, and mediate membrane fusion and virus entry. Each monomer of trimeric S protein is about 180 kDa, and contains two subunits, S1 and S2, mediating attachment and membrane fusion, respectively. In the structure, N-and C-terminal portions of S1 fold as two independent domains, N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (C-domain) (Fig. 1a) . Depending on the virus, either NTD or Cdomain can serve as the receptor-binding domain (RBD). While RBD of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is located at the NTD 14 , most of other CoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV use C-domain to bind their receptors [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . MHV uses mouse carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEA-CAM1a) as the receptor 20 , and the receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) 21 and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) 22 , respectively. While S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 share about 76% and 97% of amino acid identities with SARS-CoV and RaTG13, respectively, the amino acid sequence of potential RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is only about 74% and 90.1% homologous to that of respectively. Recently, Zhou et al. 13 reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses hACE2 as the receptor. CoV S proteins are typical class I viral fusion proteins, and protease cleavage is required for activation of the fusion potential of S protein 23 . A two-step sequential protease cleavage model has been proposed for activation of S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 24,25 , priming cleavage between S1 and S2 and activating cleavage on S2' site. Depending on virus strains and cell types, CoV S proteins may be cleaved by one or several host proteases, including furin, trypsin, cathepsins, transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2), TMPRSS-4, or human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Availability of these proteases on target cells largely determines whether CoVs enter cells through plasma membrane or endocytosis. However, whether any of these proteases could promote virus entry of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive. In this study, using a lentiviral pseudotype system, we determine cell type susceptibility, virus receptor, entry pathway, and protease priming for SARS-CoV-2, and identify several potential drug targets for SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate limited cross-neutralization between convalescent sera from SARS and COVID-19 patients.
682c4ac2f50dff14002785ae077dd09130ab0965	 It is interesting to know the prevalence of such symptoms and how they were related to disease severity and prognosis.  In our study including 70 patients, anosmia and dysgeusia were present in half of COVID-19 patients.  The mean duration of anosmia was 7 days and the outcome seems favorable in less than 28 days. Background. New loss of smell or taste was not included as common symptoms of COVID-19 until March 2020 when the pandemic started in Western countries. We want to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Nord Franche-Comté Hospital, Trevenans, France, between March, 1 st and March, 14 th 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases. Of 70 patient enrolled, the mean age was 57.0 years and 29 patients (41%) were men. Median Charlson comorbidity index was 1.70(±2.5). Twenty-seven (39%) patients had pneumonia. Fatigue (93%[65]), cough (80%[55]) and fever (77%[54]) were the three main symptoms. Neurologic symptoms were present in more than half of the patients: anosmia (53%[37]) and dysgeusia (48%[34]). The mean duration of anosmia was 7.4 (±5, [1-21]) days, 51% (36/70) recovered before 28 days of evolution. Only one patient with anosmia had not recovered at the end of the follow-up. Patients with anosmia had less often a pneumonia (10/37 vs 17/33, p=0.036), were less often hospitalized (13/37 vs 20/33, p=0.033) and needed less often oxygen therapy (6/37 vs 17/33, p=0.002) than patients without anosmia. There were no statistically differences for viral load between patients with anosmia and patients without anosmia (5.5 [2.0-8.6] vs 5.3 [2.1-8.5] log copies/ml respectively, p=0.670). The fatality of COVID-19 in our study was 6% with four deaths. Anosmia and dysgeusia are present in half of COVID-19 patients. The mean duration of anosmia was 7 days and the outcome seems favorable in less than 28 days.
2cf9c120c360c2cfbafe7c855779e5270fa51509	An abnormal elevation in pressure is a serious complication involving the extracorporeal circulation circuit. Clot formation might be associated with this complication, but the precise mechanism of an abnormal elevation in pressure has not been identified. We investigated sufficient conditions for in-circuit elevation in pressure using an ex vivo re-circulation circuit with porcine blood. Specifically, we investigated the effect of blood conditions, the type of anticoagulation, and pro-inflammatory stimulation on in-circuit pressure. We also examined the cause of an abnormal elevation of in-circuit pressure by specifically degrading DNA, RNA, or protein components of an obstructed filter and by using immunofluorescent techniques. Neither a change in temperature nor change in pH in the blood increased in-circuit pressure. In contrast, long-term storage of blood, pro-inflammatory stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate, and heparin administration significantly increased in-circuit pressure. Abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure was associated with deposition of extracellular DnA on the outlet surface of the filter. Administration of DNase resulted in a rapid decline of in-circuit pressure. In an ex vivo re-circulation circuit system, extracellular DNA deposition on the filter is responsible for an abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure. Senescent leukocytes, stimulated leukocytes, and heparin exposure are associated with extracellular DnA deposition. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is important in maintaining the circulation and respiration during cardiac surgery. Abnormal elevation in pressure is a serious complication of CPB and has been reported in 0.03-4.3% cases of CPB 1-9 . This abnormal elevation in pressure has been termed abnormal inlet pressure elevation 1 , abnormal pressure gradient 2 , high-pressure excursion 3 , increased resistance in the oxygenator 4 , oxygenator failure 5,6 , increased internal pressure levels 7 , and oxygenator thrombosis 8 . Abnormal elevation in pressure may occur at three narrowed sections in CPB equipment, including the venous reservoir, oxygenator, and arterial line filter. Previous studies have suggested risk factors for an abnormal elevation in pressure in CPB, such as older age 2 , male sex 1,3 , coronary artery disease 1-3,10 , and polycythemia vera 11 . Hypothermia and alkalemia might also be associated with an abnormal elevation in pressure, although these factors are not sufficient by themselves 3,9 . Fibrin deposition inside CPB equipment might be involved in the underlying mechanism 1,2,6,9,10,12 . However, whether intensification of anticoagulation can ameliorate an abnormal elevation in pressure is unclear because most patients have already received a large amount of unfractionated heparin 1,2,11,12 . Therefore, the precise mechanism of an abnormal elevation in pressure during CPB is unknown. To determine the underlying mechanisms of an abnormal elevation in pressure during CPB, we developed an extracorporeal recirculation circuit in which in-circuit pressure could be monitored and a filter could be easily removed and analyzed. In this ex vivo circuit, we used a removable filter with a pore size of 40 µm because the pore sizes of a cardiotomy filter and arterial line filter in CPB equipment are approximately 40 µm, while the span open Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:474 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-57173-5 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of oxygenator fibers is approximately 50-250 µm. Using the ex vivo circuit system and porcine blood, we found that abnormal elevation of in-circuit pressure was associated with leukocyte activation or senescence in this study. Furthermore, we found that extracellular DNA deposition on the outlet of the filter was responsible for the abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure. (2020) 10:474 | https://doi.
7602ca90b8203e17ae00c585f57f04d6dc5e0b26	In times of crisis, identifying the essential needs is a crucial step to providing appropriate resources and services to affected entities. Social media platforms such as Twitter contain vast amount of information about the general public's needs. However, the sparsity of the information as well as the amount of noisy content present a challenge to practitioners to effectively identify shared information on these platforms. In this study, we propose two novel methods for two distinct but related needs detection tasks: the identification of 1) a list of resources needed ranked by priority, and 2) sentences that specify who-needs-what resources. We evaluated our methods on a set of tweets about the COVID-19 crisis. For task 1 (detecting top needs), we compared our results against two given lists of resources and achieved 64% precision. For task 2 (detecting who-needs-what), we compared our results on a set of 1,000 annotated tweets and achieved a 68% F1-score.
e367c185f028a3b59af2e04b387e2fc72656641b	This paper examines the relationship between biomedical policies and entrepreneurial R&D strategies. Public health programs have been unable to provide effective and affordable treatment of infectious diseases for the poor. While governments have become more open to private sector contributions to policy objectives, it is rare to find new ventures commercializing healthcare innovations for neglected diseases. Two case studies of entrepreneurial ventures, in the UK and China, provide evidence on how resource-constrained firms mobilize participants in policy-specific ecosystems to achieve their goals of new vaccine development for tuberculosis. Ecosystem analysis reveals how the innovators' business models can align their strategies with national policy objectives.
d7fe15c5d1b2c50f714e7322e707ebea2a4f7d8f	Objective: Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the interventions to reduce burnout of physicians and nurses have been published nowadays. This study aimed to summarize the evidence and clarify a bundled strategy to reduce burnout of physicians and nurses. Methods: Researches have been conducted within Cochrane Library, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, EBSCO, and CINAHL published from inception to 2019. In addition, a manual search for relevant articles was also conducted using Google Scholar and ancestral searches through the reference lists from articles included in the final review. Two reviewers independently selected and assessed, and any disagreements were resolved through a larger team discussion. A data extraction spreadsheet was developed and initially piloted in 3 randomly selected studies. Data from each study were extracted independently using a pre-standardized data abstraction form. The the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews and assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool were used to evaluate risk of bias and quality of included articles. Results: A total of 22 studies published from 2014 to 2019 were eligible for analysis. Previous studies have examined burnout among physicians (n = 9), nurses (n = 6) and healthcare providers (n = 7). The MBI was used by majority of studies to assess burnout. The included studies evaluated a wide range of interventions, individual-focused (emotion regulation, self-care workshop, yoga, massage, mindfulness, meditation, stress management skills and communication skills training), structural or organizational (workload or schedule-rotation, stress management training program, group face-to-face delivery, teamwork/transitions, Balint training, debriefing sessions and a focus group) and combine interventions (snoezelen, stress management and resiliency training, stress management workshop and improving interaction with colleagues through personal training). Based on the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews and AMSTAR 2 criteria, the risk of bias and methodological quality included studies was from moderate to high. Conclusions: Burnout is a complicated problem and should be dealt with by using bundled strategy. The existing overview clarified evidence to reduce burnout of physicians and nurses, which provided a basis for health policy makers or clinical managers to design simple and feasible strategies to reduce the burnout of physicians and nurses, and to ensure clinical safety. Abbreviations: AMSTAR 2 = assessment of multiple systematic reviews 2, RoB = risk of bias, ROBIS = the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews, SRs = systematic reviews.
0f8976b3ea4f96225f93d48176195bf47c177f78	One sentence summary: Two novel pertussis-toxin-like toxins are also present in the genome of the prophage that also encodes the LT-II enterotoxin genes in type II enterotoxigenic Escherichi coli. Editor: Teresa Frisan ABSTRACT Heat-labile enterotoxins (LT) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are structurally and functionally related to cholera toxin (CT). LT-I toxins are plasmid-encoded and flanked by IS elements, while LT-II toxins of type II ETEC are chromosomally encoded with flanking genes that appear phage related. Here, I determined the complete genomic sequence of the locus for the LT-IIa type strain SA53, and show that the LT-IIa genes are encoded by a 51 239 bp lambdoid prophage integrated at the rac locus, the site of a defective prophage in E. coli K12 strains. Of 50 LT-IIa and LT-IIc, 46 prophages also encode one member of two novel two-gene ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin families that are both related to pertussis toxin, which I named eplBA or ealAB, respectively. The eplBA and ealAB genes are syntenic with the Shiga toxin loci in their lambdoid prophages of the enteric pathogen enterohemorrhagic E. coli. These novel AB 5 toxins show pertussis-toxin-like activity on tissue culture cells, and like pertussis toxin bind to sialic acid containing glycoprotein ligands. Type II ETEC are the first mucosal pathogens known to simultaneously produce two ADP-ribosylating toxins predicted to act on and modulate activity of both stimulatory and inhibitory alpha subunits of host cell heterotrimeric G-proteins.

This work presents mEBAL 1 , a multimodal database for eye blink detection and attention level estimation. The eye blink frequency is related to the cognitive activity and automatic detectors of eye blinks have been proposed for many tasks including attention level estimation, analysis of neuro-degenerative diseases, deception recognition, drive fatigue detection, or face anti-spoofing. However, most existing databases and algorithms in this area are limited to experiments involving only a few hundred samples and individual sensors like face cameras. The proposed mEBAL improves previous databases in terms of acquisition sensors and samples. In particular, three different sensors are simultaneously considered: Near Infrared (NIR) and RGB cameras to capture the face gestures and an Electroencephalography (EEG) band to capture the cognitive activity of the user and blinking events. Regarding the size of mEBAL, it comprises 6,000 samples and the corresponding attention level from 38 different students while conducting a number of e-learning tasks of varying difficulty. In addition to presenting mEBAL, we also include preliminary experiments on: i) eye blink detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the facial images, and ii) attention level estimation of the students based on their eye blink frequency.
04370cab067c5371a34c90e8f7551926466a6290	BACKGROUND Most articles describing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurosurgical services have been from developed countries. We attempt to report our experience in carrying out neurosurgical services in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during the time of the pandemic. METHODS To collect information on the effect of the pandemic in Indonesia and Yogyakarta, we gathered data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health online database for the national data and local government records for the local data (including records of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery). RESULTS Compared to other countries, Indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of COVID-19. To raise the understanding of the natural history of the pandemic, we grouped the period into four different phases: Phase 1 (there was confirmed cases in Indonesia but no cases found in Yogyakarta), Phase 2 (the first case in Yogyakarta detected), Phase 3 (the time when the cumulative cases surpass its peak), and Phase 4 (the pandemic ends). At the time of this writing, we were still in Phase 2 and in this phase, we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures, from an average of 4 to 2.4 procedures per week. Moreover, the number of elective operations dropped from an average of 12 to 9 procedures per week. CONCLUSIONS A pandemic, such as COVID-19, reduces both inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical activities. A comprehensive plan can improve both utilization and safety of the neurosurgical staff.
a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	Estimation of the inner state of volcanoes are important for understanding the mechanism of eruption and reduction of disaster risk. With the improvement in observation networks, data assimilation of internal magma state using time-history crustal deformation data observed at the surface is expected to be suitable for solving such problems. Using finite-element methods capable of modeling complex geometry is desirable for modeling the three-dimensional heterogeneous crust structure, and nonlinear time-history analysis is required for considering the change in material properties due to the movement of magma. Thus, many cases of large-scale finite-element analysis is required, and the computational cost incurred is expected to become a bottleneck. As a basic study towards data assimilation of internal magma state considering change in material properties of the crust, we demonstrated that many case analyses of volcano deformation problems can be conducted in a reasonable time frame by development of a crustal deformation analysis method accelerated by GPUs. For verification of the data assimilation method, we estimated the magma trend in an actual threedimensional heterogeneous crust structure without temporal change in material properties. We confirmed that the magma movement trend can be reproduced using the model considering crust heterogeneity, while models disregarding three-dimensional crust structure resulted in wrong estimations. Thus, we can see that using finite-element methods capable of modeling three-dimensional heterogeneity for crustal deformation analysis is important for accurate magma state estimation.
dfb61605f5d8333e22c083506c683dcc07ce6601	Emerging and re-emerging infections and possible bioterrorism acts will continue to challenge both the medical community and civilian populations worldwide, urging health authorities to respond rapidly and effectively. Established in 2005, the European Community (EC)-funded European Network of Biosafety-Level-4 laboratories (Euronet-P4), which brings together the laboratories in Porton Down, London, Hamburg, Marburg, Solna, Lyon and Rome, seeks to increase international collaboration in the areas of high containment laboratory biosafety and viral diagnostic capability, to strengthen Europe's capacity to respond to an infectious disease emergency, and to offer assistance to countries not equipped with such costly facilities. Network partners have agreed on a common strategy to fill the gaps identified in the field of risk group-4 agents' laboratory diagnosis, namely the lack of standardization and of reference samples. The network has received a further 3-year funding, to offer assistance to external laboratories, and to start the planning of field activities.
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents of various tumours such as cervical cancer. HPV binding to the cell surface of keratinocytes leads to virus endocytosis at tetraspanin enriched microdomains. Complex interactions of the capsid proteins with host proteins as well as ADAM17-dependent ERK1/2 signal transduction enable the entry platform assembly of the oncogenic HPV type 16. Here, we studied the importance of tetraspanin CD9, also known as TSPAN29, in HPV16 infection of different epithelial cells. We found that both overexpression and loss of the tetraspanin decreased infection rates in cells with low endogenous CD9 levels, while reduction of CD9 expression in keratinocytes that exhibit high-CD9 protein amounts, led to an increase of infection. Therefore, we concluded that low-CD9 supports infection. Moreover, we found that changes in CD9 amounts affect the shedding of the ADAM17 substrate transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) and the downstream phosphorylation of ERK. These effects correlate with those on infection rates suggesting that a specific CD9 optimum promotes ADAM17 activity, ERK signalling and virus infection. Together, our findings implicate that CD9 regulates HPV16 infection through the modulation of ADAM17 sheddase activity.
c504d9c3d10546a02fd574211e5f5bb75ca46794	The hypothesis that the expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs) protein is regulated at the level of transcription and that PAR isoforms, PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3, and PAR-4, in lung tissue show different patterns of expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) was tested. Male Wistar rats were rendered endotoxemic by intra-peritoneal injection of LPS (15 mg/kg body weight). We examined the expression of protein and mRNA and the immunohistochemical localization of PAR isoforms in lung tissues 1, 3, 6, and 10 h after LPS administration. Induction of ALI by LPS was confirmed based on histopathological changes. LPS administration induced significant increases in the expression of PAR isoforms (protein) at the level of transcription in ALI. While the time course of PAR-1 and -2 expressions were different, those of PAR-3 and -4 were almost similar. An immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of PAR isoforms in the vascular endothelium, alveolar epithelium, and alveolar macrophages. However, the cellular distribution patterns of PAR isoforms were different. We conclude that LPS induces increase in protein expression of PAR isoforms at the level of transcription in rats with ALI. The differential expression patterns (over a time course) and distribution of PAR isoforms suggests a distinct role for each isoform in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI.
3e0d87afadeece79c5d75aa3a2821af94f1608f6	This article discusses the potential ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on waste and 10 wastewater services, focusing on critical points where alternative operating procedures or 11 additional mitigation measures may be advisable. Key concerns are (i) the long half-life of 12 the virus on materials such as waste containers, bags, and in wastewater, and (ii) possible 13 transmission via contaminated waste surfaces and aerosols from wastewater systems. There 14 are opportunities to further the science of wastewater-based epidemiology by monitoring 15 viral RNA in wastewater to assess disease prevalence and spread in defined populations, 16 which may prove beneficial for informing COVID-19 related public health policy.
5512afdb48d03f4782659e29ab8fb025ac7cea00	Background: The influenza-related burden remains high and the COVID-19 pandemic may difficult its accurate surveillance. This study aimed to evaluate the performance, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, of the case definition of suspected influenza used in community surveillance in Mexico. A cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study took place and cases fulfilling the suspected case criteria (n = 20, 511), and with laboratory-conclusive evidence (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) to confirm or discard influenza virus infection, were analyzed. Results: A high sensitivity and modest specificity was documented, and this later decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as its diagnostic accuracy. However, no significant differences were observed in the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics among the analyzed periods. Conclusions: The evaluated case definition remains to be a cost-effective alternative to identify patients who may benefit from influenza-specific antiviral drugs, even during the COVID-19 global outbreak.
d4d5a0ff5c2b48d6839eaf3ff6259a4cefb8cff6	The scoping review was undertaken to outline the vulnerabilities of Pakistan's public health and healthcare system, which put the population at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated morbidity and mortality. The major electronic databases were searched using both "text words" and "thesaurus terms," focusing on viral infections, COVID-19 and healthcare systems in Pakistan. The content of the selected articles was analyzed by using thematic approach. Out of the total 171 potentially relevant citations, 24 articles were included in the data synthesis. We found that the recent COVID-19 outbreak is a major threat to Pakistan's public health and healthcare system, and the country is not in a position to control spread of disease and provide required standards of care deemed necessary by the World Health Organization. A number of intertwined reasons that expose the Pakistani population at increased risk of COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality, include public related demurrals, healthcare workforce related demurrals, organizational and regulatory voids, and travel patterns. To cope with the upsurge of COVID-19 in Pakistan, the regulators need to re-examine and recognize deficiencies in the healthcare system, and thereafter reinforce core capacities in workforce and monetary resources, surveillance, laboratory
1f7d12535c961aa81e3719db27546b741674c1aa	The avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of the respiratory disease infectious bronchitis of domestic fowl, and is controlled by routine vaccination. To explore the potential use of IBV as a vaccine vector a reverse genetics system was utilised to generate infectious recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) expressing the reporter genes enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or humanised Renilla luciferase (hRluc). Infectious rIBVs were obtained following the replacement of Gene 5 or the intergenic region (IR) with eGFP or hRluc, or the replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b with hRluc. The replacement of Gene 5 with an IBV codon-optimised version of the hRluc gene also resulted in successful rescue of infectious rIBV. Reporter gene expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, or luciferase activity assays, for all successfully rescued rIBVs following infection of primary chick kidney (CK) cells. The genetic stability of rIBVs was analysed by serial passage on CK cells. Recombinant IBV stability varied depending on the genome region being replaced, with the reporter genes maintained up to at least passage 8 (P8) following replacement of Gene 5, P7 for replacement of the IR and P5 for replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b. Codon-optimisation of the hRluc gene, when replacing Gene 5, resulted in an increase in genome stability, with hRluc expression stable up to P10 compared to P8 for standard hRluc. Repeated passaging of rIBVs expressing hRluc at an MOI of 0.01 demonstrated an increase in stability, with hRluc expression stable up to at least P12 following the replacement of Gene 5. This study has demonstrated that heterologous genes can be incorporated into, and expressed from a range of IBV genome locations and that replacement of accessory Gene 5 offers a promising target for realising the potential of IBV as a vaccine vector for other avian pathogens.

371fb4ba22e791bef830b7c75b23aff6152d3455	The therapeutic options for patients whose Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL) relapses following bone marrow transplantation are limited. We are currently developing an adoptive immunotherapy protocol for these patients based on the in vitro expansion of leukaemia-specific T cells by dendritic cells (DC) derived from CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells. In these experiments we used a cytokine-enriched serum-free medium to expand DC from purified CD34+ stem cells from cord blood, a medium which can also be used to generate DC from bone marrow or mobilised peripheral blood CD34+ cells. Following optimisation of the medium we investigated conditions for RNA loading of the DC as this has been shown to be an effective means of generating immune responses to tumour antigens. In vitro-transcribed (IVT) enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) mRNA was used as a model protein to optimise variables affecting transfection efficiency by electroporation. Flow cytometry analysis of eGFP expression in the whole culture and in the CD11c+DR+ fraction (designated as the DC fraction in these cultures) allowed comparison of variables (cuvette size, cell concentration, voltage, capacitance and electroporation medium) affecting cell viability and transfection efficiency. We further investigated pre-and post-electroporation conditions including incubation times and exposure of cells to different temperature environments. Using our optimal conditions we achieved 91% eGFP transfection efficiency with 90% cell viability of the whole culture, and 93% of the DC expressing eGFP. Cord blood CD34+derived DC electroporated with flu matrix protein mRNA under the optimal conditions were able to present antigen and be killed by flu specific CD8 CTL clone. Adult monocytederived DC similarly transfected with the flu protein were able to amplify tetramer-positive autologous CD8 CTL in vitro. These findings will now be extended to expand leukaemia-specific CTL for adoptive immunotherapy.
22874791a5bdba52d0d9c47550804b0ab8bb5651	Thanks to their strong immunostimulating properties and safety for humans, plant viruses represent an appropriate basis for the design of novel vaccines. The coat protein of Alternanthera mosaic virus can form virus-like particles that are stable under physiological conditions and have adjuvant properties. This work presents a recombinant human rotavirus A antigen based on the epitope of rotavirus structural protein VP6, using Alternanthera mosaic virus coat protein as a carrier. An expression vector containing the gene of Alternanthera mosaic virus (MU strain) coat protein fused to the epitope of rotavirus protein VP6 was designed. Immunoblot analysis showed that the chimeric protein was effectively recognized by commercial polyclonal antibodies to rotavirus and therefore is a suitable candidate for development of a vaccine prototype. Interaction of the chimeric recombinant protein with the native coat protein of Alternanthera mosaic virus and its RNA resulted in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes that were recognized by antirotavirus antibodies.
abc737ee2a64816e774988f6abde381a0650b9f6	The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented health and economic impact, but currently there are no approved therapies. We have isolated an antibody, EY6A, from a late-stage COVID-19 patient and show it neutralises SARS-CoV-2 and cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-1. EY6A Fab binds tightly (KD of 2 nM) the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike glycoprotein and a 2.6Å crystal structure of an RBD/EY6A Fab complex identifies the highly conserved epitope, away from the ACE2 receptor binding site. Residues of this epitope are key to stabilising the pre-fusion Spike. Cryo-EM analyses of the pre-fusion Spike incubated with EY6A Fab reveal a complex of the intact trimer with three Fabs bound and two further multimeric forms comprising destabilized Spike attached to Fab. EY6A binds what is probably a major neutralising epitope, making it a candidate therapeutic for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 resulting in a pandemic with an estimated 5-6 % mortality rate 1 . Akin to SARS-CoV-1, the causative agent of the 2003 SARS outbreak, this is an enveloped beta-coronavirus with protrusions of large trimeric 'Spike' proteins. Receptor binding domains (RBD) located at the tip of these Spikes facilitate host cell entry via interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Spikes are type I transmembrane glycoproteins, formed from a single polypeptide, which transitions into a post-fusion state via cleavage into S1 (N-terminal) and S2 (C-terminal) chains following receptor binding or trypsin treatment. In the pre-fusion state, the apical RBD (~22 kDa) is folded down enshrouded by the N-terminal domain of the Spike so that the receptor binding site is inaccessible until, it is assumed, an RBD stochastically swings upwards to present the ACE2 binding site 2-5 . ACE2 interaction locks the RBD in the 'up' conformation which drives
c66d7cf6243be684d42751e19f4f9c27ca8a1f3b	Using peptide nanoparticle technology, we have designed two novel vaccine constructs representing M2e in monomeric (Mono-M2e) and tetrameric (Tetra-M2e) forms. Groups of specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were immunized intramuscularly with Mono-M2e or Tetra-M2e with and without an adjuvant. Two weeks after the second boost, chickens were challenged with 107.2 EID50 of H5N2 low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus. M2e-specific antibody responses to each of the vaccine constructs were tested by ELISA. Vaccinated chickens exhibited increased M2e-specific IgG responses for each of the constructs as compared to a non-vaccinated group. However, the vaccine construct Tetra-M2e elicited a significantly higher antibody response when it was used with an adjuvant. On the other hand, virus neutralization assays indicated that immune protection is not by way of neutralizing antibodies. The level of protection was evaluated using quantitative real time PCR at 4, 6, and 8 days postchallenge with H5N2 LPAI by measuring virus shedding from trachea and cloaca. The Tetra-M2e with adjuvant offered statistically significant (P < 0.05 ) protection against subtype H5N2 LPAI by reduction of the AI virus shedding. The results suggest that the self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle shows promise as a potential platform for a development of a vaccine against AI.
0bc0686cfdd5c500fd915b83aec16a6947446754	Background. Intravenous zanamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor suitable for treatment of hospitalized patients with severe influenza. Methods. Patients were treated with intravenous zanamivir 600 mg twice daily, adjusted for renal impairment, for up to 10 days. Primary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), and clinical/laboratory parameters. Pharmacokinetics, viral load, and disease course were also assessed. Results. One hundred thirty patients received intravenous zanamivir (median, 5 days; range, 1-11) a median of 4.5 days (range, 1-7) after onset of influenza; 83% required intensive care. The most common influenza type/ subtype was A/H1N1pdm09 (71%). AEs and serious AEs were reported in 85% and 34% of patients, respectively; serious AEs included bacterial pulmonary infections (8%), respiratory failure (7%), sepsis or septic shock (5%), and cardiogenic shock (5%). No drug-related trends in safety parameters were identified. Protocol-defined liver events were observed in 13% of patients. The 14-and 28-day all-cause mortality rates were 13% and 17%. No fatalities were considered zanamivir related. Pharmacokinetic data showed dose adjustments for renal impairment yielded similar zanamivir exposures. Ninety-three patients, positive at baseline for influenza by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, showed a median decrease in viral load of 1.42 log 10 copies/mL after 2 days of treatment. Conclusions. Safety, pharmacokinetic and clinical outcome data support further investigation of intravenous zanamivir. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01014988.
1090afa5b76644ce9e3be9d9d0e67ad651f846d9	Viral infections are an important cause of death worldwide. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of antiviral drugs or vaccines for a large number of viruses, and this represents a remarkable challenge particularly for emerging and re-emerging viruses. For this reason, the identification of broad spectrum antiviral compounds provides a valuable opportunity for developing efficient antiviral therapies. Here we report on a class of rhodanine and thiobarbituric derivatives displaying a broad spectrum antiviral activity against seven different enveloped viruses including an HSV-2 acyclovir resistant strain with favorable selectivity indexes. Due to their selective action on enveloped viruses and to their lipid oxidation ability, we hypothesize a mechanism on the viral envelope that affects the fluidity of the lipid bilayer, thus compromising the efficiency of virus-cell fusion and preventing viral entry.
33b1bdefe8b1987545c64145e777fb73d0837111	Agro-industrial waste is a largely untapped natural resource of bioactive compounds including carotenoids and pectin. However, conventional solvent extraction involves the excessive use of organic solvents, costly equipment, and tedious operation. These limitations of conventional extraction methods could be prospectively overcome by the carotenoid-pectin hydrocolloidal complexation. The complexation of lycopene and pectin was efficiently promoted in an aqueous environment, resulting in the colloidal complexes that can be subsequently recovered by sedimentation or centrifugation. In this study, the potential of carotenoid-pectin complexation on tomato pomace containing carotenoids and pectin was evaluated. Tomato pomace is a rich source of lycopene, β-carotene as well as pectin, making it suitable as the raw material for the carotenoid extraction. The extraction of carotenoid and pectin from tomato pomace was optimized using response surface methodology. The maximum recovery was 9.43 mg carotenoid fractions/100 g tomato pomace, while the purity of carotenoid-rich fractions was 92%. The antioxidant capacity of carotenoids extracted from the complexation method was found to be higher than that from the solvent extraction method. Moreover, extraction yield and antioxidant capacity of carotenoid obtained from the carotenoid-pectin complexation were comparable to that from solvent extraction. The carotenoid-pectin complexation is a promising green approach to valorize agro by-products for the extraction of valuable carotenoids.
766d97be33f36348cbf737ef36b4c41e200d74f3	Purpose The first aim of this paper is to provide dental professionals caring for children and adolescents during and after the COVID-19 pandemic with a reference to international dental guidelines. The second aim is to suggest minimally invasive treatment alternatives for caries management, minimising the risk of viral cross-infection and offering a safer clinical environment. Methods An evidence-based pertinent literature search of different electronic databases was performed in addition to leading global dental authorities, royal colleges, and programmes. Results All guidelines released in response to COVID-19 centred around minimising Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGP) impacting the provision of regular dental treatment of paediatric patients. There was an emphasis on triaging and only treating emergency and urgent cases. Special attention was given to medically compromised children in the guidelines. Detailed guidelines for the dental environment and equipment were given. This paper also summarised the relevant evidence-based guidelines for the use of non-invasive and minimally invasive caries management techniques. Conclusion Specific recommendations for dental management of paediatric patients during and in the post-COVID-19 era are suggested. Minimisation of AGP procedures, and case-based selection of biological, non-invasive or minimally invasive methods are recommended.
bf2c7d9dace90947f1eb116186569036bd0bcba4	We read with great interest the study by Siyu Chen and colleagues. The authors evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of five pregnant patients with COVID-19 at term, whose delivery was uneventful and led to favorable perinatal outcomes for both mother and neonate. We would like to draw attention to a growing body of evidence that now points towards an under-addressed association between preterm maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, preterm delivery and adverse neonatal outcomes, which is not reflected in Chen et al.'s small cohort. We also stress that vertical transmission, which was not tested for by Chen et al., should not be excluded as a potential mechanism for viral spread. Centers should therefore be meticulous in their approach to a SARS-CoV-2+ pregnancy to optimize clinical outcomes for both mother and child.
dd3181abc5788f396072c06ca7f0d8af90e9b932	The aim of this study was to examine association between IFNL4 gene ss469415590 and treatment efficiency in group of Ukrainian PEG-interferon/ribavirin-treated chronic hepatitis C patients. Study group consisted of 92 unrelated hepatitis C virus genotype 1 mono-infected patients: case group -29 patients with late or absent virological response; control group -63 patients with sustained virological response. Study material was genomic DNA. Genotyping was performed using amplification-refractory mutation system PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using GenePop and OpenEpi statistical packages. Obtained results show that ss469415590 ΔG/ΔG genotype is associated with poor virological response (OR = 3.62; CI 95%: 1.12-11.67) in PEG-interferon/ribavirin-treated chronic hepatitis C patients from Ukraine.
e0c2203aa11f63d79d6aa30020c651bc571cea7c	In the 100 years since their discovery, retroviruses have played a special role in virology and in molecular biology. These agents have been at the center of cancer research and shaped our understanding of cell growth, differentiation and survival in ways that stretch far beyond investigations using these viruses. The discovery of retroviral oncogenes established the central paradigm that altered cellular genes can provide a dominant signal initiating cancer development. Their unique replication mechanism and their integration into cellular DNA allow these viruses to alter the properties of their hosts beyond the life span of the infected individual and contribute to the evolution of species. This same property has made retroviral vectors an important tool for gene therapy. Indeed, the impact of retrovirus research has been far-reaching and despite the amazing progress that has been made, retroviruses continue to reveal new insights into the host -pathogen interaction.

Apprehension exists about premature neonates' ability to self-regulate breath size. This study describes peak pressure and tidal volume distribution of neonates on NAVA and non-invasive NAVA. This is a retrospective study of stored ventilator data with exploratory analysis. Summary statistics were calculated. Distributional assessment of peak pressure and tidal volume were evaluated, overall and per NAVA level. Over 1 million breaths were evaluated from 56 subjects. Mean peak pressure was 16.4 ± 6.4 in the NAVA group, and 15.8 ± 6.4 in the NIV-NAVA group (t test, p < 0.001). Mean tidal volume was 3.5 ± 2.7 ml/kg. Conclusion:In neonates on NAVA, most pressures and volumes were within or lower than recommended ranges with pressure-limited or volume-guarantee ventilation. What is known: • Limiting peak inspiratory pressures or tidal volumes are the main strategies to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury in neonates. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist allows neonates to regulate their own peak inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes on a breath-to-breath basis using neural feedback. What is new: • When neonates chose the size of their breaths based on neural feedback, the majority of peak inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes were within or lower than the recommended peak inspiratory pressure or tidal volume ranges with pressure-limited or volume guarantee ventilation.

791f1dbef4633d6ec6164d5e6d6cfe3d4b23e284	Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. The burden of TB is alarmingly high in developing countries, where diagnosis latent TB infection (LTBI), Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), HIV-associated TB, and paediatric TB is still a challenge. This is mainly due to delayed or misdiagnosis of TB, which continues to fuel its worldwide epidemic. The ideal diagnostic test is still unavailable, and conventional methods remain a necessity for TB diagnosis, though with poor diagnostic ability. The nanoparticles have shown potential for the improvement of drug delivery, reducing treatment frequency and diagnosis of various diseases. The engineering of antigens/antibody nanocarriers represents an exciting front in the field of diagnostics, potentially flagging the way toward development of better diagnostics for TB. This chapter discusses the presently available tests for TB diagnostics and also highlights the recent advancement in the nanotechnology-based detection tests for M. tuberculosis.
54b8f29a0d6dff2cbe18649bf919765b94809ac0	Coronavirus disease 2019 is an infection caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which was identified in Wuhan, China. The race is on globally to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 and develop a safe and effective vaccine against the disease. There is an urgent need to search for effective remedies against COVID-19 from the rich and extensive flora of Africa and the world. A literature search was conducted to obtain information on drugs with the potential for effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 based mostly on outcomes of preclinical studies and a few clinical investigations. This was considered important to this perspective as some of the identified mechanisms of action may be related to potential anti-COVID-19 actions of phytomedicines. The findings from the literature search were also used to establish the need for exploration of phytomedicines in the fight against COVID-19. This perspective identifies the need to preserve the rich tradition of herbal medicine in Africa, repositioning it by inculcating all aspects of discovery, development, and chemical evaluation of pharmaceuticals from medicinal plants for effective management of prevalent diseases. The identified mechanisms of action of current drugs under consideration for the treatment of COVID-19 include preventing fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with human cells; decrease acidity in endosomes, cell membrane-derived vesicles for transportation of the virus within the host cell and within which the virus can replicate; and blockade of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Phytomedicines may possibly elicit either one or a combination of these effects. The case for the exploration of phytomedicines against COVID-19 is strengthened by the emergence of a number of conventional drugs from medicinal plants and the emergence of botanicals with proven efficacy for some medical conditions. Caution against indiscriminate use of medicinal plants in the guise of treating COVID-19 has been highlighted and the need for reliable preclinical and clinical studies.
f0e81bd1111037db25cbfabb9ba2722ae340ea32	We have performed full-field cryo X-ray microscopy in the water window photon energy range on vaccinia virus (VACV) infected cells to produce tomographic reconstructions. PtK2 cells were infected with a GFP-expressing VACV strain and frozen by plunge fast freezing. The infected cells were selected by light fluorescence microscopy of the GFP marker and subsequently imaged in the X-ray microscope under cryogenic conditions. Tomographic tilt series of X-ray images were used to yield three-dimensional reconstructions showing different cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, filaments), together with other structures derived from the virus infection. Among them, it was possible to detect viral factories and two types of viral particles related to different maturation steps of VACV (immature and mature particles), which were compared to images obtained by standard electron microscopy of the same type of cells. In addition, the effect of radiation damage during X-ray tomographic acquisition was analyzed. Thin sections studied by electron microscopy revealed that the morphological features of the cells do not present noticeable changes after irradiation. Our findings show that cryo X-ray nano-tomography is a powerful tool for collecting three-dimensional structural information from frozen, unfixed, unstained whole cells with sufficient resolution to detect different virus particles exhibiting distinct maturation levels.
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, excess mortality has been reported, while hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular events reduced. Brazil is the second country with more deaths due to COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate excess cardiovascular mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in 6 Brazilian capital cities. Methods: Using the Civil Registry public database, we evaluated total and cardiovascular excess deaths, further stratified in ACS, stroke and unspecified cardiovascular deaths in the 6 Brazilian cities with greater number of COVID-19 deaths (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Recife, Belém, Manaus). We compared data from epidemiological weeks 12 to 22 of 2020, with the same period in 2019. We also compared the number of hospital and home deaths during the period. Results: There were 69,328 deaths and 17,877 COVID-19 deaths in the studied period and cities for 2020. Cardiovascular mortality increased in most cities, with greater magnitude in the Northern capitals. However, while there was a reduction in ACS and stroke in the most developed cities, the Northern capitals showed an increase of these events. For unspecified cardiovascular deaths, there was a marked increase in all cities, which strongly correlated to the rise in home deaths (r=0.86, p=0.01). The excess cardiovascular mortality was greater in the less developed cities, possibly associated with healthcare collapse. ACS and stroke deaths decreased in the most developed cities, in parallel with an increase in unspecified cardiovascular and home deaths, presumably as a result of misdiagnosis. Conversely, ACS and stroke deaths increased in cities with a healthcare collapse.

From such experiments, important constraints on the protein or peptide conformation can be derived. Specifically, our aim is to localize an iodine-labelled phenylalanine in the SARS E protein, incorporated in DMPC phospholipid bilayers, which are deposited in the form of thick multilamellar stacks on silicon surfaces. Here, we discuss the experimental aspects and the difficulties associated with the Fourier synthesis analysis that gives the electron density profile of the membranes. r
d127e9fa7bcad289c4435d88c3e779ec46dd6de0	Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes epidemic fever, rash and polyarthralgia in Africa and Asia. Although it is known since the 1950s, new epidemiological and clinical features reported during the recent outbreak in the Indian Ocean can be regarded as the emergence of a new disease. Numerous severe forms of the infection have been described that put emphasis on the lack of efficient antiviral therapy. Among the virus-encoded enzymes, nsP2 constitutes an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. It is a multifunctional protein of approximately 90 kDa with a helicase motif in the N-terminal portion of the protein while the papain-like protease activity resides in the C-terminal portion. The nsP2 proteinase is an essential enzyme whose proteolytic activity is critical for virus replication. In this work, a recombinant CHIKV nsP2pro and a C-terminally truncated variant were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by metal-chelate chromatography. The enzymatic properties of the proteinase were then determined using specific synthetic fluorogenic substrates. This study constitutes the first characterization of a recombinant CHIKV nsP2 cysteine protease, which may be useful for future drug screening.
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	Background: A33 is a type II integral membrane protein expressed on the extracellular enveloped form of vaccinia virus (VACV). Passive transfer of A33-directed monoclonal antibodies or vaccination with an A33 subunit vaccine confers protection against lethal poxvirus challenge in animal models. Homologs of A33 are highly conserved among members of the Orthopoxvirus genus and are potential candidates for inclusion in vaccines or assays targeting extracellular enveloped virus activity. One monoclonal antibody directed against VACV A33, MAb-1G10, has been shown to target a conformation-dependent epitope. Interestingly, while it recognizes VACV A33 as well as the corresponding variola homolog, it does not bind to the monkeypox homolog. In this study, we utilized a random phage display library to investigate the epitope recognized by MAb-1G10 that is critical for facilitating cell-to-cell spread of the vaccinia virus. Results: By screening with linear or conformational random phage libraries, we found that phages binding to MAb-1G10 display the consensus motif CEPLC, with a disulfide bond formed between two cysteine residues required for MAb-1G10 binding. Although the phage motif contained no linear sequences homologous to VACV A33, structure modeling and analysis suggested that residue D115 is important to form the minimal epitope core. A panel of point mutants expressing the ectodomain of A33 protein was generated and analyzed by either binding assays such as ELISA and immunoprecipitation or a functional assessment by blocking MAb-1G10 mediated comet inhibition in cell culture. Conclusions: These results confirm L118 as a component of the MAb-1G10 binding epitope, and further identify D115 as an essential residue. By defining the minimum conformational structure, as well as the conformational arrangement of a short peptide sequence recognized by MAb-1G10, these results introduce the possibility of designing small molecule mimetics that may interfere with the function of A33 in vivo. This information will also be useful for designing improved assays to evaluate the potency of monoclonal and polyclonal products that target A33 or A33-modulated EV dissemination.
b9e7e99d058c1fffd687046fe2999ebdba9edd65	Regulations are a part of life but who writes them, what is the basis on which they are written and when the regulations get it wrong, whose fault is it? Is it those who wrote the regulations, those enforcing the regulations, those being regulated or the science underpinning the regulations? In seeking answers to these questions, this paper explores the regulatory process and the contribution of science. It takes as examples the role of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) in regulating veterinary products, of the Security Sensitive Biological Agents regulations in managing the risks from specific pathogens, the Quarantine Act regulations as applied to containment facilities and the development of welfare standards. By dealing with products, pathogens, places and ''pets'' it provides a broad oversight of how regulations have been developed and applied from different perspectives and highlights the differing roles that science and research play both in developing policy and regulations. What is clear is that in the presence of good science it is usually possible to develop sound and defensible regulations e.g. those managed by APVMA, but when there is a lack of science to underpin the regulations, problems can arise e.g. in the case of animal welfare.
0c511b038d99327b33d8db5305ff69ecd2fe764e	In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China. 1,2 Epidemiological and clinical characteristics, risk factors for mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and risk factors in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 included age and chronic disease have been reported. 3-6 However, the use of biological markers to predict the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 has not been well described. So far, only one study has reported that ABO blood groups were associated with the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2Á 7 In the present study, after eliminating other confounding risk factors (including age, gender and comorbidities), we further investigated and confirmed the association of ABO blood groups and risk of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in patients from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, as well as two hospitals in Wuhan, China. Patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 who died or were discharged between February 1 and March 25, 2020, were included in this retrospective cohort study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the need for informed consent was waived. 8 Epidemiological information, clinical data, underlying comorbidities, CT images of lungs, laboratory findings and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. The blood group distribution data of the other two hospitals (Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University) and healthy controls in Wuhan came from the paper published online. 7 Data were expressed as percentages (%). We used chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests in order to compare the various groups. The ABO blood group in 265 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from the Central Hospital of Wuhan showed a distribution of 39Á3 %, 25Á3 %, 9Á8 % and 25Á7 % for A, B, AB and O, respectively (Table I ). The proportion of blood group A in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (39Á3 % vs. 32Á3 %, P = 0Á017), 7 while the proportion of blood group O in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (25Á7 % vs. 33Á8 %, P < 0Á01). We next investigated whether age, gender and chronic disease influence the ABO blood group distribution (Table I) . The results showed that, among blood group A (43Á6 % vs. 32Á2 % in controls, P < 0Á01) and blood group O (22Á2 % vs. 33Á8 % in controls, P < 0Á01), patients over 60 years of age were consistent with all the above patients. Similarly, we Conceived and designed the experiments:
53722962eaf42a4952fd57a350e8314ec0662eb0	In December 2019, a new severe respiratory coronavirus infection was detected and has since spread across the globe to be ultimately declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. For physicians and allied medical professionals, the period since has been marked by an increased and rapidly changing flow of information from multiple regional, national and international health authorities, regulating bodies and professional associations. Although social media platforms have an active presence in the instant dissemination of information and medical professionals display active participation in them, traditional channels such as email are still being emphasized as a means of communication. This article discusses the opportunities offered by social media platforms such as Facebook, Reddit and TikTok to disseminate medical information both for the use of physicians and as a means to communicate essential information to the public at large. En décembre 2019, une nouvelle infection respiratoire au coronavirus (COVID-19) a été détecté et s'est propagé, depuis ce temps, à travers le globe, jusqu'à être ultimement déclarée une pandémie par l'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé en date du 11 mars 2020. Pour les médecins et les professionnels de la santé alliés, cette période a été marquée par un flux d'information sans cesse croissante et rapidement évolutive provenant de la part des autorités de santé régionaux, nationaux et internationaux, des organismes régulateurs et des associations professionnelles. Bien que les plateformes des médias sociaux permettent un moyen de dissémination instantanée de l'information et que les professionnels médicaux y participent activement, les outils traditionnels, tel que le courriel, demeurent des moyens de communication importants. Cet article explore les opportunités offertes par les différents réseaux sociaux, tels que Facebook, Reddit et TikTok, pour disséminer l'information médicale auprès des médecins ainsi que comme moyen de communiquer de l'information essentielle auprès du public en général.
12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	Bats are the natural host reservoir for range of emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which cause significant morbidity and mortality in other mammals, yet appear to result in no clinical consequences for bats. The ability of bats to coexist with a variety of viruses presents an interesting immunological problem that has not been examined in any detail but which could provide significant insights into the evolution of antiviral mechanisms in mammals. Towards a better understanding of the bat immune system, we analysed the expressed heavy chain variable (VH) regions of antibodies from the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto. The germline repertoire of the closely related Pteropid bat, Pteropus vampyrus, whose genome has been sequenced was also examined for comparative purposes. Representative VH genes were found in all three mammalian VH clans (I, II and III) in both the expressed P. alecto VH repertoire and the germline P. vampyrus VH repertoire. Evidence for the use of multiple heavy chain diversity (DH) and joining (JH) segments for the generation of diverse VDJ rearrangements was also present in the expressed antibody repertoire of P. alecto. The long period of co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses may have resulted in a variety of highly specific VH segments being hardwired into the genomes of bats and may have implications for their ability to successfully cope with a diversity of viral antigens.
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	Background: Schools are socially dense environments, and school-based outbreaks often predate and fuel communitywide transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza. While preemptive school closures can effectively reduce influenza transmission, they are disruptive and currently recommended only for pandemics. We assessed the feasibility of implementing other social distancing practices in K-12 schools as a first step in seeking an alternative to preemptive school closures. Methods: We conducted 36 focus groups with education and public health officials across the United States. We identified and characterized themes and compared feasibility of practices by primary versus secondary school and region of the United States. Results: Participants discussed 29 school practices (25 within-school practices implemented as part of the school day and 4 reduced-schedule practices that impact school hours). Participants reported that elementary schools commonly implement several within-school practices as part of routine operations such as homeroom stay, restriction of hall movement, and staggering of recess times. Because of routine implementation and limited use of individualized schedules within elementary schools, within-school practices were generally felt to be more feasible for elementary schools than secondary schools. Of reduced-schedule practices, shortening the school week and the school day was considered the most feasible; however, reduced-schedule practices were generally perceived to be less feasible than within-school practices for all grade levels. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that schools have many options to increase social distance other than closing. Future research should evaluate which of these seemingly feasible practices are effective in reducing influenza transmission in schools and surrounding communities.
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	Background: The limitations of forecasting (real-time statistical) and predictive (dynamic epidemiological) models have become apparent as COVID-19 has progressed from a rapid exponential ascent to a slower decent, which is dependent on unknowable parameters such as extent of social distancing and easing. We present a means to optimize a forecasting model by functionalizing our previously reported Asymmetric Gaussian model with SEIR-like parameters. Conversely, SEIR models can be adapted to better incorporate real-time data. Methods: Our previously reported asymmetric Gaussian model was shown to greatly improve on forecasting accuracy relative to use of symmetric functions, such as Gaussian and error functions for death rates and cumulative deaths, respectively. However, the reported asymmetric Gaussian implementation, which fitted well to the ascent and much of the recovery side of the real death rate data, was not agile enough to respond to changing social behavior that is resulting in persistence of infections and deaths in the later stage of recovery. We have introduced a time-dependent σ(t) parameter to account for transmission rate variability due to the effects of behavioral changes such as social distancing and subsequent social easing. The σ(t) parameter is analogous to the basic reproduction number R0 (infection factor) that is evidently not a constant during the progression of COVID-19 for a particular population. The popularly used SEIR model and its many variants are also incorporating a time dependent R0(t) to better describe the effects of social distancing and social easing to improve predictive capability when extrapolating from real-time data. Results: Comparisons are given for the previously reported Asymmetric Gaussian model and to the revised, what we call, SEIR Gaussian model. We also have developed an analogous model based on R0(t) that we call SEIR Statistical model to show the correspondence that can be attained. It is shown that these two models can replicate each other and therefore provide similar forecasts based on fitting to the same real-time data. We show the results for reported U.S. death rates up to June 12, 2020 at which time the cumulative death count was 113,820. The forecasted cumulative deaths for these two models and compared to the University of Washington (UW) IHME model are 140,440, 139,272, and 149,690 (for 8/4/20) and 147,819, 148, 912, and 201,129 (for 10/1/20), respectively. We also show how the SEIR asymmetric Gaussian model can also account for various scenarios of social distancing, social easing, and even rebound outbreaks where the death and case rates begin climbing again. Conclusions: Forecasting models, based on real-time data, are essential for guiding policy and human behavior to minimize the deadly impact of COVID-19 while balancing the need to socialize and energize the economy. It is becoming clear that changing social behavior from isolation to easing requires models that can adapt to the changing transmission rate in order to more accurately forecast death and case rates. We believe our asymmetric Gaussian approach has advantages over modified SEIR models in offering simpler governing equations that are dependent on fewer variables.
5586a9e0d884dc39d90a1c4fd8f293459dd5f661	Background English springer spaniels (ESS) show an increased risk of chronic hepatitis (CH). In a previous study of 68 ESS with CH, in which only one dog received corticosteroids, a median survival time of 189 days was noted. Some ESS with CH appear to improve with prednisolone treatment; therefore, we aimed to investigate the response to prednisolone in this breed. Participants ESS with histologically confirmed idiopathic CH were treated with prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day. Nine female and three male ESS were enrolled (median age at diagnosis of five years). Patients were monitored clinically and had biochemistry samples taken to assess markers of hepatocellular damage and function. Results The mean starting dose of prednisolone was 1.1 mg/kg/day. All symptomatic patients showed an initial clinical improvement. Two cases were euthanased while receiving prednisolone. The median time since diagnosis is 1715 days (range: 672-2105 days) and the remaining patients are clinically well, with seven patients still receiving a mean dose of 0.4 mg/kg prednisolone every other day. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant (P<0.05) reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin following 2-4 weeks of prednisolone treatment. Conclusion This study demonstrates improved clinical and biochemical parameters when some ESS with CH are managed with prednisolone and standard supportive treatments.
f3096baa53811f05e1bb14c26e2c464c06b02bf7	The COVID-19 pandemic presents potential mental health challenges, and the American Orthodox Jewish population has been particularly affected by the virus. The current study assessed the impact of the pandemic and explored the relationships between exposure, religiosity, and distress in a sample of n = 419 American Orthodox Jews. Results indicated high levels of exposure, concern, and compliance with medical guidelines; however stress was generally low and we found evidence for positive impact. Direct exposure correlated with higher religiosity. Positive religious coping, intrinsic religiosity and trust in God strongly correlated with less stress and more positive impact, while negative religious coping and mistrust in God correlated with the inverse. While the study is limited by its design, findings highlight that for some, faith may promote resilience especially during crisis.

9ae96559416973a6d3bb6ddd5d446bfb4aaf40a0	is one of the most widely used MD vaccines in poultry industry. Vaccines can be adjuvanted with Tolllike receptor ligands (TLR-Ls) to enhance their efficacy. In this study, we examined whether combining TLR-Ls with HVT can boost host immunity against MD and improve its efficacy. Results demonstrated that HVT alone or HVT combined with encapsulated CpG-ODN partially protected chickens from tumor incidence and reduced virus replication compared to the control group. However, encapsulated CpG-ODN only moderately, but not significantly, improved HVT efficacy and reduced tumor incidence from 53% to 33%. Marek's disease (MD) in chickens is caused by an alpha herpesvirus, Marek's Disease Virus (MDV), which is currently controlled in chicken farms by vaccination, selection of genetic lines resistant to MD and biosecurity measures. Depending on the host and virus virulence, MDV can cause more than 90% morbidity and mortality in susceptible chickens 1 . Chickens become infected by MDV following inhalation of infected dust via the respiratory route. MDV primarily infects macrophages, B and T cells and it mainly transforms CD4+ T cells although other T cell subtypes are susceptible to transformation 2,3 . Generally, MDV life cycle can be divided into the cytolytic phase (2-7 days post-infection -dpi), latent phase (7-10 dpi), late cytolytic phase, and transformation phase 2 . Lysis of lymphocytes and activation of TGF-beta + regulatory T cells are a few mechanisms among others which induce immunosuppression during MDV infection 4 . Furthermore, transformed T cells proliferate form lymphoma which can lead to immunosuppression and clinical and pathological signs of disease. In the course of infection, MDV replicates in feather follicular epithelium and sheds into the environment throughout the lifespan of an infected chicken. Since MDV was first identified more than 50 years ago, several vaccines have been developed to control clinical signs of the disease, although none of them can fully prevent replication or transmission of MDV. Because of the inability of vaccines to control MDV transmission, it is believed that vaccines have prompted the emergence of virulent strains of MDV 5 . Herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) is one of the MD vaccines which is extensively used worldwide either alone or in combination with other MD vaccine 6 .

db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for the regulation of gene expression. Small exogenous noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as siRNA and shRNA are the active silencing agents, intended to target and cleave complementary mRNAs in a specifi c way. They are widely and successfully employed in functional studies, and several ongoing and already completed siRNA-based clinical trials suggest encouraging results in the regulation of overexpressed genes in disease. siRNAs share many aspects of their biogenesis and function with miRNAs, small ncRNA molecules transcribed from endogenous genes which are able to repress the expression of target mRNAs by either inhibiting their translation or promoting their degradation. Although siRNA and artifi cial miRNA molecules can signifi cantly reduce the expression of overexpressed target genes, cancer and other diseases can also be triggered or sustained by upregulated miRNAs. Thus, in the past recent years, molecular tools for miRNA silencing, such as antagomiRs and miRNA sponges, have been developed. These molecules have shown their effi cacy in the derepression of genes downregulated by overexpressed miRNAs. In particular, while a single antagomiR is able to inhibit a single complementary miRNA, an artifi cial sponge construct usually contains one or more binding sites for one or more miRNAs and functions by competing with the natural targets of these miRNAs. As a consequence, natural miRNA targets are reexpressed at their physiological level. In this chapter we review the most successful methods for the computational design of siRNAs, antagomiRs, and miRNA sponges and describe the most popular tools that implement them.
db59fbca0301f41d8427160ce935e98754b3cdfd	Objective To assess the frequency of B. pertussis infection among young infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis and to determine whether B. pertussis infection affects the clinical course of acute bronchiolitis. Methods A total of 172 infants <6 months of age hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis were tested for B. pertussis and respiratory viruses with real-time PCR. Cases were divided into 2 groups according to B. pertussis positive or negative. Clinical parameters, clinical severity scores and laboratory characteristics of the pertussis-positive and pertussis-negative cases were compared. Results Bordetella pertussis infection was detected in 44 (25.6%) of the 172 infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis, and as co-infection with respiratory viral agents in 27 (61.4%) infants. Of the 44 pertussis-positive infants, only 17 (38.6%) experienced a paroxysmal cough, 13 (29.5%) had whooping and 15 (34.1%) had post-tussive vomiting. There was no significant difference between pertussis-positive and pertussisnegative infants according to Wang clinical score at admission (4.9 ± 1.5 vs. 5.2 ± 2.5; p = 0.689). The overall disease severity score was also similar between the two groups (6.5 ± 1.4 vs. 6.9 ± 1.6; p = 0.095). Conclusions Bordetella pertussis infection is common in young infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis, mostly as co-infection with respiratory viruses. The clinical features of pertussis in the infants are not characteristic. Viral bronchiolitis and pertussis cases could not be differentiated by clinical findings. Co-infection with pertussis did not affect the clinical outcome in infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis.
7995e60fc463c15c65d6b2afeb65aa616d2188ec	Being madly in love with all the advances in minimally invasive medicine and technology I often tell my friends the stories of how interventional radiology (IR) changes lives. One of these unintended stories led to a much bigger audience of TED community and spread the word about IR far beyond the circle of my friends. As the TED slogan promised, participating in the event 1 made me realize that our ideas of better medicine are worth sharing. It also made me think that better communication with the public is possible, and it does not take genius. It takes a willingness to try. We know that IR with its broad procedural spectrum, safety of minimally invasive approach, lower requirement for anesthesia and hospitalization, and cost-effectiveness has a strong stand in the evolving universal healthcare practice model. But, as Goethe said, knowing is not enough; we must apply. 2 Then, how can we as medical community increase the exercise of IR procedures? The starting point is to accept that many people, including medical professionals, do not know what diseases we can treat and what diagnostic or therapeutic services we can provide. Either it is a palliative treatment of metastases, or elective embolization of uterine fibroids, or emergent lysis of pulmonary embolism-it is our responsibility to find the appropriate patients and let both patients and primary physicians know what options we have to offer.
03d40dcd5d29728439528bd955afcba42bc0c2b9	The continued spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus underscores the importance of effective antiviral approaches. AVFluIgG01 is a potent and broad-reactive H5N1-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb) showing great potential for use either for therapeutic purposes or as a basis of vaccine development, but its antigenic epitope and neutralization mechanism have not been finely characterized. In this study, we first demonstrated that AVFluIgG01 targets a novel conformation-dependent epitope in the globular head region of H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA). By selecting mimotopes from a random peptide library in combination with computational algorithms and site-directed mutagenesis, the epitope was mapped to three conserved discontinuous sites (I-III) that are located closely at the threedimensional structure of HA. Further, we found that this HA1-specific human mAb can efficiently block both virus-receptor binding and post-attachment steps, while its Fab fragment exerts the post-attachment inhibition only. Consistently, AVFluIgG01 could inhibit HA-mediated cell-cell membrane fusion at a dose-dependent manner and block the acquisition of pH-induced protease sensitivity. These results suggest a neutralization mechanism of AVFluIgG01 by simultaneously blocking viral attachment to the receptors on host cells and interfering with HA conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. The presented data provide critical information for developing novel antiviral therapeutics and vaccines against HPAI H5N1 virus.
20af160641510a4c79b9a23b06ea83d27ebba059	In the investigation of the role of GLTSCR2 that played in the cellular innate immune response to viral infection, we found GLTSCR2 supported viral replication of rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, and coronavirus in cells. Viral infection induced translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm that enabled GLTSCR2 to attenuate type I interferon IFN-β and support viral replication. Cytoplasmic GLTSCR2 was able to interact with retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15), and the triple interaction induced USP15 activity to remove K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, leading to attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-β. Blocking cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2, by deletion of its nuclear export sequence (NES), abrogated its ability to attenuate IFN-β and support viral replication. GLTSCR2-mediated attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-β led to alleviation of host cell innate immune response to viral infection. Our findings suggested that GLTSCR2 contributed to efficient viral replication, and GLTSCR2 should be considered as a potential target for therapeutic control of viral infection. Innate immunity is critical for defending the host from pathogens, and type I interferon (IFN) is the core of cellular antiviral response 1-5 . Upon viral infection, host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), are able to detect viral nucleic acids and initiate a series of cell signals, leading to induction of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines 2-5 . RIG-I, a family member of RLRs, interacts with viral RNA and recruits mitochondrial-associated virus stimulator (MAVS, also known as IPS-1, Cardif, and VISA) 6,7 . MAVS recruits tumor necrosis receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) that results in TRAF3 lysine 63 (K63)-linked auto-ubiquitination to provide docking sites for TANK binding kinase 1/I kappa-B kinase epsilon (TBK1/IKKε ) complex 8-10 . This complex undergoes auto-phosphorylation-mediated activation, resulting in phosphorylating and activating the type I IFN regulatory factor IRF3 or/and IRF7 to form homodimers or heterodimers that translocate into the nucleus for induction of type I IFN 10,11 . The complex also activates canonical IKK for NF-κ B activation to induce proinflammatory cytokines 12 . Studies also showed that dephosphorylation (Thr170) of RIG-I by the phosphatase PP1 α /γ 13 and K63-linked ubiquitination (Lys172) of RIG-I by the ubiquitin E3 ligase tripartite motif proteins TRIM25 14 and TRIM4 15 lead to RIG-I activation and type I IFN production. Studies have shown that viral infection, including rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, coronavirus, and herpesvirus, may counteract RIG-I-dependent IFN antiviral response 16 . Rabies virus is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, and Rabies virus (Ni strain)-expressed N protein has a function to evade the activation of RIG-I and RIG-I-mediated innate immunity 17 . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, and RSV-expressed nonstructural NS2 protein inhibits IFN transcription induced by binding RIG-I and inhibiting its interaction with the downstream component MAVS 18 . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family, and PEDV-expressed papain-like protease 2 (PLP2), which has deubiqutinase (DUB) activity, reduces both K48-linked and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains and inhibits RIG-I-activated IFN expression 19 . Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-expressed US11 protein antagonizes IFN-β production by binding RIG-I 20 . Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-expressed ORF64, which is a tegument protein with DUB activity, suppresses type I IFN signaling by blocking the ubiquitination of RIG-I 21 . Cellular ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), a subfamily of DUB 22 , regulate ubiquitination of RIG-I 23 . USP21 and USP15 remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I and block the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-β 24,25 . USP15
52e3038903ef839e0bf0638bce3f40459aaf1aba	The recent spread of COVID-19 across the U.S. led to concerted efforts by states to "flatten the curve" through the adoption of stay-at-home mandates that encourage individuals to reduce travel and maintain social distance and indeed using data on travel activity we find that residents start reducing mobility early in most states. Combining data on changes in travel activity with COVID-19 health outcomes and variation in state policy adoption, we characterize the direct impact of stay-at-home mandates on mobility and social distancing and link these behavioral changes to health benefits. We find evidence of dramatic declines in mobility nationwide prior to the adoption of statewide mandates. Despite these early reductions, we find that statewide stay-at-home policies induced "mandate effects" of between 4.1 and 5.9 percentage point declines relative to pre-COVID-19 levels for the first four states to introduce such policies. These effects persist when considering all states' mandates and alternate estimation strategies that account for states' differences in travel behavior prior to policy adoption. Using previous changes in mobility, we find significant effects on current mortality, with 1% reductions in visits to non-essential businesses weeks prior being associated with 9.2 fewer deaths per 100 million per day, corresponding with over 74,000 lives saved nationwide and resulting economic benefits between $249-$745 billion for .

54621417dcb47ddb375f6c07fecf959194c49ade	The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health problem unprecedented in the recent history of humanity. Different in-house real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the appearance of genomes with mutations in primer regions have been reported. Hence, whole-genome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global variability and the development and fine tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main in-house methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers/probes sequences from 13 target regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3' end of each primer, the open reading frame inspection was identified for each gene/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country. Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and N genes were observed. The 3' end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position. Genetic variability was detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR diagnostic tests available at WHO COVID-19 technical guidelines; its impact on the performance and rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated. The genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the early identification of mutations in critical regions and to issue recommendations on specific diagnostic tests to ensure the coverage of locally-circulating genetic variants. Genetic diversity SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a positive polarity single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 30 kb.

6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	Mathematical models are often regarded as recent innovations in the description and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, but simple mathematical expressions have been in use for projection of epidemic trajectories for more than a century. We recently introduced a single equation model (the incidence decay with exponential adjustment, or IDEA model) that can be used for short-term epidemiological forecasting. In the mid-19th century, Dr. William Farr made the observation that epidemic events rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern that can be approximated by a bell-shaped curve. He noticed that this time-evolution behavior could be captured by a single mathematical formula ("Farr's law") that could be used for epidemic forecasting. We show here that the IDEA model follows Farr's law, and show that for intuitive assumptions, Farr's Law can be derived from the IDEA model. Moreover, we show that both mathematical approaches, Farr's Law and the IDEA model, resemble solutions of a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental differential-equation model in an asymptotic limit, where the changes of disease transmission respond to control measures, and not only to the depletion of susceptible individuals. This suggests that the concept of the reproduction number ðR 0 Þ was implicitly captured in Farr's (pre-microbial era) work, and also suggests that control of epidemics, whether via behavior change or intervention, is as integral to the natural history of epidemics as is the dynamics of disease transmission.
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	A strategy for preventing further spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic is to detect infections and isolate infected individuals without the need of extensive biospecimen testing. Objectives: Here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases. Design: Community survey. including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative. In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10 -59 . We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77].
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs, and the N-terminal domain of TGEV spike protein is generally recognized as both the virulence determinant and enteric tropism determinant. Here, we assembled a full-length infectious cDNA clone of TGEV in a bacterial artificial chromosome. Using a novel approach, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) systems efficiently and rapidly rescued another recombinant virus with a 224-amino-acid deletion in the N-terminal domain of the TGEV Spike gene (S_NTD224), which is analogous to the N-terminal domain of porcine respiratory coronavirus. S_NTD224 notably affected the TGEV growth kinetics in PK-15 cells but was not essential for recombinant virus survival. In animal experiments with 13 two-day-old piglets, the TGEV recombinant viruses with/without S_NTD224 deletion induced obvious clinical signs and mortality. Together, our results directly demonstrated that S_NTD224 of TGEV mildly influenced TGEV virulence but was not the enteric tropism determinant and provide new insights for the development of a new attenuated vaccine against TGEV. Importantly, the optimized reverse genetics platform used in this study will simplify the construction of mutant infectious clones and help accelerate progress in coronavirus research. (ORFs), which encode polyprotein 1a (pp1a), polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab), spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleoprotein (N) [10, 11] . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), one of the representative CoVs of the Alphacoronavirus genus, is the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in pigs [12] . TGEV is widespread in the pork industry, causes high mortality in neonatal pigs, and is generally thought to share a common ancestor with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) [13] . Both TGEV and PRCV have a common cell receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN), but a coreceptor (Neu5Gc) of TGEV is recognized to confer enteric tropism to TGEV [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, TGEV always causes severe diarrhea, whereas PRCV usually causes mild or no clinical signs [18] . Compared with TGEV Spike gene, large deletions (200-230 aa) were found in the N-terminal domain of PRCV Spike gene [19] . The N-terminal domain of the S-glycoprotein is considered to be responsible for the different clinical signs of TGEV and PRCV and is generally recognized as not only the virulence determinant but also an enteric tropism determinant [13, 20] . Previous research has shown that PRCVs are likely derived from an N-terminal amino-acid deletion of the TGEV Spike protein [15, 21] , but direct evidence obtained from reverse genetics is still needed to confirm this hypothesis. Since the first successful construction of TGEV infectious clones, the various reverse genetic systems that have been developed have made a considerable contribution to CoV research, particularly research in MERS, SARS, TGEV, and PEDV [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Among the various reverse genetics methods for CoVs, transfection of the full-length infectious cDNA clone and cotransfection of the full-length RNA and N gene transcripts are the most commonly adopted methods for the rescue of recombinant viruses [25, 26, [28] [29] [30] . However, these methods usually require the manipulation of several cDNA fragments or plasmids for the construction of a new mutant CoV [31] . Although targeted RNA recombination or the Red-mediated recombination strategy might partly accelerate or simplify the process of constructing an infectious recombinant virus, the selection of the correct positive clone is also a time-consuming process [32] [33] [34] [35] . In fact, the limitations of the various currently available traditional reverse genetics methods for CoV genome manipulation, such as ligation with several cDNA fragments in vitro, targeted RNA recombination, division of toxic gene sequence propagation in bacteria, or recombinant vaccinia virus vectors, have severely hampered the speed and efficiency of developing CoV reverse genetics techniques [23, [36] [37] [38] . CRISPR/Cas systems, which constitute a recent new gene editing technology developed from the RNA-mediated adaptive defense systems evolved by bacteria and archaea, have been applied to a wide variety of organisms for the in vivo editing of large genomes [39] [40] [41] . Furthermore, some studies have investigated the in vitro editing of DNA fragments or plasmids [42] [43] [44] . In general, the CRISPR/Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes, namely, the SpyCas9 protein with a mature single-guide RNA (sgRNA), is used for in vitro DNA cleavage [42] . However, the in vitro editing of RNA virus genomes, particularly viruses with large RNA genomes, such as CoVs, using this method has not been reported. In this study, we successfully constructed a TGEV infectious clone and utilized the molecular scissors of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to rescue another TGEV mutant with S_NTD224 deletion [45] . Through animal experiments involving challenge with two types of rescued recombinant TGEV viruses, we elucidated that TGEV S_NTD224 was not the determinant in viral enteric tropism and pathogenesis.

Few data are available that quantify feed and water consumption, as well as growth, in healthy versus non-healthy calves-the objective of this study. A database of Holstein calves (<1 wk of age; n = 313) was developed to compare calves that developed diarrhea in the first 21 d after arrival from commercial farms to the research facility versus calves that remained healthy. Individual calf data from 4 experiments included daily intake of milk replacer, free water, electrolyte solution, and starter grain, as well as weekly body weight (BW) and frame measures for 21 d after arrival. Calves with a fecal score of >2 for ≥3 consecutive days over the first 21 d of each experiment were retrospectively classified as diarrheic (DIA; n = 96); the remainder were classified as healthy (HEA; n = 217). Other health issues were minimal. The likelihood of elevated fecal score occurrence and the cumulative number of days with an elevated score were greater for DIA calves than for HEA calves. The initial total protein concentration in blood did not differ between classifications. Cumulative milk replacer dry matter intake (DMI) and water consumed from milk replacer were significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves, because DIA calves were more likely to refuse milk replacer. Cumulative starter DMI was decreased for DIA versus HEA calves. As a result, cumulative total DMI was significantly less for DIA calves than for HEA calves. Cumulative free water intake did not differ between classifications. The DIA calves were more likely to receive electrolyte solution and have more days given electrolyte solution than HEA calves. As a result, total cumulative intake of electrolyte solution was greater in DIA calves than in HEA calves. Cumulative total water intake did not differ between classifications. Initial BW did not differ between classifications; however, a classification × time interaction for BW indicated that HEA calves were heavier than DIA calves and had greater ADG. Significant classification × time interactions for hip height and heart girth revealed that HEA calves had a larger frame size. Gain-feed ratios for both milk replacer intake and total DMI differed between classifications: DIA calves were less feed-efficient than HEA calves. In conclusion, diarrhea in young calves decreases DMI, BW gain, and feed efficiency relative to HEA calves within 21 d of arrival.

b5029e860ef1981b225cbfa5b4b94ba57775e19f	STMC is a statistical model checker that uses antithetic and stratified sampling techniques to reduce the number of samples and, hence, the amount of time required before making a decision. The tool is capable of statistically verifying any black-box probabilistic system that PRISM can simulate, against probabilistic bounds on any property that PRISM can evaluate over individual executions of the system. We have evaluated our tool on many examples and compared it with both symbolic and statistical algorithms. When the number of strata is large, our algorithms reduced the number of samples more than 3 times on average. Furthermore, being a statistical model checker makes STMC able to verify models that are well beyond the reach of current symbolic model checkers. On large systems (up to 10 14 states) STMC was able to check 100% of benchmark systems, compared to existing symbolic methods in PRISM, which only succeeded on 13% of systems. The tool, installation instructions, benchmarks, and scripts for running the benchmarks are all available online as open source.

Two-year mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been estimated using a pre-transplantation assessment of mortality (PAM) score which incorporates spirometry and diffusing capacity variables in combination with the presence of renal and hepatic dysfunction, conditioning regimen, and disease risk. a. Obstructive lung disease is diagnosed with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 70 % and FEV1 < 80 %. If plethysmography (measurement of changes in lung volumes) is performed, increased residual volume (RV) indicates air trapping as seen in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). b. Low FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio indicates restriction. Lung volumes will help confirm restriction as seen in idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) or usual interstitial pneumonia. All lung volumes, including RV, will be reduced with restriction. a. Diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) corrected for hemoglobin should be used (DLCOadj) b. > 80 % normal, 60-80 % mild, 40-60 % moderate, < 40 % severe impairment
7d262832606b297d4d1cd2af7a45578d10823418	The 2014-15 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for large disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable focus on preparedness for future epidemics. Here we discuss drivers, strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens. Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer. ChAd vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad vectors. For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here, particularly for Lassa fever, Nipah and MERS.

98ffae8d82c7e534fd8573095f711445b292c113	Immune responses to protein and peptide drugs can alter or reduce their efficacy and may be associated with adverse effects. While anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are a standard clinical measure of protein therapeutic immunogenicity, T cell epitopes in the primary sequences of these drugs are the key drivers or modulators of ADA response, depending on the type of T cell response that is stimulated (e.g., T helper or Regulatory T cells, respectively). In a previous publication on T cell-dependent immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, we addressed mitigation efforts such as identifying and reducing the presence of T cell epitopes or T cell response to protein therapeutics prior to further development of the protein therapeutic for clinical use. Over the past 5 years, greater insight into the role of regulatory T cell epitopes and the conservation of T cell epitopes with self (beyond germline) has improved the preclinical assessment of immunogenic potential. In addition, impurities contained in therapeutic drug formulations such as host cell proteins have also attracted attention and become the focus of novel risk assessment methods. Target effects have come into focus, given the emergence of protein and peptide drugs that target immune receptors in immuno-oncology applications. Lastly, new modalities are entering the clinic, leading to the need to revise certain aspects of the preclinical immunogenicity assessment pathway. In addition to drugs that have multiple antibody-derived domains or non-antibody scaffolds, therapeutic drugs may now be introduced via viral vectors, cell-based constructs, or nucleic acid based therapeutics that may, in addition to delivering drug, also prime the immune system, driving immune response to the delivery vehicle as well as the encoded therapeutic, adding to the complexity of assessing immunogenicity risk. While it is challenging to keep pace with emerging methods for the preclinical assessment of protein therapeutics and new biologic therapeutic modalities, this collective compendium provides a guide to current best practices and new concepts in the field.
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	The rate of change in selective pressures is one of the main factors that determines the likelihood that populations can adapt to stress conditions. Generally, the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations. However, in systems with high genetic diversity, as happens in RNA viruses, mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population, facilitating adaptation. In this work, we have propagated an RNA bacteriophage (Qβ) at temperatures higher than the optimum, following different patterns of change. We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways. Our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes, differing also in the particular selected mutations. The life-history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation. The conclusion is that in the bacteriophage Qβ, the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways. Evolution in gradually changing environments has been modeled as a process of adaptation to a moving optimum [17] [18] [19] [20] . The lower the rate of change, the smaller the drop in fitness the population experiences in each of the environments to which it is exposed. This means that the selective pressure under change has a low intensity at any point of the process and adaptation will occur through the selection of beneficial mutations that provide small effects on fitness [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since these mutations are relatively abundant [21] [22] [23] , there could be a diversity of accessible pathways for adaptation to gradual changes. In contrast to this, rapid environmental changes usually produce strong fitness drops that severely decrease the population size and, thus, the associated genetic diversity [24] [25] [26] [27] , making it difficult to find the scarce, large effect mutations that would make adaptation possible, unless those mutants already exist in the population, in which case the population bottleneck might help them to fix. The situation is even harsher when a particular combination of mutations is required for optimal adaptation. Due to the generally lower number of adaptive solutions to rapid changes, evolution would be more constrained under this condition than when changes take place at a slower rate [28] . Additionally, because epistatic interactions among mutations of small effect are weaker [29, 30] , it has also been suggested that gradual regimes would allow for populations to reach higher fitness values. There are many experimental studies using a variety of biological systems, such as bacteria [12, 31] , unicellular algae [9], yeasts [14,16,32], or viruses [13,15,33], and selective pressures, such as antibiotics [12,31], heavy metals [14,16], new hosts [13,15], salt stress [32], or changes in temperature [33], that have explored the influence of the rate of environmental change on adaptation. In good agreement with the predictions of the models, in some studies the rate of population extinction was higher under more rapid environmental changes [12,31-33] due to the strong decline in population sizes and also, in some cases, because the adapted genotypes were only accessible upon a previous sequence of environments. This kind of historical contingency can occur when certain mutations that permit survival at high intensity of the selective pressure are deleterious in the absence of other mutations that can only be selected at a lower intensity of the selective pressure [12, 34] . There are also examples showing that populations evolving under gradual changes reached higher fitness values [9, 13, 25] and/or displayed more genetic diversity among replicate lineages than those evolving under more abrupt changes [9, 12] . In contrast to this, the results obtained in other studies manifested some discrepancy with the prediction of the models, showing that phenotypes obtained under rapid environmental change were fitter [31, 32, 35] or contained a greater diversity of mutations than those evolving at a slower pace [13] . Finally, other studies did not find differences either in the fitness or in the genetic diversity contained in populations that could be attributed to the rate of environmental change [14, 16, 36] . Altogether, those results suggest that the differences in evolutionary outcomes due to the rate of change in the selective pressures depend on both the biological system-with its particular mutation and replication rates, relevance of epistatic interactions, and underlying distribution of mutational effects-and on the assayed environmental condition. In this work, we studied how a temperature increase of fixed magnitude but variable rate influenced evolutionary outcomes in an RNA bacteriophage. Specifically, we used as a model the bacteriophage Qβ, of the family Leviviridae, which infects Escherichia coli strains expressing the F pilus that acts as the virus receptor [37] . Bacteriophage Qβ has an RNA genome of positive polarity (such as poliovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, or the coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome) of 4217 nucleotides that encodes four proteins: the A2 protein for bacterial lysis and entry, the coat protein, the A1 protein, which is present in low amounts in the capsid and expressed through incorrect reading of the stop codon of the coat protein, and the replicase that copies the RNA genome [37] . As in other RNA viruses, replication in Qβ proceeds at a high error rate [38] , giving rise to highly heterogeneous populations that adapt fast. The optimal temperature for replication of this virus is 37 • C (the host temperature). Much of the difficulty in treating diseases caused by viruses, especially RNA viruses, stems from their high evolutionary potential [39] [40] [41] . Infection of new hosts, adaptation to antivirals, or the emergence of variants that cannot be neutralized by antibodies are only a few examples of the great Pathogens 2019, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 18

c28c862de858b4bb0a7da04646a1315574f760db	Atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD) is a chronic process, with a progressive course over many years, but it can cause acute clinical events, including acute coronary syndromes (ACS), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. In addition to a series of typical risk factors for atherosclerosis, like hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and obesity, emerging evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, suggesting that chronic infection plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most characteristic members of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which play an important role in innate immune mechanism. TLRs play different roles in different stages of infection of atherosclerosis-related pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae), periodontal pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, activation of TLR2 and 4 seems to have a profound impact on infection-related atherosclerosis. This article reviews the role of TLRs in the process of atherosclerosis after C. pneumoniae and other infections and the current status of treatment, with a view to providing a new direction and potential therapeutic targets for the study of ASVD.
c7cea71441bd253d097fa43e2a8aeb3797805231	Systemic administration of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) reportedly attenuates acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration and phorbol myristate acetate. However, the effects of PFCs on ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced lung injury have not been investigated. Typical acute lung injury was induced in rats by 60 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion in isolated and perfused rat lung model. Rat lungs were randomly assigned to receive PBS (control), 1 % FC-77, IR only, or IR with different doses of FC-77 (0.1 %, 0.5 %, or 1 %). Subsequently, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), perfusate, and lung tissues were collected to evaluate the degree of lung injury. IR caused a significant increase in the following parameters: pulmonary arterial pressure, capillary filtration coefficient, lung weight gain, lung weight/body weight ratio, wet/dry lung weight ratio, and protein concentration in BALF. TNF-α and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 concentrations in perfusate samples and MDA concentration and MPO activities in lung tissues were also significantly increased. Histopathology showed increased septal thickness and neutrophil infiltration in the lung tissues. Furthermore, NF-κB activity was significantly increased in the lungs. However, pretreatment with 1 % FC-77 prior to IR significantly attenuated the increases in these parameters. In conclusion, our results suggest that systemic FC-77 administration had a protective effect on IRinduced acute lung injury. These protective mechanisms may have been mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB activation and attenuation of subsequent inflammatory response.
eff2ec1a5c956be225d9058f9aece5fa59bc7abc	Parents of children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities in the UK (n = 241) were asked to describe the impact of COVID-19 on their own mental health and that of their child. An inductive content analysis of the data was undertaken. Both parents and children appear to be experiencing loss, worry and changes in mood and behaviour as a result of the rapid social changes that have occurred. Some parents reported feeling overwhelmed and described the impact of child understanding and awareness. Finally, a minority of parents reported that COVID-19 has had little impact on mental health in their family, or has even led to improvements. Implications for how to support these families in the immediate future are discussed.
ff6e7c70571d00234a94ebb6964d5bff82b053e4	Synopsis Billions of animals migrate each year. To successfully reach their destination, migrants must have evolved an appropriate genetic program and suitable developmental, morphological, physiological, biomechanical, behavioral, and life-history traits. Moreover, they must interact successfully with biotic and abiotic factors in their environment. Migration therefore provides an excellent model system in which to address several of the ''grand challenges'' in organismal biology. Previous research on migration, however, has often focused on a single aspect of the phenomenon, largely due to methodological, geographical, or financial constraints. Integrative migration biology asks 'big questions' such as how, when, where, and why animals migrate, which can be answered by examining the process from multiple ecological and evolutionary perspectives, incorporating multifaceted knowledge from various other scientific disciplines, and using new technologies and modeling approaches, all within the context of an annual cycle. Adopting an integrative research strategy will provide a better understanding of the interactions between biological levels of organization, of what role migrants play in disease transmission, and of how to conserve migrants and the habitats upon which they depend. evolve quite rapidly (Able and Belthoff 1998; Alerstam et al. 2003; Bisson et al. 2009a) . For these and many other reasons, we can use the phenomenon of migration to meet the five grand challenges in organismal biology identified by Schwenk et al. (2009): (1) understanding organismal responses to the environment, (2) using the functional diversity of organisms, (3) integrating living and physical systems, (4) understanding how genomes produce phenotypes, and (5) understanding how organisms trade-off stability and change.
eb03629185583e8b0a8022835e3849e05d9ed11c	Background: Cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed types of surgery. Most patients suffer from bilateral cataract and while cataract surgery of only one eye is effective in restoring functional vision, second-eye surgery leads to further improvements in health-related quality of life, and is cost-effective. At present, most patients undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days as recommended in national guidelines, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating both eyes on the same day, but as separate procedures, known as immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, in order to test the hypothesis that ISBCS is non-inferior to DSBCS in terms of effectiveness and superior to ISBCS in terms of costeffectiveness. Methods/design: Multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled clinical trial. Patients (18 years or older) with bilateral cataract and an indication for bilateral cataract surgery with an expected uncomplicated intraoperative and postoperative course are included in the study. Patients are randomly assigned to either ISBCS or DSBCS. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a refractive outcome in the second eye within 1.0 dioptre from the target refraction, at 4 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes include corrected and uncorrected distance visual acuity, complications, patient reported outcomes (PROMs), cost-effectiveness, and budget impact. Follow-up visits are planned at 1 week after first-eye surgery and 4 weeks after second-eye surgery. At 3 months after first-eye surgery, the occurrence of complications is checked and patients fill in a final questionnaire.

Although the importance of IFNs in the antiviral response has long been appreciated, their role in bacterial infections is more complex and is currently a major focus of investigation. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the role of these cytokines in host defense against the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and highlights recent discoveries on the molecular mechanisms evolved by this intracellular bacterium to subvert IFN responses.

Crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase in complex with a non-carbohydrate-based inhibitor, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid a b s t r a c t Anti-bacterial and anti-viral neuraminidase agents inhibit neuraminidase activity catalyzing the hydrolysis of terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) from glycoconjugates and help to prevent the host pathogenesis that lead to fatal infectious diseases including influenza, bacteremia, sepsis, and cholera. Emerging antibiotic and drug resistances to commonly used anti-neuraminidase agents such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) have highlighted the need to develop new anti-neuraminidase drugs. We obtained a serendipitous complex crystal of the catalytic domain of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (CpNanI CD ) with 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid (CHES) as a buffer. Here, we report the crystal structure of CpNanI CD in complex with CHES at 1.24 Å resolution. Amphipathic CHES binds to the catalytic site of CpNanI CD similar to the substrate (Neu5Ac) binding site. The 2aminoethanesulfonic acid moiety and cyclohexyl groups of CHES interact with the cluster of three arginine residues and with the hydrophobic pocket of the CpNanI CD catalytic site. In addition, a structural comparison with other bacterial and human neuraminidases suggests that CHES could serve as a scaffold for the development of new anti-neuraminidase agents targeting CpNanI.
1eb44665543150a4a6b5f2ae166823a07ff52d29	We create an agent based network model that simulates an epidemic. We combine population decisions for vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Vaccination mitigates epidemic final size effectively for high transmission rates. Non-pharmaceutical interventions compensate for delays in vaccine availability. Non-pharmaceutical interventions can lower vaccine uptake and reduce epidemic size.
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	The COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic with community circulation in many countries, including the United States, with confirmed cases in all states. The course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information. Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. Using an event study framework for all US states, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away. However, the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements are followed by increasingly strong policy measures. Specifically, searches for "coronavirus" increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis should track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information. COVID-19 | Google Trends | information T he first confirmed case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States occurred in Washington State on January 21, 2020. Since then, the virus has spread across the country (1, 2). There are confirmed cases in every state, and the vast majority are not connected to international travel (3), indicating that the virus had been circulating for several weeks before the first positive test (4, 5). Slowing the transmission of the virus will help reduce the burden of the disease, save lives, and reduce strain on the health care system (4, 6). In the absence of a vaccine, the main strategies for reducing transmission involve sanitation and handwashing, disciplined social distancing, quarantines, and school and workplace closures (6). These nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective and powerful ways to control transmission (7), as shown by earlier epidemics (8) and the steady decline of COVID-19 cases in China (2). To be successful, NPIs require people to undertake behavioral changes that may be personally costly. This is particularly true in countries with deeply rooted norms about personal freedom and reluctance to impose mandatory policies. In settings where restrictions on the free movement of residents are less strictly enforced, it is especially critical for public officials to know whether and for how long statements from leaders motivate individuals to efficiently seek and absorb information, as officials put their communication strategies in place. Such coordinated actions are needed at the first signs of community spreading and cannot be guided through traditional polling methods, which take too long. Because the extent of the epidemic is likely to be underestimated at this stage, it is crucial to know how much the early case announcements induce heightened collective attention and information-seeking behavior. To provide rapid evidence to inform policy making, we use internet search data in an event study design to examine how collective attention and information-seeking behaviors respond to state government announcements of first COVID-19 cases. We highlight changes in search patterns occurring in the days leading up to and following first case announcements in a state (1, 2). Fig. 1 depicts the event study estimates of the effects of initial announcements on overall coronavirus search. Searches for "coronavirus" increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the announcement but quickly decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two (Fig. 1) . There was no observable trend in the search behavior in the days leading up to the announcements, suggesting the first "local" case indeed heightened the collective attention to the pandemic. However, the increased level of information seeking faded within 2 wk, even though many announcements of school closures or other mitigation strategies followed, suggesting that increased attention is only short-lived. This is consistent with no observable trend in the sense of urgency prior to the local announcement. Fig. 2 shows the event studies of internet search for 1) symptoms and treatments, 2) hand sanitizer and diagnostic tests, 3) coordinated responses, and 4) narratives that undermine public responses. News of the first COVID-19 case in a state leads to a 52% increase in searches for "coronavirus symptoms" but does not increase searches for coronavirus treatment options. The second row shows searches for "hand sanitizer" increasing 35% immediately after first case announcements, and, unlike in the previous two cases, the search activity remains high for the remainder of the observable period. However, the announcements do not induce searches for nearby coronavirus testing opportunities, at least in the period under study. The third row suggests that first case announcements do not induce search for community-level policies Results
20397f777711bd0749f90d527a2bbe97869e05ee	Background. The possible role of human coronavirus (HCoV) in lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) has not been well studied. Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of HCT/HM patients with HCoV detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples using strain-specific polymerase chain reaction. Mortality rates were compared among HCT recipients with LRTD caused by HCoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus (PIV) by multivariable Cox regression analysis. Results. We identified 35 patients (37 episodes) with HCoV LRTD. Among 23 available BAL samples, 48% were strain OC43, 22% were NL63, 17% were 229E, and 13% were HKU1. Overall, 21 patients (60%) required oxygen therapy at diagnosis and 19 (54%) died within 90 days of diagnosis. Respiratory copathogens were detected in 21 episodes (57%), including viruses (n = 12), fungi (n = 10), and bacteria (n = 8). Mortality rates were not different between patients with and without copathogens (P = .65). In multivariable models, mortality associated with HCoV LRTD was similar to that seen with RSV, influenza, and PIV LRTD in HCT recipients (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34 [95% confidence interval, .66-2.71], P = .41 vs RSV, adjusted for cell source, cytopenia, copathogens, oxygen use, and steroid use). Conclusions. HCoV LRTD in patients with HCT or HM is associated with high rates of oxygen use and mortality. Mortality associated with HCoV LRTD in HCT recipients appears to be similar to that seen with RSV, influenza virus, and PIV.
8a98cb8d707c25c75ab93abc33960cf417f03281	Background: Febrile travelers may pose a diagnostic challenge for Western physicians who are frequently involved in the assessment of these patients but unfamiliar with tropical diseases. Evaluation of this situation requires an understanding of the common etiologies, which are associated with the demographics of travelers and the destinations. Methods: We conducted a 5-year prospective observational study on the etiologies of fever in travelers returning from the tropics admitted to the infectious and tropical diseases unit of a university teaching hospital in Marseilles, France. Results: A total of 613 patients were enrolled, including 364 migrants (59.4%), 126 travelers (20.6%), 37 visitors (6%), 24 expatriates (3.9%), and 62 patients (10.1%) who could not be classified. Malaria was the most common diagnosis (75.2%), with most cases (62%) acquired by migrants from the Comoros archipelago and who had traveled to these islands to visit friends and relatives. Agents of food-borne and water-borne infections (3.9%) and respiratory tract infections (3.4%) were also frequently identified as the cause of fever. Other infections included emerging diseases such as gnathostomiasis, hepatitis E infection and rickettsial diseases, as well as common infections or exotic diseases. Conclusions: Although we have identified here various causes of imported fever, 8.2% of the fevers remained unexplained. An improved approach to diagnosis may allow for the discovery of new diseases in travelers in the future. Q (P.

ac0ed4e3ae92a0e194ea6808c289a0b6224ea054	Control strategies enforced by health agencies are a major type of practice to contain influenza outbreaks. Another type of practice is the voluntary preventive behavior of individuals, such as receiving vaccination, taking antiviral drugs, and wearing face masks. These two types of practices take effects concurrently in influenza containment, but little attention has been paid to their combined effectiveness. This article estimates this combined effectiveness using established simulation models in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, USA. Three control strategies are investigated, including: Targeted Antiviral Prophylaxis (TAP), workplace/school closure, community travel restriction, as well as the combination of the three. All control strategies are simulated with and without regard to individual preventive behavior, and the resulting effectiveness are compared. The simulation outcomes suggest that weaker control strategies could suffice to contain influenza epidemics, because individuals voluntarily adopt preventive behavior, rendering these weaker strategies more effective than would otherwise have been expected. The preventive behavior of individuals could save medical resources for control strategies and avoid unnecessary socio-economic interruptions. This research adds a human behavioral dimension into the simulation of control strategies and offers new insights into disease containment. Health policy makers are recommended to review current control strategies and comprehend preventive behavior patterns of local populations before making decisions on influenza containment.
298b1fb8728be8cf99f6397b2bc4a472bb69915c	Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes a non-contagious, arthropod-transmitted disease in wild and domestic ruminants, such as sheep. In this study, we used iTRAQ labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS for quantitative identification of differentially expressed proteins in BTV-infected sheep testicular (ST) cells. Relative quantitative data were obtained for 4455 proteins in BTVand mock-infected ST cells, among which 101 and 479 proteins were differentially expressed at 24 and 48 h post-infection, respectively, indicating further proteomic changes during the later stages of infection. Ten corresponding genes of differentially expressed proteins were validated via real-time RT-PCR. Expression levels of three representative proteins, eIF4a1, STAT1 and HSP27, were further confirmed via western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis disclosed that the differentially expressed proteins are primarily involved in biological processes related to innate immune response, signal transduction, nucleocytoplasmic transport, transcription and apoptosis. Several upregulated proteins were associated with the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and endocytosis. To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to investigate proteome-wide dysregulation in BTV-infected cells with the aid of quantitative proteomics. Our collective results not only enhance understanding of the host response to BTV infection but also highlight multiple potential targets for the development of antiviral agents.
1ebffeea6302e1f1733c9fc4e6659c26a97e6f94	Objective To fabricate an active and stable enzyme through covalent immobilization, a Ubl-specific protease (Ulp1) was used to cleave small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) fusion proteins. Results We immobilized Ulp1 on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated Sepharose with a coupling efficiency of 1.7 mg/ml. The immobilized Ulp1 maintains 95% substrate-cleavage ability and significantly enhances pH and thermal stability, especially can withstand pH of 10.5. Besides resistance against some small molecules, the immobilized Ulp1 can tolerate 15% (v/v) DMSO and 20% (v/v) ethanol. It can be reused for more than 15 batch reactions with 90% activity retention. This provides a fast purification system to quickly obtain cleaved recombinant proteins with 95% purity from cell lysates with the application of immobilized Ulp1. Conclusions Ulp1 used in immobilization form is a potentially useful tool for cleavage of SUMO-tagged proteins and may reduce time and cost of protein purification.
5cc4ee415e5b3036db1fde6d04e8c3ed32dc55c3	New viral disease such as SARS and H1N1 highlighted the vulnerability of healthcare workers to aerosol-transmitted viral infections. This paper was to assess the protection performance of different level personal respiratory protection equipments against viral aerosol. Surgical masks, N95 masks and N99 masks were purchased from the market. The masks were sealed onto the manikin in the aerosol testing chamber. Viral aerosol was generated and then sampled simultaneously before and after the tested mask using biosamplers. This allows a percentage efficiency value to be calculated against test phage SM702 aerosols which surrogates of viral pathogens aerosol. At the same time, the masks face fit factor was determined by TSI8020. The viral aerosol particles aerodynamic diameter was 0.744 lm, and GSD was 1.29. The protection performance of the material of all the tested masks against viral aerosol was all [95 %. All the five surgical masks face fit factor were \8. F model N95 mask and H model N99 mask face fit factor were all[160. G model N95 mask face fit factor was 8.2. The protection performances of N95 or N99 masks were many times higher than surgical mask when considering the face fit factor. Surgical masks cannot offer sufficient protection against the inhalation of viral aerosol because they cannot provide a close face seal.
fdebb2b0f78abab06a7b1843831fdaa78c3463f7	Background: Air pollution has been a serious health issue in Beijing for years. Airborne antibiotic-resistant bacteria could be a potential health crisis as reserve of antibiotic resistance transmission in environment. The composition and antibiotic resistance pattern of culturable bacterial community and how these are affected by air pollution remain unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the compositions and antibiotic resistance patterns of culturable bacteria in polluted and non-polluted weather conditions in Beijing. Methods: Air samples were collected indoors and outdoors during polluted and non-polluted weather using sixstage Andersen Samplers. For each isolated bacterium, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, sequenced, and blasted against the National Center for Biotechnology Information database Antibiotic resistance was conducted by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Results: Bacterial concentration in polluted weather was significantly higher than in non-polluted weather, both indoors and outdoors (P < 0.05). Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) were dominant in both weathers but gramnegative bacteria (GNB) were more abundant in polluted weather than non-polluted weather both indoors and outdoors. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria occupied 23.7% of all bacterial isolates, 22.4% of isolates from polluted weather and 27.8% of isolates from non-polluted weather. Penicillins were resisted by 72.4% and 83.3% of isolates from polluted and non-polluted weather, respectively. Conclusions: The bacterial concentration was significantly higher in polluted weather, compared to non-polluted weather. Polluted weather is correlated with changes in the bacterial composition in the air, with a greater abundance of GNB. Penicillins was resisted by over 70% of bacterial isolates. The abundance of MDR bacteria suggested potential risks for human health.
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	Background: Simple phenomenological growth models can be useful for estimating transmission parameters and forecasting epidemic trajectories. However, most existing phenomenological growth models only support singlepeak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories. Methods: We develop and apply a novel sub-epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks. We describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse-scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics at finer scales. We evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and four performance metrics. Results: The sub-epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score (MIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval. For example, we demonstrate how the sub-epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Moreover, in short-term sequential forecasts, the sub-epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak, which was not possible using the simple growth models. Furthermore, our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the Ebola epidemic in DRC follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics. Conclusions: Our findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics, including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion, rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics. Unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled, they could also give a false positive, or negative, impression of the impact from public health interventions. These preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases.
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	An immune-adherence hemagglutination (IAHA) method for coronavirus 229E antibody determination has been developed both for diagnosis of recent infections and for detection of long-past infections. Results have been compared with those obtained by complement fixation (CF), neutralization (Nt), and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests. The IAHA method has been shown to be as sensitive as the CF, Nt, and IHA tests in detecting cases of acute 229E infection. However, in a seroepidemiological survey of 343 healthy people of all ages, IAIIA detected 229E antibody in 254 individuals (74.0%), Nt in 166 (48.3%), IHA in 89 (25.Y%), and CF in 30 (8.7%). A study of the prevalence of coronavirus 229E IAHA antibody in the different age groups has shown that during the second decade of life nearly 100% of the population acquire this type of antibody, whereas only 50% are positive at the end of the first decade. In the older age groups, the high frequency of C F antibody ("marker" of recent infection) indirectly confirms the high rate of 229E reinfections and the nonprotective nature of IAHA antibody. C F titer 2 1 :8 in 90% of cases corresponded to IAIIA titers 2 1 :64. However, sera with IAHA titers of 2 1 : 128 were often CF-negative. Recent 2298 infections (or reinfections), as determined by the presence of CF antibody, were more frequent in April-May than in October-November. Three cases of acute infection showing 229E seroconversion (two adults and one child) were observed during the winter-spring season. IAHA appears to be the test of choice for seroepidemiological surveys. Epidemiological surveys carried out in the United States [ 1-31 , England [4], and Brazil [5] indicate that coronavirus 229E infections are worldwide. Studies of prevalence of coronavirus 229E antibody have been performed using complement fixation (CF) [ 6 ] , neutralization (Nt) [l] , and indirect hemagglutination tests (IHA) [7] . CF antibody
e487bb717f5abb466e3db2c2dae2955ecc31cfc7	The study investigated the links between workplace measures implemented in response to COVID-19 with mental health and work performance of employees in Japan. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of a sample from a cohort study of fulltime employees. Participants (n = 1448) completed an online self-report questionnaire on March 19-22, 2020. Multiple linear regression was conducted to ascertain their fear of and worry associated with COVID-19, psychological distress, and work performance. Results: The number of workplace measures correlated positively with respondents' fear of and worry associated with COVID-19 (adjusted standardized β = 0.123, P < .001), negatively with psychological distress and positively with work performance (adjusted standardized β = −0.068, P = .032; adjusted standardized β = 0.101, P = .002; respectively).
4bc6c46e9771f44f720e68026ad582aee5340651	This study aimed to address the gap in the literature through a comprehensive comparison of different types of violations of academic integrity (VAI), cheating, plagiarism, fabrication and facilitation (Pavela in J College Univ Law 24(1):1-22, 1997), conducted in analog versus digital settings, as well as students' and faculty members' perceptions regarding their severity. The study explored differences in perceptions regarding students' VAI and penalties for VAI among 1482 students and 42 faculty members. Furthermore, we explored the impact of socio-demographic characteristics (ethnic majority vs. minority students), gender, and academic degree on the perceived severity of VAI. Presented with a battery of scenarios, participants assessed the severity of penalties imposed by a university disciplinary committee. Furthermore, participants selected the penalties they deemed appropriate for violations engaged in by students, including: reprimanding, financial, academic, and accessibility penalties. All participants tended to suggest more severe penalties for VAI conducted in traditional analog environments than for the same offenses in digital settings. Students perceived all four types of penalties imposed by the disciplinary committee to be significantly more severe than faculty members. Moreover, findings demonstrated a significant difference between faculty and students in both perceptions of the severity of VAI and in relation to suggested punishments. Consistent with the Self-Concept Maintenance Model (Mazar et al. in J Mark Res 45(6):633-644, 2008) and Neutralizing Effect (Brimble, in: Bretag (ed) Handbook of academic integrity, SpringerNature, Singapore, pp 365-382, 2016), ethnic minority students estimated cheating, plagiarism, and facilitation violations as more severe than majority students. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. Extended author information available on the last page of the article I. Blau et al.
5838b6b435db4fdcbc39371939b8a691cf6868d8	Generation and characterization of transgenic mice are important elements of biomedical research. In recent years, transgenic technology has become more versatile and sophisticated, mainly because of the incorporation of recombinase-mediated conditional expression and targeted insertion, site-speci fi c endonuclease-mediated genome editing, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, various inducible gene expression systems, and fl uorescent protein marking and tracking techniques. Site-speci fi c recombinases (such as PhiC31) and engineered endonucleases (such as ZFN and Talen) have signi fi cantly enhanced our ability to target transgenes into speci fi c genomic loci, but currently a great majority of transgenic mouse lines are continuingly being created using the conventional random insertion method. A major challenge for using this conventional method is that the genomic environment at the integration site has a substantial in fl uence on the expression of the transgene. Although our understanding of such chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive, adhering to some general guidelines can signi fi cantly increase the odds of successful transgene expression. This chapter fi rst discusses the major problems associated with transgene expression, and then describes some of the principles for using plasmid and bacterial arti fi cial chromosomes (BACs) for generating transgenic constructs. Finally, the strategies for conducting each of the major types of transgenic research are discussed, including gene overexpression, promoter characterization, cell-lineage tracing, mutant complementation, expression of double or multiple transgenes, siRNA knockdown, and conditional and inducible systems.
0bb3b357f41b31c5340a6391a3e481cafd9a74af	Pyogranulomatous inflammation has been extensively described in cats, in particular in cases of feline infectious peritonitis and also associated with Mycobacteria, Actinomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus and fungal infections. Idiopathic sterile pyogranulomatous dermatitis has also been described. In this case series we describe the clinical presentation, histopathology and outcome of three cases of feline idiopathic sterile steroid-responsive pyogranuloma with different presentation and different locations of the lesion, but with the common feature of having a mass with no superficial skin involvement.
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	This study aims to provide an accessible and dynamic estimate method to project the Covid-19 trend and hopefully it will help inform policymakers to allocate the needed medical equipment and supplies for saving more lives. A set of newly developed Pandemic Projection Measures (PPM) had been successfully applied to project daily new cases across countries. During the development, numerous trial and error iterations had been performed and then improved with live data. The procedures and computations for the PPM including Uphill Index (UHI), Downhill Indices (DHI), and Error Band Projection (EBP) estimates were explained and discussed along with graphical projections. China. The results indicated that with the PPM estimations, the daily projections for the future trend were robust to reflect the most plausibility, since the PPM can be updated frequently. With the most up-to-date predictions, governments should be able to monitor the values of UHI and DHI for making a better decision for "flattening the curve". Based on the empirical data, policymakers should pay more attentions for the following two scenarios: a) When expecting an apex of the outbreak, the UHI is higher than 1.20; and b) After passing a peak day, the DHI is still larger than 0.925. The applications of the PPM estimates are not designed for a one-time projection rather than updated frequently to improve the prediction precisions. With the same concepts from the PPM computations, the peak day and the number of new deaths could be predictable if more data are collected. Like many country leaders saying, "We will win the battle of coronavirus pandemic", the author hopes to use this easily applicable estimate method to save more lives and to win. The results, currently presented with the data on April 16 and 17, 2020, were only used to explain how to apply the PPM estimates for predictions. The outdated results should not be used to compared with today's outbreak trend.
2d763661e6ae0aba4cd21109c67c5b0133ba946e	Human rhinovirus (HRV) is one of the most common human respiratory pathogens and is responsible for the majority of upper respiratory illnesses. Recently, a phylogeny was constructed from all known American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HRV sequences. From this study, three HRV classifications (HRVA, HRVB, and HRVC) were determined and techniques for classifying new isolates of HRV were reported. The genetic change of this virus in specific populations over time is of great interest to understand the evolution and epidemiology of viruses. To facilitate the collections of HRV sequences over a number of years, a virology experiment was designed in which students test nasal lavage samples to look for HRV infection. Students will learn a variety of techniques including RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis as well as bioinformatic skills though examination of sequences from the HRV-field isolates. Furthermore, students can look at symptom data from subjects to investigate correlations between symptom severity and factors such as stress and sleep patterns. Such information can be used to examine hypotheses regarding HRV mutation, symptom severity and epidemiology.
9110b6136dafccd5110c9d56f30e97b5356afa7b	Aim: SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been confirmed as the pathogen for severe acute respirato-Abstract ry syndrome (SARS). The aim of our study was to construct a sensitive and specific real-time quantitative fluorescent (QF) reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR method for the detection of SARS-CoV RNA. Methods: Stored blood specimens from 44 patients with confirmed SARS were used along with blood samples from two sets of controls, 30 healthy volunteers who had no contact with SARS patients, and 30 healthy doctors and nurses who had contact with SARS patients but were without symptoms of SARS. Two pairs of primers were synthesized by the Shanghai Sangon Company according to SARS-CoV BJ01 strain sequence (AY278488), and then a pair of primers were designed and compared with a pair of primers published by WHO. Results: Using serial dilutions of SARS-CoV, the 44 blood samples from SARS patients specimens were tested. Using a 0.01% dilution of SARS-CoV, all 44 clinical samples tested positive in our assay. In comparison, using a 0.1% dilution of SARS-CoV, 26 of the 44 samples tested positive using the WHO primers. In the QF-RT-PCR assay, there was a linear amplification from 100 copies to 10 8 copies of the control RNA per RT-PCR and at least 10 copies, and sometimes even 1 copy, of target RNA tested positive in our assay. Conclusion: The primer we developed is sufficiently sensitive and specific to diagnose symptomatic SARS-CoV infections and for monitoring virus load.
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	Swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a novel coronavirus, was first discovered in southern China in January 2017 and caused a large scale outbreak of fatal diarrheal disease in piglets. Here, we conducted a retrospective investigation of 236 samples from 45 swine farms with a clinical history of diarrheal disease to evaluate the emergence and the distribution of SADS-CoV in pigs in China. Our results suggest that SADS-CoV has emerged in China at least since August 2016. Meanwhile, we detected a prevalence of SADS-CoV (43.53%), porcine deltacoronavirus (8.83%), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) (78.25%), rotavirus (21.77%), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (0%), and we also found the co-infection of SADS-CoV and PEDV occurred most frequently with the rate of 17.65%. We screened and obtained two new complete genomes, five N and five S genes of SADS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis based on these sequences revealed that all SADS-CoV sequences in this study clustered with previously reported SADS-CoV strains to form a well defined branch that grouped with the bat coronavirus HKU2 strains. This study is the first retrospective investigation for SADS-CoV and provides the epidemiological information of this new virus in China, which highlights the urgency to develop effective measures to control SADS-CoV.
318a5c6daa222c6b300d42168f20a53e14a6e33a	Long-range transport (LRT) of air pollutants from East Asia during the northeast monsoon season impacts several downwind locations. In 2020, the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in China overlapped with Week 3 of the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday, and an Asian outflow event. Thus, movement of the Chinese populace from city to city was already greatly reduced by the time of the LRT episode, although the reductions in industrial output are less clear. We found NO 2 column concentrations were reduced by 24% during the CNY Week 3 this year compared to previous years. The attenuated transport event arrived to northern Taiwan with a PM 2.5 concentration less than 45 μg m -3 and most often less than 35 μg m -3 , which is 2-3 times lower than LRT episodes of similar back-trajectory and synoptic patterns. The whole episode persisted for about 60 h, longer than most LRT episodes from China to Taiwan. CMAQ v5.2.1 modeling of the LRT event with 100% emission and reduced emission scenarios, revealed emissions in China were approximately 50% less than normal periods. Due to the length of the episode and the significant reduction in emissions, Taiwan avoided a PM 2.5 surplus of 19.2 μg m -3 on average during the episode, equivalent to a 0.5 μg m -3 reduction for the whole 3-month winter season. Employing the 100% emission model scenario and scaling up to the average episode hours each winter, the PM 2.5 surplus delivered via plumes on the northeast monsoon is equivalent to a 0.5 μg m -3 surplus for the whole year.

e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	Background and Objectives Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has recently been the subject of intense debate regarding its potential antiviral activity against SARS-Cov-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19. Some report possible curative effects; others do not. Therefore, the objective of this study was to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients using mathematical modeling. Methods To shed some light on this controversial topic, we simulated hydroxychloroquine-based interventions on virus/host cell dynamics using a basic system of previously published differential equations. Mathematical modeling was implemented using Python programming language v 3.7. Results According to mathematical modeling, hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak and viral clearance if the drug is administered early enough (i.e., when the virus is still confined within the pharyngeal cavity). The effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine may be fully explained only when also considering the capacity of this drug to increase the death rate of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, in this case by enhancing the cell-mediated immune response. Conclusions These considerations may not only be applied to chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine but may have more general implications for development of anti-COVID-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies through an increased death rate of the infected cells.
b9bda4ac723da46f0a97cb515f56fcdb1588f162	Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against two major structural proteins of the cell-adapted Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus (BCV-L9) were produced and characterized. Seven MAbs reacted with the peplomeric glycoprotein, gplOO/S, while three MAbs reacted with the nucleoprotein p53/N in Western blot analysis of BCV polypeptides. MAbs to gplOO/S reacted with discontinuous epitopes of gplOO/S in Westerns under mild but not under standard denaturing conditions. In contrast, MAbs to p53/N reacted in both types of Westerns, and those epitopes were thus continuous. MAbs to p53/N failed to neutralize BCV infectivity, while 4 MAbs to gplOO/S neutralized BCV effectively. Cross reactivity of MAbs to gplOO/S specified by five virulent wild-type strains and two high passage, cell-culture-adapted strains in mildly denaturing Westerns and neutralization assays indicated that two epitopes were conserved in all seven strains, while two epitopes of the avirulent strains were not detected in the wild-type strains. Non-neutralizing MAbs of gplOO/S reacted with all seven strains in Westerns with the exception of one MAb that was specific for the highly cell-adapted strain BCV-L9.
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	The etiology of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system remains unknown and likely involves a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggering factors. Given that exposure to numerous infectious pathogens occurs during childhood, and that some viral infections can lead to neurodegeneration and demyelination, it is conceivable that some viruses may act as triggering factors in neuropathogenesis. We have previously shown that the prototype OC43 strain of the common cold-associated human respiratory coronavirus has the capacity to infect human neuronal and glial cells and does persist in human brains. Moreover, it has neuroinvasive properties in susceptible BALB/c mice, where it leads to a chronic encephalitis with accompanying disabilities. Here, we show that mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein, reproducibly acquired during viral persistence in human neural cell cultures, led to a drastically modified virus-induced neuropathology in BALB/c mice, characterized by flaccid paralysis and demyelination. Even though infection by both mutated and wild-type viruses led to neuroinflammation, the modified neuropathogenesis induced by the mutated virus was associated with increased viral spread and significantly more CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system, as well as significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 and the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1). Moreover, recombinant virus harboring the S glycoprotein mutations retained its neurotropism, productively infecting neurons. Therefore, interaction of a human respiratory coronavirus with the central nervous system may modulate virus and host factors resulting in a modified neuropathogenesis in genetically susceptible individuals.

33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	Negative pressure isolation rooms are used to house patients with highly contagious diseases (e.g. with airborne diseases) and to contain emitted pathogens to reduce the risk for cross-infection in hospitals. Airflows induced by door opening motion and healthcare worker passage can, however, transport the potentially pathogen laden air across the doorway. In this study airflow patterns across the isolation room doorway induced by the operation of single hinged and sliding doors with simulated human passage were examined. Smoke visualizations demonstrated that the hinged door opening generated a greater flow across the doorway than the sliding door. Tracer gas measurements showed that the examined ventilation rates (6 and 12 air changes per hour) had only a small effect on the air volume exchange across the doorway with the hinged door. The results were more variable with the sliding door. Supply-exhaust flow rate differential reduced the door motion-induced air transfer significantly with both door types. The experiments showed that the passage induced substantial air volume transport through the doorway with both door types. However, overall, the sliding door performed better in all tested scenarios, because the door-opening motion itself generated relatively smaller air volume exchange across the doorway, and hence should be the preferred choice in the design of isolation rooms.
595d8e5713b0116c5fd508970bb6386341336ed6	Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are characterised by a neutrophilic mucosal infiltration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the time course of release of the cytokines/chemokines interleukins (IL) IL-1β, IL-1ra, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and bradykinin in nasal secretions of patients with a naturally acquired URTI. A total of 117 healthy adult volunteers were recruited for baseline nasal lavages, 39 of whom developed URTI symptoms within 6 months and returned to our centre within 48 h. Lavages were performed daily during the symptomatic period and 3 weeks thereafter, with symptoms no longer present. Compared to baseline, significantly elevated concentrations of total protein, bradykinin, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, IFN-γ, MPO and sICAM-1 were detected in nasal lavage fluids of symptomatic patients, whereas IL-1ra remained unaltered. All studied variables reached baseline 3 weeks after the URTI. Naturally acquired URTI represent a limited, neutrophilic inflammatory reaction, orchestrated by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Obtained results show the LRC character in the most sequences; except some sequences where the anti-correlated or the Classical Brownian motion character is observed. Obtained results demonstrate show that the SARS-Cov2 coronavirus undergoes mutation from a country to another or in the same country.
4a86a65703f8585535ef011952aea59ba1271c3f	Surgical site infections are a common source of post-operative morbidity and contribute significantly to healthcare costs. Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy and/or bowel surgery are particularly at risk. Prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been shown to reduce wound infection. However, to date, there has been a lack of consensus around its use for closed laparotomy wounds. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials comparing the use of prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy with standard dressings for closed laparotomy incisions. The primary outcome was incidence of incisional surgical site infection (SSI) at 30 days post-operatively. Secondary outcomes included superficial and deep SSI, skin dehiscence, fascial dehiscence and length of stay. A total of 2182 publications were identified, of which, following review of titles, abstracts and full texts, five studies met the criteria for inclusion. Across these studies, 467 patients were randomised to NPWT and 464 to standard dressings. Overall SSI rate was 18.6% (n = 87/467) versus 23.9% (n = 111/464) in the NPWT and standard dressing groups, respectively (Odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.99, p = 0.04*). Deep SSI incidence was the same in both groups (2.6%). Both skin dehiscence and fascial dehiscence were slightly higher in the standard dressing group ((4.2%, n = 11/ 263 versus 3.1% (n = 8/261) and (0.9% (n = 3/324) versus 0.6% (n = 2/323)), respectively. This study observed that NPWT reduces the overall SSI for closed laparotomy wounds. It supports data recommending the use of prophylactic NPWT dressings, especially in high-risk patients in both emergency and elective circumstances.

Similarly, a report from France with 181 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia found no difference in terms of mortality and ICU admission in patients treated with HCQ compared to the standard of care [5] . Importantly, as COVID-19 treatments require testing and monitoring, these results underscore the need for close monitoring of these patients under the guidance of an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP).

1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) viruses are a major cause of disease and economic loss in pigs worldwide. High genetic diversity among PRRSV strains is problematic for successful disease control by vaccination. Mosaic DNA and vaccinia (VACV) vaccines were developed in order to improve protection against heterologous PRRSV strains. Methods: Piglets were primed and boosted with GP5-Mosaic DNA vaccine and recombinant GP5-Mosaic VACV (rGP5-Mosaic VACV), respectively. Pigs vaccinated with rGP5-WT (VR2332) DNA and rGP5-WT VACV, or empty vector DNA and empty VACV respectively, served as controls. Virus challenge was given to separate groups of vaccinated pigs with VR2332 or MN184C. Necropsies were performed 14 days after challenge. Results: Vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic-based vaccines resulted in cellular reactivity and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies to both VR2332 and MN184C PRRSV strains. In contrast, vaccination of animals with the GP5-WT vaccines induced responses only to VR2332. Furthermore, vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic based vaccines resulted in protection against challenge with two heterologous virus strains, as demonstrated by the significantly lower viral loads in serum, tissues, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, and less severe lung lesions after challenge with either MN184C or VR2332, which have only 85% identity. In contrast, significant protection by the GP5-WT based vaccines was only achieved against the VR2332 strain. Conclusions: GP5-Mosaic vaccines, using a DNA-prime/VACV boost regimen, conferred protection in pigs against heterologous viruses.
4db2df55a70768d8e0351d22e9036f1a10b56b71	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Salmonella choleraesuis are two leading causes of economic loss in the swine industry. While respiratory disease is common in both S. choleraesuis and PRRSV infections, the factors that contribute to its development remain largely unde®ned. We investigated the interaction of PRRSV, S. choleraesuis, and stress in 5-weekold swine. All combinations of three factors (inoculation with S. choleraesuis on Day 0, PRRSV on Day 3, and treatment with dexamethasone on Days 3±7) were used to produce eight treatment groups in two independent trials. Fecal samples, tonsil and nasal swabs, serum samples and postmortem tissues were collected for bacteriologic and virologic examinations. No clinical signs were observed in pigs inoculated with only PRRSV or only S. choleraesuis. In contrast, pigs which were dually infected with S. choleraesuis and PRRSV exhibited unthriftiness, rough hair coats, dyspnea, and diarrhea. The pigs which received all three treatment factors were the most severely affected and 43% (three of seven) of the animals in this group died. Individuals in this group shed signi®cantly higher quantities of S. choleraesuis in feces and had signi®cantly higher serum PRRSV Veterinary Microbiology 71 (2000) 177±192 : S 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 ( 9 9 ) 0 0 1 7 5 -3 titers compared to other treatments (p 0.05). In addition, S. choleraesuis and PRRSV were shed longer and by more pigs in this group than other groups and S. choleraesuis was recovered from more tissues in this group on Day 21 post inoculation. These results suggested that PRRSV, S. choleraesuis, and dexamethasone acted synergistically to produce a syndrome similar to that observed in the ®eld. #
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	Infectious diseases (ID) circulating in the home and community remain a significant concern. Several demographic, environmental, and health care trends, as reviewed in this report, are combining to make it likely that the threat of ID will increase in coming years. Two factors are largely responsible for this trend: first, the constantly changing nature and range of pathogens to which we are exposed and, secondly, the demographic changes occurring in the community, which affect our resistance to infection. This report reviews the evidence base related to the impact of hand hygiene in reducing transmission of ID in the home and community. The report focuses on developed countries, most particularly North America and Europe. It also evaluates the use of alcohol-based hygiene procedures as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, handwashing. The report compiles data from intervention studies and considers it alongside risk modeling approaches (both qualitative and quantitative) based on microbiologic data. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Hand hygiene is a key component of good hygiene practice in the home and community and can produce significant benefits in terms of reducing the incidence of infection, most particularly gastrointestinal infections but also respiratory tract and skin infections. (2) Decontamination of hands can be carried out either by handwashing with soap or by use of waterless hand sanitizers, which reduce contamination on hands by removal or by killing the organisms in situ. The health impact of hand hygiene within a given community can be increased by using products and procedures, either alone or in sequence, that maximize the log reduction of both bacteria and viruses on hands. (3) The impact of hand hygiene in reducing ID risks could be increased by convincing people to apply hand hygiene procedures correctly (eg, wash their hands correctly) and at the correct time. (4) To optimize health benefits, promotion of hand hygiene should be accompanied by hygiene education and should also involve promotion of other aspects of hygiene.

No disclosure of prior presentation of study data as an abstract or poster ABSTRACT Background: Over the last months, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of chilblain-like lesions was reported mainly in children, rarely in young adults. The relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection was postulated, often without any laboratory, instrumental or clinical confirmation. The disclosure of information about chilblain-like lesions as a COVID-19 manifestation in social media has created concern in children's families and pediatricians Objectives: to verify whether the chilblain-like lesions were caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: prospective study on a case series including children who presented with acral lesions at the Pediatric Dermatology Outpatient and Pediatric Emergency Unit of the University of Bologna, from April 1 to April 30, 2020. We reported demographical, laboratory and clinical features, history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, presence of similar skin lesions in other family members, precipitating and risk factors for chilblain onset. We evaluated 8 patients (5 females, 3 males) aged between 11 and 15 years. We excluded acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab, serum antibody levels using chemiluminescent immunoassays. Other acute infections causing purpuric lesions at the extremities were negative in all patients. Skin lesion biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was made in two cases and was consistent with chilblain. PCR-assay on skin lesion biopsy for Parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a patient and resulted negative. We identified common precipitating and risk factors: physical (cold and wet extremities, low BMI), cold and wet indoor and outdoor environment, behaviors, habits, lifestyle. We therefore reached a diagnosis of primary chilblains. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a "cluster" of primary chilblains developed in predisposed subjects, mainly teenagers, due to to cold exposure in the lockdown period. Laboratory findings support our hypothesis, although it is also possible that an unknown infectious This article is protected by copyright.

3f816a1cbb4ad735a54792bf22fb55fe51b849c2	This paper presents a two-stage Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the arrival time of In-Process Control (IPC) samples at the quality testing laboratories of a chemical company. The model was developed using three iterations of the CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, each focusing on a different regression approach. To reduce the ML analyst effort, an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) was adopted during the modeling stage of CRISP-DM. The AutoML was set to select the best among six distinct state-of-the-art regression algorithms. Using recent real-world data, the three main regression approaches were compared, showing that the proposed two-stage ML model is competitive and provides interesting predictions to support the laboratory management decisions (e.g., preparation of testing instruments). In particular, the proposed method can accurately predict 70% of the examples under a tolerance of 4 time units.
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	Our ability to respond appropriately to infectious diseases is enhanced by identifying differences in the potential for transmitting infection between individuals. Here, we identify epidemiological traits of self-limited infections (i.e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying 0vR eff v1) that correlate with transmissibility. Our analysis is based on a branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases. Our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios, including the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian peninsula, measles in North America, pre-eradication smallpox in Europe, and human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When applied to chain size data for MERS-CoV transmission before 2014, our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control, there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that R eff has declined with time. Meanwhile, chain size data for measles in the United States and Canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in R eff , suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs, as well as contact tracing procedures, may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters. Infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases, and provides a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of control interventions. Human monkeypox, on the other hand, does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans, primary cases, or secondary cases, which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases. Lastly, we evaluate surveillance requirements for detecting a change in the human-to-human transmission of monkeypox since the cessation of cross-protective smallpox vaccination. Our studies lay the foundation for future investigations regarding how infection source, vaccination status or other putative transmissibility traits may affect self-limited transmission.
3bd5e582f0bad1859d9f86168684194221a93c50	Since Pascal introduced the idea of mathematical probability in the 17th century discussions of uncertainty and "rational" belief have been dogged by philosophical and technical disputes. Furthermore, the last quarter century has seen an explosion of new questions and ideas, stimulated by developments in the computer and cognitive sciences. Competing ideas about probability are often driven by different intuitions about the nature of belief that arise from the needs of different domains (e.g., economics, management theory, engineering, medicine, the life sciences etc). Taking medicine as our focus we develop three lines of argument (historical, practical and cognitive) that suggest that traditional views of probability cannot accommodate all the competing demands and diverse constraints that arise in complex real-world domains. A model of uncertain reasoning based on a form of logical argumentation appears to unify many diverse ideas. The model has precursors in informal discussions of argumentation due to Toulmin, and the notion of logical probability advocated by Keynes, but recent developments in artificial intelligence and cognitive science suggest ways of resolving epistemological and technical issues that they could not address.

9b62193f278ef828f6ae2c531ecf029da2d58d43	Background. The susceptibility of patients with rheumatic diseases, and the risks or benefits of immunosuppressive therapies for COVID-19 are unknown. We performed a retrospective study with patients under follow-up in rheumatology departments from seven hospitals in Spain. We matched updated databases of rheumatology patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR tests performed in the hospital to the same reference populations. Incidences of PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 were compared among groups. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR+ COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%). Systemic autoimmune or immune mediated diseases (AI/IMID) patients showed a significant increase, whereas inflammatory arthritis (IA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients did not. COVID-19 cases in some but not all diagnostic groups had older ages than cases in the reference population. IA patients on targeted-synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts/bDMARD), but not those on conventional-synthetic (csDMARD), had a greater prevalence despite a similar age distribution. Patients with AI/IMID show a variable risk of hospital diagnosed COVID-19. Interplay of aging, therapies, and disease specific factors seem to contribute. These data provide a basis to improve preventive recommendations to rheumatic patients and to analyze the specific factors involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.
b01be64ab1df7d3380ea2265741fc2a3ea76e496	The Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) outbreak spread rapidly in Italy and the lack of intensive care unit(ICU) beds soon became evident, forcing the application of noninvasive respiratory support(NRS) outside the ICU, raising concerns over staff contamination. We aimed to analyze the safety of the hospital staff, the feasibility, and outcomes of NRS applied to patients outside the ICU. In this observational study, data from 670 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 referred to the Pulmonology Units in nine hospitals between March 1 st and May 10 th ,2020 were analyzed. Data were collected including medication, mode and usage of the NRS (i.e. high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation(NIV)), length of stay in hospital, endotracheal intubation(ETI) and deaths. Results: Forty-two health-care workers (11.4%) tested positive for infection, but only three of them required hospitalization. Data are reported for all patients (69.3% male), whose mean age was 68 (SD 13) years. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at baseline was 152+79, and the majority of patients (49.3%) were treated with CPAP. The overall unadjusted 30-day mortality rate was 26.9% with 16%, 30%, and 30%, while the total ETI rate was 27% with 29%, 25% and 28%, for HFNC, CPAP, and NIV, respectively, and the relative probability to die was not related to the NRS used after adjustment for confounders. ETI and length of stay were not different among the groups. Mortality rate increased with age and comorbidity class progression. The application of NRS outside the ICU is feasible and associated with favourable outcomes. Nonetheless, it was associated with a risk of staff contamination.
4a1c3861b087a7c75ac475050c0943a61a02a0b9	We report a case of an adult patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria that was successfully managed with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Case report: A 25 year old male with no significant past medical history had been admitted to a local hospital due to dyspnea and fever. His pulmonary function subsequently failed necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV) and introduction of ECMO support. The patient was transported for 300 km by road on ECMO to a tertiary medical center. The diagnosis of ARDS, HIV infection and MDR bacterial and fungal VAP was made. Patient was successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), anti-infective agents and 58 days of veno-venous ECMO support, with complete resolution of the respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: HIV infected patients with ARDS and MDR bacterial VAP whose HIV replication is controlled by ART could be successfully managed with ECMO.
49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus which encodes two surface glycoproteins: the receptor-binding protein G and the fusion protein F. As for all paramyxoviruses, proteolytic activation of the NiV-F protein is an indispensable prerequisite for viral infectivity. Interestingly, proteolytic activation of NiV-F differs principally from other paramyxoviruses with respect to protease usage (cathepsins instead of trypsin-or furin-like proteases), and the subcellular localization where cleavage takes place (endosomes instead of Golgi or plasma membrane). To allow efficient F protein activation needed for productive virus replication and cell-to-cell fusion, the NiV-F cytoplasmic tail contains a classical tyrosinebased endocytosis signal (Y 525 RSL) that we have shown earlier to be needed for F uptake and proteolytic activation. In this report, we furthermore revealed that an intact endocytosis signal alone is not sufficient for full bioactivity. The very C-terminus of the cytoplasmic tail is needed in addition. Deletions of more than four residues did not affect F uptake or endosomal cleavage but downregulated the surface expression, likely by delaying the intracellular trafficking through endosomal-recycling compartments. Given that the NiV-F cytoplasmic tail is needed for timely and correct intracellular trafficking, endosomal cleavage and fusion activity, the influence of tail truncations on NiV-mediated cell-to-cell fusion and on pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is discussed.
f1cd60ea6bc145fd5bf6d2974af94b636609b589	were compared between disproportionately (>13%) black and all other (<13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with countylevel data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2,465) and 28% (684/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with <13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with >13% black residents.
b0a6ed483bc608a977382c0781fdf31c73d28771	The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that zoonotic transmission of animal coronaviruses (CoV) to humans poses a significant threat to public health and warrants surveillance and the development of countermeasures. The activity of host cell proteases, which cleave and activate the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, is essential for viral infectivity and constitutes a target for intervention. However, the identities of the proteases involved have been unclear. Pioneer studies identified cathepsins and type II transmembrane serine proteases as cellular activators of SARS-CoV and demonstrated that several emerging viruses might exploit these enzymes to promote their spread.

793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	Ebolavirus (EBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV) that compose the filovirus family of negative strand RNA viruses infect a broad range of mammalian cells. Recent studies indicate that cellular entry of this family of viruses requires a series of cellular protein interactions and molecular mechanisms, some of which are unique to filoviruses and others are commonly used by all viral glycoproteins. Details of this entry pathway are highlighted here. Virus entry into cells is initiated by the interaction of the viral glycoprotein 1 subunit (GP 1 ) with both adherence factors and one or more receptors on the surface of host cells. On epithelial cells, we recently demonstrated that TIM-1 serves as a receptor for this family of viruses, but the cell surface receptors in other cell types remain unidentified. Upon receptor binding, the virus is internalized into endosomes primarily via macropinocytosis, but perhaps by other mechanisms as well. Within the acidified endosome, the heavily glycosylated GP 1 is cleaved to a smaller form by the low pH-dependent cellular proteases Cathepsin L and B, exposing residues in the receptor binding site (RBS). Details of the molecular events following cathepsin-dependent trimming of GP 1 are currently incomplete; however, the processed GP 1 specifically interacts with endosomal/lysosomal membranes that contain the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) protein and expression of NPC1 is required for productive infection, suggesting that GP/NPC1 interactions may be an important late step in the entry process. Additional events such as further GP 1 processing and/or reducing events may also be required to generate a fusion-ready form of the glycoprotein. Once this has been achieved, sequences in the filovirus GP 2 subunit mediate viral/cellular membrane fusion via mechanisms similar to those previously described for other enveloped viruses. This multi-step entry pathway Viruses 2012, 4 259 highlights the complex and highly orchestrated path of internalization and fusion that appears unique for filoviruses.
bd7a4446bdf5e718b52f296cb49561b22555ce5a	Purpose During the COVID-19 pandemic, most breast surgery for benign and malignant conditions has been postponed, creating a backlog of patients who will need surgery. A fair and transparent system for assessing the risk of further delaying surgery for individual patients to prioritize surgical scheduling is needed. Methods Factors related to risk of delaying surgery for breast patients were identified. Scores were assigned to each factor, with higher scores indicating a greater risk from delaying surgery. REDCap and Microsoft Excel tools were designed to track and score delayed patients. Results Published data and multidisciplinary clinical judgement were used to assign risk scores based on patient and tumor factors, length of delay, and tumor response to preoperative therapy. Patients completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assigned the highest scores as their options for delaying surgery are most limited. Among patients receiving neoadjuvant endocrine therapy or no medical therapy, higher scores were assigned for low-estrogen receptor or high-genomic risk scores, higher grade, larger tumors, younger age and longer delay. High priority scores were assigned for progression during preoperative therapy. Low scores were assigned for re-excisions, atypical lesions and other benign indications. There was good agreement of the tool's ranking of sample patients with rankings by experienced clinicians. The tool generates risk-stratified patient lists by surgeon or institution to facilitate assignment of surgery dates. Conclusions This tool generates a clinically consistent, risk-stratified priority list of breast surgical procedures delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic approach may facilitate surgical scheduling as conditions normalize.
6eb5dc7405ff754df5fa10b64a7dba74b2be84d7	From the beginning of the year 2020, the world was affected by a coronavirus disease pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, leading to a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) at a global level, and thus generating exposure of health professionals to this extremely contagious virus. Within this context, the present work seeks to present an alternative for the production of face shields ''face shields,'' in which it recommends its production ''in house'' through 3D printing, in principle initiated by Prusa Research, where we download your project of support of facial protectors, proceeding with printing through the 3D printer Gtmax3D Core H5. The authors produced a face shield in ABS, in a total time of 3 hours and 44 minutes. Thus, the model presented proved to be feasible, at a low cost, adding to the list of possibilities to produce inputs necessary to maintain the fight against this epidemic.
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	Disease transmission and behavior change are both fundamentally social phenomena. Behavior change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favor the more rapid adoption of behavioral innovations. We analyze a simple model 3 of coupled behavior-change and infection in a structured population characterized by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and leads to bifurcation when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When the rates of adoption differ by 6 group, high outgroup aversion causes the later-adopting group to have a lower equilibrium adoption fraction, even when the behavior is highly desirable. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behavior-adoption model, a wide variety of dynamics are possible. Homophily can either 9 increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and R 0 for the infection. When R 0 ≈ 1 and homophily is strong in the second group, it can be protective for this group. However, when R 0 1, we find that strong homophily in 12 the second group, together with outgroup aversion, can lead to a much larger epidemic in that group. Similarly, if the first group is homophilic and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce a "second wave" in 15 the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. In general, adding outgroup aversion to a population characterized by homophily can result in paradoxical failure to adopt behavior that is protective from infection. These simple models reveal complex dynamics 18 that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarized populations such as the United States. for cumulative culture, and particularly to the rapid and flexible adaptability that arises
d0bf59283a2836365a2c8102b9d753aece18a3ab	Cell culture-LNCaP FGC, CWR22Rv1, PC-3, DU145, HEK293A and CHO cells were originally obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were tested and authenticated by genetic profiling using short tandem repeat analysis. LNCaP FGC, DU145, CWR22Rv1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM Lglutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. PC-3, HEK293A, CHO cells were maintained in DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Cell proliferation assay-For LNCaP cells, cells were plated at a density of 4x10 4 cells per well within 500 ml regular medium in a 24-well plate. Cell growth was measured at each time point using counting chamber examination. Cells were trypsinized and stained with trypan blue to count live cell numbers. For PC-3 and DU145 cells, cells were seeded at a density of 2x10 3 in a well of 96well plates. The media were refreshed every two days. Cell growth was measured at each time point using the MTT assays. 0.5 mg/mL MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma-Aldrich, USA] in medium were added to each well and incubated with cells for 30 minutes. After 2 incubation, media were discarded; the formazan dye trapped in cells was dissolved in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used to measure the absorbance of the DMSOextracted solution at the wavelength of 570 nm. Western blot-After washing twice with cold PBS, cells were lyzed with a RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM DTNB, and protease inhibitor cocktails). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations of each sample were determined by Protein Assay solution (BioRad, CA, USA) with reference to a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve. After adding Laemmli sample buffer, fifty micrograms of proteins per well were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST, and incubated with primary antibodies in 5% skim milk with gentle shaking at 4°C. Next day, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Horseradish peroxidase (Jackson, PA, USA) in 5% skim milk TBST. The target proteins were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce, IL, USA) and detected by a luminescent image analyzer with

ab8da309a4060c4f4a3774c3ec9e7ebdc5a3a74e	Introduction: Natalizumab blocks α4-integrins and is a prototypic agent for a series of anti-inflammatory drugs that impair trafficking of immune cells into the CNS. However, modulation of the access of immune cells to the CNS is associated with impaired immune surveillance and detrimental viral infections of the CNS. Here, we explored the potency of cellular immune responses within the CNS to protect against viral encephalitis in mice with T cell conditional disruption of VLA-4 integrin (α4β1) expression. Results: While VLA-4 expression in virus specific Th1 cells is non-redundant for their ability to access the CNS, α4-integrin deficient Th17 cells enter the CNS compartment and generate an inflammatory milieu upon intrathecal vaccinia virus (VV) infection. However, in contrast to Th1 cells that can adopt direct cytotoxic properties, Th17 cells fail to clear the virus due to insufficient Eomes induced perforin-1 expression. Conclusion: The quality of the intrathecal cellular antiviral response under conditions of impaired VLA-4 function jeopardizes host protection. Our functional in vivo data extend our mechanistic understanding of anti-viral immunity in the CNS and help to estimate the risk potential of upcoming therapeutic agents that target the trafficking of immune cells into distinct anatomical compartments.
4b6924e8a47cd58844905f4ce2a134e44783d68b	Objective: This study describes the preventive measures adopted by the Spanish population towards 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus and their associated factors. Method: An anonymous computer-assisted telephone interview survey was conducted in Spain in December 2009 and February 2010. Respondents were asked about their perceptions of influenza A (H1N1) virus and the preventive measures adopted. Factors associated with the adoption of preventive measures were assessed by logistic regression analyses. Results: Out of 4892 households approached, 1627 valid responses were obtained (response rate of 33.3%). The most commonly adopted preventive measures were respiratory hygiene and hand washing. Factors independently associated with the adoption of the preventive measures recommended by the Spanish Ministry of Health were female gender, higher educational level, size of municipality of residence N 50,000 inhabitants, high perceived susceptibility to infection, high perceived effectiveness of the measures and high perceived usefulness of the information provided by the government. The presence of school-aged children in household was associated with purchasing masks and hand sanitizer. Conclusion: In addition to demographic factors, modifiable factors such as personal beliefs and expectations play a role in the adoption of preventive measures.

879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	Adenoviruses are double-strained DNA viruses found in a great number of vertebrates, including humans. In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are important reservoirs for adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females, due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend across species, we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances for two of the three studied bat species (P. pygmaeus and P.kuhlii). These results increase our knowledge about the transmission mechanisms of adenoviruses. PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide. To date, no specific drug for COVID-19 has been developed. Thus we performed this randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029853) in China. A total of 20 mild and common COVID-19 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive azvudine and symptomatic treatment (FNC group), or standard antiviral and symptomatic treatments (control group). The mean times of the first nucleic acid negative conversion (NANC) of 10 patients in the FNC group and 10 patients in the control group were 2.60 (SD 0.97; range 1-4) days and 5.60 (SD 3.06; range 2-13) days, respectively (p=0.08). The mean times of the first NANC of 4 newly diagnosed subjects in the FNC group and 10 subjects in the control group were 2.50 (SD 1.00; range 2-4) days and 9.80 (SD 4.73; range 3-19) days, respectively (starting from the initial treatment) (p= 0.01). No adverse events occurred in the FNC group, while 3 adverse events occurred in the control group (p=0.06). The preliminary results showed that FNC treatment in the mild and common COVID-19 may shorten the NANC time versus standard antiviral treatment. Therefore, clinical trials of FNC treating COVID-19 with larger sample size are warranted. This article is protected by copyright.

3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a	DNA sequences seen in the normal character-based representation appear to have a formidable mixing of the four nucleotides without any apparent order. Nucleotide frequencies and distributions in the sequences have been studied extensively, since the simple rule given by Chargaff almost a century ago that equates the total number of purines to the pyrimidines in a duplex DNA sequence. While it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a DNA sequence, graphical representations may provide a clue. These novel representations of DNA sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures. We report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales. From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences. Such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron-late phenomena.
b978b2bceb9292106d021315a94a21dd3f9ecce2	Meningoradiculitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 2. -A 24-yearold immune-competent woman was admitted to hospital with a three-day history of fever and headache. On examination bilateral facial nerve palsy, lumbosacral radicular pain, reduced sacral sensibility and urinary retention were found. Open perianal lesions were suspect for genital herpes. The symptoms were compatible with a meningoradiculitis including a sacral polyradiculitis. On testing, cerebrospinal fluid was found to be abnormal with a lymphocytic cell reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid and of the perianal lesions was positive for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). An MRI scan showed colouration of part of the cauda equina. The patient was treated by intravenous injections of acyclovir 10 mg/kg t.i.d. for 21 days, after which she completely recovered. HSV-2 infection of the nervous system can cause lymphocytic, and sometimes recurrent meningitis as well as sacral polyradiculitis. It may also occur without any symptomatic genital herpes infection. A positive result from a PCR test of the cerebrospinal fluid confirms this diagnosis.

8f810a6f1464d6871d6184e04cf3fb1417983abc	The Allplex Respiratory Panel 1/2/3 (All16) is a multiplex PCR assay for detecting 16 respiratory viruses with influenza A virus (FluA) subtyping, and the first clinical assay based on multiple detection temperatures. We compared the results between All16 and Anyplex II RV16 (Any16) in 426 clinical samples. Samples showing discrepancies between the two tests were further tested using monoplex PCR. FluA subtyping based on the hemagglutinin type results of All16, which yielded H1, H3, and non-H1/H3, was compared with the results of the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel. The positive and negative percent agreements and kappa value for each virus between All16 and Any16 ranged from 54.5-100.0%, 84.7-100.0%, and 0.57-1.00, respectively. FluA subtype results from All16 for 26 samples were consistent with those from FilmArray. Good agreement was observed between the two methods, except when analyzing human enterovirus (kappa value 0.70), and the All16 showed reliable FluA subtyping results. For parainfluenza virus 3, the All16 was more sensitive than Any16. When testing 28 samples simultaneously, the mean test time and hands-on time were 4.3 and 0.5 hours, respectively in All16. In conclusion, All16 showed reliable performance, but further studies are needed regarding human enterovirus analysis.

7d568619357cdaea08773e7d5f19025c5abbaa3d	Enteric viral infections in pigs may cause diarrhea resulting in ill-thrift and substantial economic losses. This study reports the enteric infections with porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV4), porcine group A rotavirus (GARV), porcine group C rotavirus (GCRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine kobuvirus (PKoV) in 419 pigs, comprising both healthy and diarrheic animals, from 49 farms in five European countries (Austria, Germany, Hungary, Spain and Sweden). Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to test fecal samples and to compare the prevalence and viral load in relation to health status, farms of origin and age groups. The results showed that PAstV4 (70.4%) was the dominant virus species, followed by PKoV (56.7%), PCV2 (42.2%), GCRV (3%) and GARV (0.9%). Diarrheic pigs had a higher viral load of PAstV4 in the nursery and growing-finishing groups. Rotaviruses were mainly detected in diarrheic pigs, whereas PCV2 was more often detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheic pigs, suggesting that most PCV2 infections were subclinical. PAstV4, PCV2 and PKoV were considered ubiquitous in the European pig livestock and co-infections among them were frequent, independently of the disease status, in contrast to a low prevalence of classical rotavirus infections.
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	The aim of this review is to examine the causes, pathophysiology and experimental models of noninfectious pharyngitis (sore throat). Introduction The causes of sore throat can be infectious (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) or non-infectious, although the relative proportion of each is not well documented. Methods A PubMed database search was performed for studies of non-infectious sore throat. Results and conclusions Non-infectious causes of sore throat include: physico-chemical factors, such as smoking, snoring, shouting, tracheal intubation, medications, or concomitant illness; and environmental factors including indoor and outdoor air pollutants, temperature and humidity, and hazardous or occupational irritants. The pathophysiology underlying non-infectious sore throat is largely uncharacterised, although neurogenic inflammation looks to be a promising candidate. It is likely that there will be individual disposition factors or the coincidence of more than one irritant with possible-up to now unknown-interactions between them. Therefore, experimental models with defined conditions and objective endpoints are needed. A new model using cold dry air to directly induce pharyngeal irritation in humans, with pharyngeal lavage to measure biomarkers, may provide a useful tool for the study of mechanisms and treatment of non-infectious sore throat.

An ELISA for detection of antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) based on the specific solubility of the viral surface glycoprotein. Vet. Microbiol., 32:117-134. Viral proteins of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) were extracted from the cytoplasm of infected Vero cells using hypotonic conditions and a non-ionic detergent. Both the pH and the NaC1 concentration of the extraction buffer were varied in attempts to increase the solubility of the virion spike glycoproteins (S-protein) and of the nucleocapsid proteins (N-protein). Monoclonal antibodies, hyperimmune sera and convalescent pig sera were used to identify and monitor these proteins by immunoprecipitation and Western blots. The solubility of the S-protein was optimal at pH 4, whereas that of the N-protein was optimal at pH 9. Consequently, it was possible to enrich for either S-protein or N-protein; increases in the NaC! concentration of the buffer were of no advantage in this respect. Enriched preparations of the S-protein and N-protein were used as ELISA antigen for the S-ELISA and N-ELISA, respectively. The S-ELISA proved to be the more effective of the two immunoassays. Antibodies against S-protein remained detectable for longer periods of time than anti-N-protein antibodies in the sera of PEDV-infected pigs. Using this ELISA of increased sensitivity, it was observed that only a small number of farms in Switzerland had been infected with PEDV. Correspondence to: Prof. M.

7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	Acute exacerbations are significant events in the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Modern diagnostic techniques have revealed an infectious cause for the majority of exacerbations. Common respiratory viruses contribute to 25%-50% of exacerbations. Detection of viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples has become the preferred method to study viral exacerbations instead of viral cultures and serologic examination. Clinical application of such molecular detection requires additional studies to clarify interpretation of a positive result. Bacteria account for 25%-50% of exacerbations. Studies comparing molecular detection of bacteria in sputum with conventional culture techniques have shown that a substantial proportion of bacteria are not detected by the latter method. However, as with molecular viral detection, clinical application of molecular bacterial diagnosis requires additional studies. Although still faced with several challenges and requiring additional development, it is quite likely that molecular methods will become the preferred methods for determining the etiology of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
108ebac20ee26fd05a2ba7ad43523957c34d871e	The outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 resulted in unprecedented impacts on people's daily life. One of the most significant impacts to people is the fear of contacting the SARS virus while engaging daily routine activity. Here we use data from daily underground ridership in Taipei City and daily reported new SARS cases in Taiwan to model the dynamics of the public fear of the SARS virus during the wax and wane of the SARS period. We found that for each reported new SARS case there is an immediate loss of about 1200 underground ridership (the fresh fear). These daily loss rates dissipate to the following days with an e-folding time of about 28 days, reflecting the public perception on the risk of contacting SARS virus when traveling with the underground system (the residual fear). About 50% of daily ridership was lost during the peak of the 2003 SARS period, compared with the loss of 80% daily ridership during the closure of the underground system after Typhoon Nari, the loss of 50-70% ridership due to the closure of the governmental offices and schools during typhoon periods, and the loss of 60% daily ridership during Chinese New Year holidays.
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused multiple outbreaks. Such outbreaks increase economic and infection control burdens. We studied the infection control influence of MERS-CoV using a hospital-based analysis. Methods: Our hospital had 17 positive and 82 negative cases of MERS-CoV between April 1, 2013, and June 3, 2013. The study evaluated the impact of these cases on the use of gloves, surgical masks, N95 respirators, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and soap, as well as hand hygiene compliance rates. Results: During the study, the use of personal protective equipment during MERS-CoV compared with the period before MERS-CoV increased dramatically from 2,947.4 to 10,283.9 per 1,000 patient-days (P < .0000001) for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1,000 patient-days (P < .0000001) for N95 masks. The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer and soap showed a significant increase in utilized amount (P < .0000001). Hand hygiene compliance rates increased from 73% just before the occurrence of the first MERS case to 88% during MERS cases (P = .0001). The monthly added cost was $16,400 for included infection control items. Conclusions: There was a significant increase in the utilization of surgical masks, respirators, soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Such an increase is a challenge and adds cost to the healthcare system.
f531a49b32cb686067326ca6810070fee527dfe2	We present an original approach to sound program extraction in a proof assistant, using syntax-driven automation to derive correct-by-construction imperative programs from nondeterministic functional source code. Our approach does not require committing to a single inflexible compilation strategy and instead makes it straightforward to create domain-specific code translators. In addition to a small set of core definitions, our framework is a large, user-extensible collection of compilation rules each phrased to handle specific language constructs, code patterns, or data manipulations. By mixing and matching these pieces of logic, users can easily tailor extraction to their own domains and programs, getting maximum performance and ensuring correctness of the resulting assembly code. Using this approach, we complete the first proof-generating pipeline that goes automatically from high-level specifications to assembly code. In our main case study, the original specifications are phrased to resemble SQL-style queries, while the final assembly code does manual memory management, calls out to foreign data structures and functions, and is suitable to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. The pipeline runs entirely within the Coq proof assistant, leading to final, linked assembly code with overall full-functional-correctness proofs in separation logic.
d25f6fb47dd5eff8eb0caa73c0d7422f547a6544	Background: Infectious diseases that can cause epidemics, such as COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, constitute a major social issue, with healthcare providers fearing secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary infections. To alleviate this problem, telemedicine is increasingly being viewed as an effective means through which patients can be diagnosed and medications prescribed by doctors via untact Thus, concomitant with developments in information and communication technology (ICT), medical institutions have actively analyzed and applied ICT to medical systems to provide optimal medical services. However, with the convergence of these diverse technologies, various risks and security threats have emerged. To protect patients and improve telemedicine quality for patient safety, it is necessary to analyze these risks and security threats comprehensively and institute appropriate countermeasures. Methods: The security threats likely to be encountered in each of seven telemedicine service areas were analyzed, and related data were collected directly through on-site surveys by a medical institution. Subsequently, an attack tree, the most popular reliability and risk modeling approach for systematically characterizing the potential risks of telemedicine systems, was examined and utilized with the attack occurrence probability and attack success probability as variables to provide a comprehensive risk assessment method. Results: In this study, the most popular modelling method, an attack tree, was applied to the telemedicine environment, and the security concerns for telemedicine systems were found to be very large. Risk management and evaluation methods suitable for the telemedicine environment were identified, and their benefits and potential limitations were assessed. Conclusion: This research should be beneficial to security experts who wish to investigate the impacts of cybersecurity threats on remote healthcare and researchers who wish to identify new modeling opportunities to apply security risk modeling techniques.
94156e6941fe78191b5997cdeb10cb3fd06e1221	Background: Acute viral necrosis virus (AVNV) is the causative agent of a serious disease resulting in high mortality in cultured Chinese scallops, Chlamys farreri. We have sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of AVNV. Results: The AVNV genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule of 210,993 bp with a nucleotide composition of 38.5% G + C. A total of 123 open reading frames were predicted to encode functional proteins, ranging from 41 to 1,878 amino acid residues. The DNA sequence of AVNV is 97% identical to that of ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), and the amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins of these two viruses are 94-100% identical. The genomic organization of AVNV is similar to that of OsHV-1, and consists of two unique regions (170.4 kb and 3.4 kb, respectively), each flanked by two inverted repeats (7.6 kb and 10.2 kb, respectively), with a third unique region (1.5 kb) situated between the two internal repeats. Conclusions: Our results indicate that AVNV is a variant of OsHV-1. The AVNV genome sequence provides information useful for understanding the evolution and divergence of OsHV-1 in marine molluscs.
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) membrane (M) proteins are capable of self-assembly and release in the form of membrane-enveloped vesicles, and of forming virus-like particles (VLPs) when coexpressed with SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein. According to previous deletion analyses, M self-assembly involves multiple M sequence regions. To identify important M amino acid residues for VLP assembly, we coexpressed N with multiple M mutants containing substitution mutations at the amino-terminal ectodomain, carboxyl-terminal endodomain, or transmembrane segments. Our results indicate that a dileucine motif in the endodomain tail (218LL219) is required for efficient N packaging into VLPs. Results from cross-linking VLP analyses suggest that the cysteine residues 63, 85 and 158 are not in close proximity to the M dimer interface. We noted a significant reduction in M secretion due to serine replacement for C158, but not for C63 or C85. Further analysis suggests that C158 is involved in M-N interaction. In addition to mutations of the highly conserved 107-SWWSFNPE-114 motif, substitutions at codons W19, W57, P58, W91, Y94 or F95 all resulted in significantly reduced VLP yields, largely due to defective M secretion. VLP production was not significantly affected by a tryptophan replacement of Y94 or F95 or a phenylalanine replacement of W19, W57 or W91. Combined, these results indicate the involvement of specific M amino acids during SARS-CoV virus assembly, and suggest that aromatic residue retention at specific positions is critical for M function in terms of directing virus assembly.

3b8825a2e0ba332163fe59bd9c4a566bb258ac96	Using a sensitive research-grade infrared camera, we find that common facial cosmetics and lotions mask skin temperature in assays of the human forehead. We test a family of 10 commonly-used cosmetic products and find that volatile liquids and creams lower thermal skin temperature by at least 2 C for up to 5-10 min and at least 1 C for up to 20 min, respectively. Powder and cream that contains brightening agent lower indefinitely the skin temperature sensed by infrared camera. With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable.
5293e30df1fc4d36116f26339c3de8b012d465dd	Despite all the scientific and technological developments in the past one hundred years, biologic issues such as pandemics are a constant threat to society. While one of the aspects of a pandemic is the loss of human life, the outbreak has multi-dimensional impacts across regional and global societies. In this paper, a comparative regressive and neural network model is developed to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) on the electricity and petroleum demand in China. The environmental analysis shows that the epidemic severeness significantly affects the electricity and the petroleum demand, both directly and indirectly. The outputs of the model stated that the elasticity of petroleum and electricity demand toward the population of the infected people is −0.1% and −0.65%, respectively. The mentioned results show that pandemic status has a significant impact on energy demand, and also its impacts can be tracked into every corner of human society.
8b90904ece479c8519269255a21da469ba8ed281	The United Kingdom was assessed as a low risk country throughout the 2003 global SARS outbreaks. Despite this, 368 reports of potential SARS cases were made to the Health Protection Agency (HPA) between March and July 2003. The public health actions undertaken in response to these reports, the establishment of reporting mechanisms and the development of guidance documents were substantial. Lessons learned from mounting a UK response to SARS included: the importance of international collaboration; formation of a UK-wide, multidisciplinary Task Force; flexible case reporting mechanisms; integration of surveillance and laboratory data; generation of prompt and web-accessible guidance and advice; availability of surge capacity; and contingency planning. Lessons learned are being incorporated into the HPA's preparedness to prevent and control future newly emerging infectious disease threats. Q
eb857510ea5f5fe08939367ae2da82aaf2ba92bb	Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease, caused by the member of the Togaviridae family belongs to the genus alphavirus, making it a major threat in all developing countries as well as some developed countries. The mosquito acts as a vector for the disease and carries the CHIK-Virus. To date there is no direct treatment available and that demands the development of more effective vaccines. In this study author employed Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource, a machine learningbased algorithm principally working on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, also known as (IEDB-ANN) for the prediction and analysis of Epitopes. A total of 173 epitopes were identified on the basis of IC50 values, among them 40 epitopes were found, sharing part with the linear B-cell epitopes and exposed to the cTAP1protein, and out of 40, 6 epitopes were noticed to show interactions with the cTAP with their binding energy ranging from − 3.61 to − 1.22 kcal/mol. The six epitopes identified were exposed to the HLA class I alleles and from this all revealed interaction with the HLA alleles and minimum binding energy that ranges from − 4.12 to − 5.88 kcal/mol. Besides, two T cell epitopes i.e. 145 KVFTGVYPE 153 and 395 STVPVAPPR 403 were found most promiscuous candidates. These promiscuous epitopes-HLA complexes were further analyzed by the molecular dynamics simulation to check the stability of the complex. Results obtained from this study suggest that the identified epitopes i.e. and 395 STVPVAPPR 403 , are likely to be capable of passing through the lumen of ER to bind withthe HLA class I allele and provide new insights and potential application in the designing and development of peptide-based vaccine candidate for the treatment of chikungunya.

b2bedd9406f6529cc4b36b446f8913d3df4c5e91	A number of effective models have been developed for simulating chemical transport in porous media; however, when a reactive chemical problem comprises multiple species within a substantial domain for a long period of time, the computational cost can become prohibitively expensive. This issue is addressed here by proposing a new numerical procedure to reduce the number of transport equations to be solved. This new problem reduction scheme (PRS) uses a predictor-corrector approach, which "predicts" the transport of a set of non-indicator species using results from a set of indicator species before "correcting" the non-indicator concentrations using a mass balance error measure. The full chemical transport model is described along with experimental validation. The PRS is then presented together with an investigation, based on a 16-species reaction-advection-diffusion problem, which determines the range of applicability of different orders of the PRS. The results of a further study are presented, in which a set of PRS simulations is compared with those from full model predictions. The application of the scheme to the intermediate-sized problems considered in the present study showed reductions of up to 82% in CPU time, with good levels of accuracy maintained.
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	Introduction: In many centers, children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) receive care either in an endocrinology ward or a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We conducted a quality improvement (QI) initiative to reduce potentially avoidable PICU admissions of children with DKA without increasing endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers. Methods: A survey of providers demonstrated opportunities to increase awareness of institutional criteria for PICU admissions of children with DKA. We created an electronic health record (EHR) dot-phrase, prepopulated with these criteria, and placed a note in the EHR for all patients with DKA as a reference for all providers. An EHR-based data report was created to monitor the disposition of DKA patients and the use of the dot-phrase (process measure). The primary outcome measure was the potentially avoidable PICU admissions for patients with DKA. Endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers were tracked as a balancing measure to ensure safe disposition. Results: After the implementation of the dot-phrase, use was variable, but averaged 33.4% over 1 year. The percentage of DKA admissions classified as potentially avoidable PICU stays decreased from 4.1% to 0.5%, with a concurrent decrease in the total percentage of PICU admissions for DKA from 19.1% to 8.4%. The percentage of endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers also declined from 0.8% to 0%. Conclusions: A novel EHR-based intervention increasing awareness and documentation of established pediatric DKA management guidelines can be used to safely reduce PICU admissions for DKA without increasing the rate of endocrinology ward-to-intensive care unit transfers.

d513f15e32bef1b241085c514a4aa41923e0475b	This article analyzes ways that logistical services add value to products over and above traditional utility tradeoffs as a result of a confluence of aesthetic, economic, and cultural facets that we identify as enchantment. We delve into how enchantment might be digitally articulated through mediated (as opposed to brick and mortar) consumption, paying attention to the cultural techniques and affordances of the platforms and spaces. Through a series of case studies, we examine ways in which enchantment can occur in digitally mediated shopping environments. Our case studies suggest that enchanted digital logistical channels extend the value-creating functions of traditional logistics by creating consumption circumstances that surprise and intrigue, that suggest perceived scarcity, and that use social media to approach consumers in multiple ways to procure enchantment.
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	Two notable features have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (1) the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2; (2) a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids (PRRA) at the S1 and S2 boundary. For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution. The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.

Anti-CHIKV Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer (CPMO) was evaluated for its antiviral efficacy and cytotoxcity in human cells and neonate murine model. Two CPMOs were designed to block translation initiation of a highly conserved sequence in CHIKV non-structural and structural polyprotein, respectively. Pre-treatment of HeLa cells with CPMO1 signficantly suppressed CHIKV titre, CHIKV E2 protein expression and prevented CHIKV-induced CPE. CPMO1 activity was also CHIKV-specific as shown by the lack of cross-reactivity against SINV or DENV replication. When administered prophylactically in neonate mice, 15 μg/g CPMO1v conferred 100% survival against CHIKV disease. In parallel, these mice demonstrated significant reduction in viremia and viral load in various tissues. Immunohistological examination of skeletal muscles and liver of CPMO1vtreated mice also showed healthy tissue morphology, in contrast to evident manifestation of CHIKV pathogenesis in PBS-or scrambled sCPMO1v-treated groups. Taken together, our findings highlight for the first time that CPMO1v has strong protective effect against CHIKV infection. This warrants future development of morpholino as an alternative antiviral agent to address CHIKV infection in clinical applications.
46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	Application of autologous serum eye drops (SEDs) is a recognized means to treat severe dry-eye syndrome (DES). Due to the inconvenience and difficulty of preparing SEDs from some patients, producing SEDs from allogeneic blood donations is gaining popularity. A major safety concern associated with allogeneic blood is virus transmission. We therefore herein evaluated the possibility of applying a solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment to inactivate viruses and studied the impacts of such treatment of SEDs to resolve DES in a rabbit model. Sera prepared from the blood of five rabbits were pooled and divided into two subpools. One was untreated (SEDs), while the other was virally-inactivated with 1% Tri-n-butyl phosphate/1% Triton X-45 at 31°C for 1 h (S/D-SEDs). DES was induced in rabbits using 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Rabbits were divided into five groups of two rabbits each. One group was untreated (control), three were treated twice daily for 3 weeks using PBS, SEDs, or S/D-SEDs, and the last received an additional 0.1% BAC (as the negative control). The DES condition was determined by measuring aqueous tear secretion (Schirmer's test), corneal fluorescein staining, a corneal histologic examination, TUNEL stain apoptosis, and corneal inflammatory marker (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and IL-6) expressions. We first confirmed that SEDs and S/D-SEDs had similar protein profiles and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β contents. Animal experiments showed that tear secretion did not significantly differ between the SED and S/D-SED groups but was significantly higher than in the PBS group. Eye fluorescein staining revealed dramatic improvements in epithelial defects in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs, and hematoxylin/ eosin staining revealed microscopic epithelial layers similar to those of the untreated controls. Inflammatory markers and TUNEL studies showed that healthy epithelium had been restored in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs. In conclusion, this preclinical study supports the possibility of using S/D virally inactivated SEDs to treat DES and restore a normal epithelium. 3 / 14 different treatments. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (error bars). * p<0.05 versus control group; # p<0.05 versus DES; % p<0.05 versus PBS; @ p<0.05 versus SED (One way ANOVA-Tukey's multiple comparisons).
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	Background: Dengue and malaria are two common, mosquito-borne infections, which may lead to mortality if not managed properly. Concurrent infections of dengue and malaria are rare due to the different habitats of its vectors and activities of different carrier mosquitoes. The first case reported was in 2005. Since then, several concurrent infections have been reported between the dengue virus (DENV) and the malaria protozoans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Symptoms of each infection may be masked by a simultaneous second infection, resulting in late treatment and severe complications. Plasmodium knowlesi is also a common cause of malaria in Malaysia with one of the highest rates of mortality. This report is one of the earliest in literature of concomitant infection between DENV and P. knowlesi in which a delay in diagnosis had placed a patient in a life-threatening situation. Case presentation: A 59-year old man staying near the Belum-Temengor rainforest at the Malaysia-Thailand border was admitted with fever for 6 days, with respiratory distress. His non-structural protein 1 antigen and Anti-DENV Immunoglobulin M tests were positive. He was treated for severe dengue with compensated shock. Treating the dengue had so distracted the clinicians that a blood film for the malaria parasite was not done. Despite aggressive supportive treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient had unresolved acidosis as well as multi-organ failure involving respiratory, renal, liver, and haematological systems. It was due to the presentation of shivering in the ICU, that a blood film was done on the second day that revealed the presence of P. knowlesi with a parasite count of 520,000/μL. The patient was subsequently treated with artesunate-doxycycline and made a good recovery after nine days in ICU. This case contributes to the body of literature on co-infection between DENV and P. knowlesi and highlights the clinical consequences, which can be severe. Awareness should be raised among health-care workers on the possibility of dengue-malaria co-infection in this region. Further research is required to determine the real incidence and risk of co-infection in order to improve the management of acute febrile illness.
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	The pulmonary vasculature is an anatomic compartment that is frequently overlooked in the histologic review of lung biopsy samples, other than those obtained specifically to assess pulmonary vascular disease. 1 Though often of a nonspecific nature, the histologic pattern of vascular remodeling may at times suggest its underlying pathogenesis and provide clues to the cause of pulmonary hypertension. 2 Disproportionately severe vascular pathology may further indicate alternate disease processes, such as congestive heart failure or thromboemboli, contributing to the patient's overall respiratory condition. This chapter discusses pulmonary hypertension, which represents a final common pathway of pulmonary vascular disease. 3 Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (i.e., primary pulmonary hypertension) serves as a model of vascular reconfiguration formerly designated as "plexogenic arteriopathy.,,4 The 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of pulmonary hypertension, however, has shifted the primary emphasis from the plexiform lesion (now considered a generic marker of severe pulmonary hypertension) toward an integrated construct that incorporates clinical history, epidemiology, and morphology in the classification schema. s Other major categories of pulmonary hypertension, including thromboembolic, hypoxic, and pulmonary venous hypertension, are each considered in separate sections that focus on morphologic patterns of recognition and the important underlying conditions that contribute to each category. The broad and complex topic of pulmonary vasculitis is discussed in Chapter 29, which serves as a companion chapter to this chapter. It is, admittedly, artificial to segregate pulmonary vascular pathology in one or two isolated chapters since blood vessels are involved either primarily or secondarily across the vast spectrum of lung pathology. The reader is therefore liberally referred to other areas of the text where vascular pathology is considered in the context of parenchymal or airway diseases. For example, the 1032
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	Background: In response to the novel influenza A H1N1 outbreak in the NY City area, 6090 patient samples were submitted over a 5-week period for a total of 14,114 viral diagnostic tests, including rapid antigen, direct immunofluorescence (DFA), viral culture and PCR. Little was known about the performance of the assays for the detection of novel H1N1 in the background of seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and other circulating respiratory viruses. In addition, subtyping influenza A became critical for the identification of high risk and/or hospitalized patients with novel H1N1 infection and for monitoring the spread of the outbreak. Study design: This study analyzed the performances of the BinaxNOW Influenza A&B test (BinaxNOW), the 3M Rapid Detection Flu A + B test (3MA + B), direct immunofluorescence, R-Mix culture and the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) for the detection of seasonal influenza, novel H1N1 and other respiratory viruses. RVP was also evaluated for its ability to differentiate seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and novel H1N1. Results: The sensitivities, specificities, PPVs and NPVs for the detection of novel H1N1, determined by comparing all four-test methods, were: rapid antigen: 17.8%, 93.6%, 77.4%, 47.9%; DFA: 46.7%, 94.5%, 91.3%, 58.9%; R-Mix culture: 88.9%, 100%, 100%, 87.9%; RVP: 97.8%, 100%, 100%, 97.3%. The individual sensitivities of BinaxNOW and 3MA + B as compared to R-Mix culture for the detection of novel H1N1 were 9.6% and 40%, respectively. All unsubtypeable influenza A specimens identified by RVP and tested with the CDC novel H1N1 specific RT-PCR assay were confirmed to be novel H1N1. Conclusions: Rapid antigen tests, DFA, R-Mix culture and the xTAG RVP test all detected the novel H1N1 strain, but with highly varied sensitivity. The RVP test provided the best diagnostic option as RVP demonstrated superior sensitivity for the detection of all influenza strains, including the novel H1N1, provided accurate influenza A subtyping and identified a significant number of additional respiratory pathogens.
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	Intranasally administered live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines provide significant protection against heterologous influenza A virus (IAV) challenge. However, LAIV administration can modify the bacterial microbiota in the upper respiratory tract, including alterations in species that cause pneumonia. We sought to evaluate the effect of Bordetella bronchiseptica colonization on LAIV immunogenicity and efficacy in swine, and the impact of LAIV and IAV challenge on B. bronchiseptica colonization and disease. LAIV immunogenicity was not significantly impacted by B. bronchiseptica colonization, but protective efficacy against heterologous IAV challenge in the upper respiratory tract was impaired. Titers of IAV in the nose and trachea of pigs that received LAIV were significantly reduced when compared to non-vaccinated, challenged controls, regardless of B. bronchiseptica infection. Pneumonia scores were higher in pigs colonized with B. bronchiseptica and challenged with IAV, but this was regardless of LAIV vaccination status. While LAIV vaccination provided significant protection against heterologous IAV challenge, the protection was not sterilizing and IAV replicated in the respiratory tract of all LAIV vaccinated pig. The interaction between IAV, B. bronchiseptica, and host led to development of acute-type B. bronchiseptica lesions in the lung. Thus, the data presented do not negate the efficacy of LAIV vaccination, but instead indicate that controlling B. bronchiseptica colonization in swine could limit the negative interaction between IAV and Bordetella on swine health.
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	Feces from 142 animals were collected on 15 farms in the region of Brittany, France. Each sample was directly collected from the rectum of the animal and identified with the ear tag number. Animals were sampled three times, at 5, 15 and 22 weeks of age. After DNA extraction from stool samples, nested PCR was performed to amplify partial 18S-rDNA and 60 kDa glycoprotein genes of Cryptosporidium. The parasite was detected on all farms. One hundred out of 142 calves (70.4%) were found to be parasitized by Cryptosporidium. Amplified fragments were sequenced for Cryptosporidium species identification and revealed the presence of C. parvum (43.8%), C. ryanae (28.5%), and C. bovis (27%). One animal was infected with Cryptosporidium ubiquitum. The prevalence of these species was related to the age of the animal. C. parvum caused 86.7% of Cryptosporidium infections in 5-week-old calves but only 1.7% in 15-week-old animals. The analysis of the results showed that animals could be infected successively by C. parvum, C. ryanae, and C. bovis for the study period. C. parvum gp60 genotyping identifies 6 IIa subtypes of which 74.5% were represented by IIaA15G2R1. This work confirms previous studies in other countries showing that zoonotic C. parvum is the dominant species seen in young calves.
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	Ebola virus is a severe, frequently fatal illness, with a case fatality rate up to 90%. The outbreak of the disease has been acknowledged by World Health Organization as Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The threat of Ebola in West Africa is still a major setback to the socioeconomic development. Optimal control theory is applied to a system of ordinary differential equations which is modeling Ebola infection through three different routes including contact between humans and a dead body. In an attempt to reduce infection in susceptible population, a preventive control is put in the form of education and campaign and two treatment controls are applied to infected and late-stage infected (super) human population. The Pontryagins maximum principle is employed to characterize optimality control, which is then solved numerically. It is observed that time optimal control is existed in the model. The activation of each control showed a positive reduction of infection. The overall effect of activation of all the controls simultaneously reduced the effort required for the reduction of the infection quickly. The obtained results present a good framework for planning and designing cost-effective strategies for good interventions in dealing with Ebola disease. It is established that in order to reduce Ebola threat all the three controls must be taken into consideration concurrently.
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	Background The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and the subsequent emergence of the H5N1 virus have highlighted the threat of a global pandemic influenza outbreak. Planning effective public health control measures for such a case will be highly dependent on sound theory-based research on how people perceive the risks involved in such an event. Purpose The present article aims to review theoretical models and concepts underlying current empirical research on pandemic influenza risk perception. Method A review was conducted based on 28 empirical studies from 30 articles which were published between 2003 and 2007. Results Concepts of risk perception mostly seemed more pragmatic than theory-based and were highly heterogeneous, for instance, in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components. Similarly, the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model-based. Conclusions The current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights. Unlike the reviewed studies, which were mostly launched as a rapid response to outbreak situations, future research will have to invest more strongly into theoretical work to provide sounder evidence.
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	In today's social network age, information flowing in networks does not derive solely from external sources; people in the network also independently generate signals. These self-generated signals may not be deliberate lies, but they may not bear any relationship with the truth, either. Following the philosopher Harry G. Frankfurt, we refer to such self-generated signals as bullshit. We present an information diffusion model that allows nodes which hold no value to spread information, capturing the diffusion of bullshit information. The presence of self-generated signals (i.e., bullshit) increases the amount of information available for transmission in the network. However, participants in the spread process respond to the existence of such self-generated information by receiving data from internal sources with caution. These two contradictory forces-the increase in information transmission on the one hand, and in suspicion on the other-result in a two-sided effect of bullshit on the total spread time. We first take a numerical approach, simulating our model on Watts-Strogatz networks and building a decision tree to characterize the effects of bullshit given different network structures. We find that increasing the rate of self-generated information may have either a monotonic or non-monotonic effect on the rumor spread time, depending on the network structure and rate of non-self-generated internal communications. Then, taking an analytical approach, we analyze the spread behavior for cliques, and identify the conditions for monotonic behavior in a 2-clique network.
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	Immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk for complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, comprehensive data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are still lacking. We performed a multicenter nationwide observational study within the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) to describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes of the first microbiologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection among SOT recipients. Overall, 21 patients were included with a median age of 56 years (10 kidney, 5 liver, 1 pancreas, 1 lung, 1 heart and 3 combined transplantations). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (76%), dry cough (57%), nausea (33%) and diarrhea (33%). Ninety-five percent and 24% of patients required hospital and ICU admission, respectively, and 19% were intubated. After a median of 33 days of follow-up, 16 patients were discharged, 3 were still hospitalized and 2 patients died. These data suggest that clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in middle-aged SOT recipients appear to be similar to the general population without an apparent higher rate of complications. These results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts.
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	Purpose of Review Despite advances in diagnostic microbiology and sepsis management, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Current recommendations regarding the use of beta-lactams in combination with macrolides published in clinical practice guidelines are variable and based on low-quality evidence that is frequently retrospective, observational, and heterogeneous in nature. While population-based studies have historically suggested improved clinical outcomes with the routine use of macrolide combination therapy in hospitalized patients with CAP, emerging evidence from recent randomized controlled trials has challenged this practice. In this article, we discuss the historical rationale and current evidence for combination macrolide therapy in the management of CAP. Recent Findings Recent randomized controlled trials have assessed the non-inferiority of beta-lactam monotherapy compared to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy in adult patients hospitalized with CAP. Beta-lactam monotherapy was associated with equivalent clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate CAP. Patients with severe CAP managed with beta-lactam monotherapy have demonstrated worse clinical outcomes when compared to patients treated with combination therapy. In addition, previous beta-lactam exposure prior to hospitalization has not been shown to negatively impact outcomes in patients managed with beta-lactam monotherapy in the hospital. Summary Current evidence supports the use of beta-lactam monotherapy in adult patients hospitalized with mild to moderate CAP. While existing evidence supports the use of combination therapy in patients with severe pneumonia, further large-scale randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to clarify the role of combination therapy in this population.
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	Background: In mid-June 2009 the State of Victoria in Australia appeared to have the highest notification rate of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in the world. We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. Results: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA.
44ba95a4dab84a70d13fc790ccaf2c6a2646cf62	Aim In view of the spread of the contagious coronavirus disease globally, the present review focuses on the details of past pandemic diseases, along with comparisons and lessons learned. A general awareness of COVID-19 infection is addressed, and it is compared with the Spanish flu pandemic. Based on the successes, failures and lessons learned in the past, governmental efforts must be undertaken to empower citizens by providing accurate information and implementing post-COVID-19 precautions that need to be taken now to stop the spread and recurrence of the virus locally, and to restore health and economic normalcy. Methods A detailed literature survey of past pandemics is undertaken in order to extract the successes, failures and lessons learned from previous breakouts. The comparison of past pandemics will enable us to determine post-COVID-19 precautions that should be followed. Separate tables are prepared to highlight the lessons learned and measures to be taken. Both general precautions and preventive measures for pregnant women are compiled. Results The literature shows a continuous struggle of humans with disease outbreaks, with the most adverse impact of the Spanish flu killing 20-50 million people. Precautions need to be taken including social distancing, compulsory mask-wearing, avoiding public gatherings and washing hands regularly. The lessons from earlier pandemics show that they were equally devastating, and vaccines were not available at the time of outbreaks. Vaccines developed for polio, H1N1, measles, and other viral diseases have proven to save countless lives. Living with COVID-19 and evolving the work culture of protecting oneself and protecting others also has to be adopted. Conclusions COVID-19 has become an everyday topic of discussion throughout the world, indicating the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries. The lessons learned from past pandemics such as social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding public gatherings and adherence to guidelines, along with personal hygiene, are the key measures that must be taken in order to live with COVID-19. Precautions for the elderly and pregnant women advised by medical authorities are to be strictly adhered to. These will help in reducing COVID-19 cases and in turn will reduce the pressure on hospitals to serve those in need. India has learned lessons from the past and the present pandemic and will move towards growth through its self-reliance.
a4b18c43ab760a5fdbcf37d820b8144f94e760b3	Background: COCOA, a contact reporting application in Japan, was launched at the end of June 2020. Object: We assessed effectiveness of COCOA. Method: After developing a simple susceptible-infected-recovery model with COCOA and voluntary restrictions against going out (VRG), we assumed that COCOA can reduce infectiousness by 10-50% points through self-quarantine at home after receiving notification from COCOA. Results: COCOA alone is insufficient to halt an outbreak. Even if the entire population were to use COCOA, the reproduction number would be 1.31. However, if VRG were 15%, about half of the maximum VRG effectiveness under the emergency state declaration, then 10% COCOA use by a population can reduce the reproduction number to less than one. Conclusion: Significant effects of COCOA for reducing the reproduction number were found. However, without VRG, COCOA alone is insufficient to control an outbreak.
f0da6f2b19b1696e9cf4e5f4c4aa9beb3a41eeaa	Psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic is not solely limited to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It may also be related to social, cultural, and environmental factors, which may act as additional stressors. The aim of the current study was to explore the association between psychological distress and subjective overload among dentists in different countries, and whether it is associated with COVID-19-related factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1302 dentists from China, India, Israel, Italy, and the UK, who filled out demographics data, COVID-19-related factor questions, subjective overload, and psychological distress scales. Our findings showed that the positive association between subjective overload and psychological distress was different among countries, suggesting higher rate of intensity in Italy compared to China, India, and Israel (the UK was near significance with China and Israel). The interaction variable of the subjective overload × psychological distress was significantly associated with a particular country, with those individuals reporting fear of contracting COVID-19 from patients, fear of their families contracting COVID-19, and receiving enough professional knowledge regarding COVID-19. Given the above, dentists were found to have elevated levels of subjective overload and psychological distress, which differed among the countries, presumably due to certain background issues such as social, cultural, and environmental factors.
9055c2a1c584b084a9339c4919b59c7a26245182	National evidence-based guidelines for preventing healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England were originally commissioned by the Department of Health and developed during 1998-2000 by a nurse-led multi-professional team of researchers and specialist clinicians. Following extensive consultation, they were À rst published in January 2001 1 and updated in 2007. 2 A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identiÀ ed, appraised and, if shown to be effective for the prevention of HCAI, incorporated into amended guidelines. Periodically updating the evidence base and guideline recommendations is essential in order to maintain their validity and authority. The Department of Health commissioned a review of new evidence and we have updated the evidence base for making infection prevention and control recommendations. A critical assessment of the updated evidence indicated that the epic2 guidelines published in 2007 remain robust, relevant and appropriate, but some guideline recommendations required adjustments to enhance clarity and a number of new recommendations were required. These have been clearly identiÀ ed in the text. In addition, the synopses of evidence underpinning the guideline recommendations have been updated. These guidelines (epic3) provide comprehensive recommendations for preventing HCAI in hospital and other acute care settings based on the best currently available evidence. National evidence-based guidelines are broad principles of best practice that need to be integrated into local practice guidelines and audited to reduce variation in practice and maintain patient safety. Clinically effective infection prevention and control practice is an essential feature of patient protection. By incorporating these guidelines into routine daily clinical practice, patient safety can be enhanced and the risk of patients acquiring an infection during episodes of health care in NHS hospitals in England can be minimised.

We reviewed the chest CT scans, laboratory findings, and clinical records of 66 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to affiliated hospitals of Nanchang university, Nanchang, China, from Jan 21 to Feb 2, 2020. CT was used to evaluate the radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Only 4 patients (4/66, 6%) claimed their exposure to COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The major symptoms were fever (60/66, 91%) and cough (37/66, 56%). The predominant features of lesion were scattered (43/66, 65%), bilateral (50/66, 76%), groundglass opacity (64/66, 97%), and air bronchogram sign (47/66, 71%). Forty-eight patients (48/66, 73%) had more than two lobes involved. Right lower lobe (58/66, 88%) and left lower lobe (49/66, 74%) were most likely invaded. Twelve patients (12/66, 18%) had at least one comorbid condition. Pleural traction (29/66, 44%), crazy paving (15/66, 23%), interlobular septal thickening (11/66, 17%), and consolidation (7/66, 11%) were also observed. The typical radiology features of COVID-19 patients are scattered ground-glass opacity in the bilateral lobes. Fever and cough are the major symptoms. Evaluating chest CT, clinical symptoms, and laboratory results could facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19, and judge disease progression.
5326626cf66eb61f7f001c6557c23058b57fb2e2	Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) sometimes causes acute and severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. RSV strongly upregulates proinflammatory cytokines and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Clarithromycin (CAM), which is an antimicrobial agent and is also known as an immunomodulator, significantly suppressed RSV-induced production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). CAM also suppressed RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and adhesion of fluorescein-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells. The RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion was thought to be mediated by the host cell's PAF receptor. CAM, which exhibits antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found in this study to suppress the RSV-induced adhesion of respiratory disease-causing bacteria, S. pneumoniae, to host cells. Thus, CAM might suppress immunological disorders and prevent secondary bacterial infections during RSV infection.
a193ba314e99e7b3e16cfe2e6de271e004f4ef64	Background Frailty and multimorbidity have been suggested as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Aims We investigated, in the UK Biobank, whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19. Results 4510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive = 1326, negative = 3184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.4 [95%CI = 1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (≥ 4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR = 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. However, frailty and multimorbidity were not
0953fa36903063f60627e07f7b4e07f0aec3c4d3	The role of type I IFNs in protecting against coronavirus (CoV) infections is not fully understood. While CoVs are poor inducers of type I IFNs in tissue culture, several studies have demonstrated the importance of the type I IFN response in controlling MHV infection in animals. The protective effectors against MHV infection are, however, still unknown. In order to get more insight into the antiviral gene expression induced in the brains of MHVinfected mice, we performed whole-genome expression profiling. Three different mouse strains, differing in their susceptibility to infection with MHV, were used. In BALB/c mice, which display high viral loads but are able to control the infection, 57 and 121 genes were significantly differentially expressed (≥ 1.5 fold change) upon infection at 2 and 5 days post infection, respectively. Functional association network analyses demonstrated a strong type I IFN response, with Irf1 and Irf7 as the central players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent. Both the type I and II IFN response, which were more pronounced in mice with a higher viral load, were not observed in 129SvEv mice, which are much less susceptible to infection with MHV. 129SvEv mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-/-), however, were not able to control the infection. Gene expression profiling of these mice identified type I IFN-independent responses to infection, with IFN-γ as the central player. As the BALB/c and the IFNAR-/-129SvEv mice demonstrated very similar viral loads in their brains, we also compared their gene expression profiles upon infection with MHV in order to identify type I IFN-dependent transcriptional responses. Many known IFN-inducible genes were detected, several of which have previously been shown to play an important protective role against virus infections. We speculate that the additional type I IFNdependent genes that we discovered may also be important for protection against MHV infection. Transcriptional profiling of mice infected with MHV demonstrated the induction of a robust IFN response, which correlated with the viral load. Profiling of IFNAR-/-mice allowed us to identify type I IFN-independent and -dependent responses. Overall, this study broadens our present knowledge of the type I and II IFN-mediated effector responses during CoV infection in vivo.
2a13d7555c9b704a6603a715c112229dbf03a2e8	The study of the microbiome data holds great potential for elucidating the biological and metabolic functioning of living organisms and their role in the environment. Metagenomic analyses have shown that humans, along with e.g. domestic animals, wildlife and arthropods, are colonized by an immense community of viruses. The current Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) heightens the need to rapidly detect previously unknown viruses in an unbiased way. The increasing availability of metagenomic data in this era of next-generation sequencing (NGS), along with increasingly affordable sequencing technologies, highlight the need for reliable and comprehensive methods to manage such data. In this article, we present a novel stand-alone pipeline called LAZYPIPE for identifying both previously known and novel viruses in host-associated or environmental samples and give examples of virus discovery based on it. LAZYPIPE is a Unix-based pipeline for automated assembling and taxonomic profiling of NGS libraries implemented as a collection of C++, Perl, and R scripts.
d7a49425f5b0bc54e01e3ae7193da5a487fdc65f	Background COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Predictors for severe COVID-19 infection have not been well defined. Determination of risk factors for severe infection would enable identifying patients who may benefit from aggressive supportive care and early intervention. We conducted a retrospective observational study of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic medical center. Of 197 hospitalized patients, the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 60.6 (16.2) years, 103 (52.3%) were male and 156 (82.1%) were black. Severe COVID-19 infection was noted in 74 (37.6%) patients, requiring intubation. Patients aged above 60 were significantly more likely to have severe infection. Patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease and had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to patients with non-severe infection. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for severe infection included pre-existing renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% CI 2.5-22.0), oxygen requirement at hospitalization (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.7), acute renal injury (OR, 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.6) and initial CRP (OR,1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.01). Race, age and socioeconomic status were not identified as independent predictors. A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 Acute or pre-existing renal disease, supplemental oxygen at the time of hospitalization and initial CRP were independent predictors for the development of severe COVID-19 infections. Every 1 unit increase in CRP increased the risk of severe disease by 0.06%.
aec327cb3209a508e1cbed0394ca27376cb11352	Keywords: Health-care facilities Hospital preparedness Emerging infectious disease Pandemic planning a b s t r a c t Background: The emergence of many infectious diseases has been of serious public health implication in the 21st century. Hospital preparedness is a key step in strengthening a country's ability to address any public health emergency of international concern caused by these diseases. In India, because 80% of the health-care utilization happens in the private hospitals, it is of at most importance to assess the preparedness level of these hospitals against emerging infectious diseases. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional study, and hospitals which provided consent were included. The estimated participants for the study were 54. Results: The results were expressed in a descriptive manner. For the purpose of analysis, the questionnaire was redistributed based on the monitoring and evaluation framework of International Health Regulations and its core capacities. It was found that there was a need to enhance the preparedness of the hospitals in the response against emerging infectious diseases. There were gaps in the implementation of various plans and protocols for staff training, risk communication, surge capacity, laboratory capacity, and infection control in the hospitals. Conclusion: The findings were suggestive of a need for preparedness of the hospitals against the upsurge of emerging infectious diseases.

It was shown previously that if we can find an L such that (R, B, L) forms a Hadamard triple, then the associated fractal self-affine measure generated by (R, B) admits an exponential orthonormal basis of certain frequency set Λ, and hence it is termed as a spectral measure. In this paper, we show that if #B < | det(R)|, not only it is spectral, we can also construct arbitrarily sparse spectrum Λ in the sense that its Beurling dimension is zero.

6264cb1fdbd7370e4b21e35a02bbb49d4d4c1ddd	The ICH S6R1 and S8 guidelines define a general framework for the immunotoxicity evaluation of biotechnologyderived pharmaceuticals and human pharmaceuticals, respectively. As severe and unpredicted adverse events dramatically showed in the recent years that the immune system is a critical aspect of drug safety, this framework needs to be revisited to enhance the prediction of nonclinical immune safety evaluation. Safety immunopharmacology is deemed to contribute to this awaited improvement by enabling early screening of the potential for drug candidates to induce unexpected immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects as well as nonimmune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Dedicated safety immunopharmacology can also generate mechanistic data to determine which relevant additional immunotoxicity studies should be conducted. Immunological assays and models that can be considered for use in the context of safety pharmacology studies are presented as well as perspectives for their timely development.
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	The Chinese government began implementing extensive public health measures aimed at confronting COVID-19 during January 2020. These measures included contact tracing, disease surveillance, and enforced social distancing, as well as close monitoring of those infected and extensive quarantine and isolation measures. Authorities engaged in an unprecedented effort to cordon off Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. The measures adopted in China echoed and amplified approaches undertaken during recent outbreaks of SARS (2003) and MERS (2012). Although their intensity is unique, these measures are largely grounded in long-standing public health approaches to respiratory viruses. As COVID-19 has spread to other parts of the globe, other nations have adopted social distancing, quarantine, and isolation strategies. Here, we investigate how these measures have impacted COVID-19's time-varying reproduction number at the national level and globally. R(t) We use a branching point process [1] to estimate a time-varying reproduction number [2]. In R(t) particular, we model the intensity (rate) of infections as gives the probability of secondary infection i having been caused by primary infection j. Here, as in prior related works, the distribution of inter-event times is modeled as Weibull. Because mitigation (t ) w i − t j strategies (or the lack thereof) may influence the time distribution between primary and secondary infections, we estimate the Weibull parameters jointly with the model instead of specifying the parameters using reported incubation times. The baseline rate captures the rate of exogenous μ (imported) infections in a given region. The point process in Equation (1) can be viewed as an approximation to the common SIR model of infectious diseases during the initial phase of an epidemic when the total infections is small compared to the overall population size [3]. The model is estimated
7a9cb226022616147d04125c7f7fdf6223998964	Using mostly theoretical models and traditional risk/uncertainty measures (VIX index, panic, precaution, scary bad news, etc.), the current literature tries to clarify the risk/uncertaintydeleveraging pattern. The findings are not sufficient to explain the dynamic empirical relationship between modern risk/uncertainty indicators and leverage. We fill this gap in the literature by using US quarterly data, from 1985:1 to 2018:4, Granger causality tests, and a structural vector autoregression model. We find that commercial bank leverage rises when geopolitical risk and macroeconomic, policy, and equity uncertainty increase. Client-based business relationships of banks and high government borrowing from banks during crises periods are responsible for this relationship. We find that the leverage of broker-dealers and shadow banks declines when Chicago risk and macroeconomic, policy, financial, and equity uncertainty increase. We argue that the vulnerability of broker-dealers and shadow banks to the risk/uncertainty of the entire market system is responsible for this relationship. JEL classification: E44; E52; G23.
673fab4ff8140824a36b46c7094bc9562b670810	Although technology-based learning (TB-learning) has been accepted as an efficient educational tool in the field of dentistry, evaluation of TB-learning in non-prepared situations such as pandemics has not been fully investigated. This study aimed to evaluate different aspects of TB-learning among undergraduate dental students during the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19. Dental students in selected Iraqi universities (University of Baghdad, University of Sulaimani, and Dijlah University College) were invited to join the study. A questionnaire was created using a Google platform and answered by students. Satisfaction and attitude toward TB-learning plus total evaluation scores for lecturers were examined. A total of 832 out of 1800 dental students participated in the study. The majority of participants have basic (40.7%) and intermediate (47.5%) computer skills and more than half of them lack any experience in TB-learning. The overall satisfaction and positive attitude toward TB-learning was less than 50%. Students at final grade, with advanced computer skills and TBlearning experience showed higher satisfaction (OR: 3.031, 2.876, 3.644, respectively) and a more positive attitude (OR: 3.172, 3.035, 3.477, respectively) toward TB-learning than those at earlier grades. Total evaluation scores for lecturers were higher among females (11.5± 5.8) than males (9.9± 7.2) as well as among participants at final grade (14.0± 6.2), with advanced computer skills (13.8± 6.1), and TB-learning experience (16.2± 6.0). Dental students demonstrated low-moderate satisfaction and positive attitude toward TB-learning and the quality of material presented to them.

bb35acf637f45f1afca8b6df88ec85d6350a0008	The coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly worldwide, seriously endangering human health. In addition to the typical symptoms of pulmonary infection, patients with COVID-19 have been reported to have gastrointestinal symptoms and/or intestinal flora dysbiosis. It is known that a healthy intestinal flora is closely related to the maintenance of pulmonary and systemic health by regulating the host immune homeostasis. Role of the "gut-lung axis" has also been well-articulated. This review provides a novel suggestion that intestinal flora may be one of the mediators of the gastrointestinal responses and abnormal immune responses in hosts caused by SARS-CoV-2; improving the composition of intestinal flora and the proportion of its metabolites through probiotics, and personalized diet could be a potential strategy to prevent and treat COVID-19. More clinical and evidence-based medical trials may be initiated to determine the strategy.
8a84c8827f0a55d3a8b8efd1d3439de1738ddd6a	The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the epidemic potential of coronaviruses. The rapid spread of this virus across the world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause. We highlight the current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions concerning the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	Around 60% of pheasants released for shooting in the UK, an estimated 21 million birds, do not end up at their intended fate: being shot. This constitutes wastage, raising economic, environmental and ethical questions. We review what is known of the fates of released pheasants and consider why they do not directly contribute to the numbers harvested. We focus on four main explanations: predation, disease, starvation and dispersal, and highlight other important causes of mortality. For each explanation, we attempt to attribute levels of loss and identify timings or conditions when such losses may be heaviest. We review factors that exacerbate losses and methods available to mitigate them. Opportunities for amelioration may arise at all stages of the rearing and release of pheasants and involve changes to the conditions under which eggs are produced, the way young pheasants are reared or the management of the environment into which they are released. We found few studies investigating impacts of post-release management techniques on pheasant survival outside of the breeding season within a UK context. We found that a number of less commonly deployed practices focusing on early-life, pre-release management may improve survival. Given the scale of pheasant releasing in the UK, even improvements in survival of 1% would mean that~350,000 fewer birds die of natural causes. Complementing current post-release management with proven novel pre-release management interventions could reduce the number of pheasants required for release, whilst maintaining current shooting levels. Lowering release numbers would lower financial costs, benefit the environment and reduce some ethical concerns over the release and shooting of reared pheasants.
10e69f91c727119b63a5c85795d7cde7a315e53f	Despite fluctuations for economic or political reasons, the number of passengers and volume of cargo carried by air is growing quickly, leading to a shortage of airport capacity in some European regions with few slots available at some hubs. This problem has accelerated the trend towards an increase in airport capacity for larger aircraft everywhere, a process which started in the UK and is now continuing throughout Europe, especially in Germany. Apart from development at the hubs, however, many small airports have also been enlarged, former military airbases have been converted to civilian use, and new runways are to be built in areas away from centres of population. These changes have occurred within a short period of time. In Germany, the number of available airports with runways over 1800 m will have doubled in a period of 10-15 years.

ca70e687fe7d0471c95bc8e75b588860343fb0c6	This study examined links among unrealistic optimism, sex, and risk perception of type 2 diabetes onset in college students. Participants included 660 college students who consented to complete a questionnaire. The results showed significant differences between students who perceived that they were at risk for type 2 diabetes onset and those who thought their peers were the ones at risk. A higher prevalence of participants thought their peers were the ones at risk for type 2 diabetes. Women were more likely than men to report a higher risk perception, indicating that their peers were at lower risk for diabetes onset.
3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393	The filoviruses Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus are among the deadliest viral pathogens known to infect humans, causing emerging diseases with fatality rates of up to 90% during some outbreaks. The replication cycles of these viruses are comprised of numerous complex molecular processes and interactions with their human host, with one key feature being the means by which nascent virions exit host cells to spread to new cells and ultimately to a new host. This review focuses on our current knowledge of filovirus egress and the viral and host factors and processes that are involved. Within the virus, these factors consist of the major matrix protein, viral protein 40 (VP40), which is necessary and sufficient for viral particle release, and nucleocapsid and glycoprotein that interact with VP40 to promote egress. In the host cell, some proteins are hijacked by filoviruses in order to enhance virion budding capacity that include members of the family of E3 ubiquitin ligase and the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, while others such as tetherin inhibit viral egress. An understanding of these molecular interactions that modulate viral particle egress provides an important opportunity to identify new targets for the development of antivirals to prevent and treat filovirus infections.
9c3444c245c367d032795fe2f403eb0a704a5ddd	This study provides data on the feasibility and impact of video-enabled telemedicine use among patients and providers and its impact on urgent and non-urgent health care delivery from one large health system (NYU Langone Health) at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Between March 2nd and April 14th 2020, telemedicine visits increased from 369.1 daily to 866.8 daily (135% increase) in urgent care after the system-wide expansion of virtual health visits in response to COVID-19, and from 94.7 daily to 4209.3 (4345% increase) in non-urgent care post expansion. Of all virtual visits post expansion, 56.2% and 17.6% urgent and non-urgent visits, respectively, were COVID-19-related. Telemedicine usage was highest by patients aged 20-44, particularly for urgent care. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven rapid expansion of telemedicine use for urgent care and non-urgent care visits beyond baseline periods. This reflects an important change in telemedicine that other institutions facing the COVID-19 pandemic should anticipate.

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an uncommon vascular tumor, which typically occurs in liver, lung or bone. We present an extremely rare case of primary pleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma mimicking pleural empyema. We conclude, that pleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis in patients suspected of empyema. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Case Report
d4953e2a564f68bc7eccd8d1af12da3c2c5bbf7c	Activity detection from first-person videos (FPV) captured using a wearable camera is an active research field with potential applications in many sectors, including healthcare, law enforcement, and rehabilitation. State-of-the-art methods use optical flow-based hybrid techniques that rely on features derived from the motion of objects from consecutive frames. In this work, we developed a two-stream network, the SegCodeNet, that uses a network branch containing video-streams with color-coded semantic segmentation masks of relevant objects in addition to the original RGB video-stream. We also include a stream-wise attention gating that prioritizes between the two streams and a frame-wise attention module that prioritizes the video frames that contain relevant features. Experiments are conducted on an FPV dataset containing 18 activity classes in office environments. In comparison to a single-stream network, the proposed twostream method achieves an absolute improvement of 14.366% and 10.324% for averaged F1 score and accuracy, respectively, when average results are compared for three different frame sizes 224×224, 112×112, and 64×64. The proposed method provides significant performance gains for lower-resolution images with absolute improvements of 17% and 26% in F1 score for input dimensions of 112 × 112 and 64 × 64, respectively. The best performance is achieved for a frame size of 224 × 224 yielding an F1 score and accuracy of 90.176% and 90.799% which outperforms the state-of-the-art Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) [1] method by an absolute margin of 4.529% and 2.419%, respectively.
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	Tomographic imaging has benefited from advances in X-ray sources, detectors and optics to enable novel observations in science, engineering and medicine. These advances have come with a dramatic increase of input data in the form of faster frame rates, larger fields of view or higher resolution, so high performance solutions are currently widely used for analysis. Tomographic instruments can vary significantly from one to another, including the hardware employed for reconstruction: from single CPU workstations to large scale hybrid CPU/GPU supercomputers. Flexibility on the software interfaces and reconstruction engines are also highly valued to allow for easy development and prototyping. This paper presents a novel software framework for tomographic analysis that tackles all aforementioned requirements. The proposed solution capitalizes on the increased performance of sparse matrixvector multiplication and exploits multi-CPU and GPU reconstruction over MPI. The solution is implemented in Python and relies on CuPy for fast GPU operators and CUDA kernel integration, and on SciPy for CPU sparse matrix computation. As opposed to previous tomography solutions that are tailor-made for specific use cases or hardware, the proposed software is designed to provide flexible, portable and highperformance operators that can be used for continuous integration at different production environments, but also for prototyping new experimental settings or for algorithmic development. The experimental results demonstrate how our implementation can even outperform state-of-theart software packages used at advanced X-ray sources worldwide.
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	Very often, university students deliberately form self-organized study groups, e.g. to study collaboratively for an upcoming exam. Yet, very little is known about what regulation problems such self-organized study groups encounter during their learning process and how they try to cope with these problems. Therefore, this study investigates how completely self-organized groups (i.e., non-guided groups outside the classroom that form without external impulse) regulate their collaborative learning process when faced with different kinds of regulation problems. More specifically, we tested the hypotheses that members of self-organized study groups are more satisfied with their group learning experience (a) the more homogeneous their problem perceptions are within their group, (b) the more they apply immediate (rather than non-immediate) strategies to remedy their regulation problems, and (c) the more frequently they apply regulation strategies. In a longitudinal study, N = 122 students, voluntarily studying for their exams in N = 52 groups, were asked to indicate the types of problems they experienced, the types of strategies they used to tackle those problems, and their satisfaction with their group learning experience after each of their self-organized study meetings. Hierarchical linear modeling confirmed all hypotheses. Qualitative analysis of two selected groups' selfreported situational data provided additional insights about the mechanisms that may have contributed to the results. Our study provides important directions for future research, including the recommendation to identify the processes by which groups (a) can reach homogeneity of problem perceptions and (b) coordinate the choice of appropriate strategies within the group. An enduring theme of CSCL research has been the question of how computer-supported collaborative learning can be structured so that learning outcomes at the individual level (such as knowledge acquisition; e.g., Haake and Pfister 2010) or at the group level (such as quality of a group product; e.g., Popov et al. 2017) can be improved when compared to unstructured CSCL. Much of this research has been centered on the concept of collaboration scripts (e.g., Fischer et al. 2013; Rummel et al. 2009 ). Collaboration scripts scaffold the collaboration process within groups by specifying, sequencing and distributing activities and roles among the learners of a group (Kollar et al. 2006) . Even though such scripts generally have been shown to be effective (Vogel et al. 2017) , their application "in the wild", i.e., in informal, selfguided learning contexts, is not unproblematic, as scholars have criticized collaboration scripts for possibly over-structuring the learning process so that collaboration might become a highly coercive experience ("over-scripting"; Dillenbourg 2002), though recent work challenges this concern (Radkowitsch et al. 2020). Especially self-organized groups, i.e., groups that students form completely voluntarily based on their own initiative outside regular classroom contexts (e.g., to jointly study for an upcoming exam), might find discomfort in following such finegrained externally imposed instructions. It is believed that this, in turn might even result in hampering effective learning (Raes et al. 2016; Vauras et al. 2003) . Although it is a very common form of collaborative learning, CSCL research has not extensively addressed self-organized collaborative learning thus far. Exceptions are studies by Hadwin et al. (2018) and Volet et al. (2009) , who suggested that groups need help in joint planning (e.g., to help learners share their understanding of the given tasks) or in the selection of effective strategies (e.g., to help them ask effective questions). Nevertheless, collaboration in such studies was still structured at least in the sense that students were obliged to work at the university, to collaborate mainly using a computer, and to work uniformly on predetermined tasks for a predetermined number of study meetings. Thus, evidence on how completely selforganized groups regulate their learning in authentic contexts is still very scarce. This is regrettable, especially in the light of the current COVID-19 crisis, during which self-organized, technology-enhanced collaboration might have tremendous potential to enhance learning. Therefore, this study tries to uncover what differentiates successful from less successful selforganized collaborative learning, in an attempt to derive implications for further research on how to design instructional support for this kind of (computer-supported) collaborative learning. In the present article, we conceptualize collaboration in self-organized study groups as an instance of (socially) self-regulated learning (Järvelä and Hadwin 2013) that requires groups to make decisions on their own learning process (e.g., concerning questions such as when and how long to meet, how to approach comprehension problems, or what technology to use during collaboration) (Zimmerman and Moylan 2009). Then, we describe typical problems during self-organized collaborative learning, thereby differentiating between coordinationrelated problems, motivational problems, and comprehension-related problems (Järvelä and Järvenoja 2011; Kirschner et al. 2008) . Based on this, we develop a theoretical model that systematically embeds three precursors of students' satisfaction with their group learning experience into the regulatory process. We assume that groups should be more satisfied with their group learning experience the more they (a) have a homogeneous problem perception and (b) use strategies that are immediate with respect to resolving the given regulation problem, and the more intensively they (c) apply regulation strategies. We tested these assumptions in an N. Melzner et al.
00aa9cbf61505e3fa77ef009eafe04300a5c39b2	Rabies is one of the most deadly infectious diseases, with a case-fatality rate approaching 100%. The disease is established on all continents apart from Antarctica; most cases are reported in Africa and Asia, with thousands of deaths recorded annually. However, the estimated annual fi gure of almost 60 000 human rabies fatalities is probably an underestimate. Almost all cases of human rabies result from bites from infected dogs. Therefore, the most cost-eff ective approach to elimination of the global burden of human rabies is to control canine rabies rather than expansion of the availability of human prophylaxis. Mass vaccination campaigns with parenteral vaccines, and advances in oral vaccines for wildlife, have allowed the elimination of rabies in terrestrial carnivores in several countries worldwide. The subsequent reduction in cases of human rabies in such regions advocates the multidisciplinary One Health approach to rabies control through the mass vaccination of dogs and control of canine populations.
84efaac896e551763256fd4d16e56a99b416c175	The recent discovery that malignant neoplastic lesions date back nearly 2 million years ago not only highlights the antiquity of cancer in the human lineage, but also provides remarkable insight into ancestral hominin disease pathology. Using these Early Pleistocene examples as a point of departure, we emphasize the prominent role of viral and bacterial pathogens in oncogenesis and evaluate the impact of pathogens on human evolutionary processes in Africa. In the Shakespearean vernacular "what's past is prologue," we highlight the significance of novel information derived from ancient pathogenic DNA. In particular, and given the temporal depth of human occupation in sub-Saharan Africa, it is emphasized that the region is ideally positioned to play a strategic role in the discovery of ancient pathogenic drivers of not only human mortality, but also human evolution. Ancient African pathogen genome data can provide novel revelations concerning human-pathogen coevolutionary processes, and such knowledge is essential for forecasting the ways in which emerging zoonotic and increasingly transmissible diseases might influence human demography and longevity in the future.

It had been more than 30 years in the making. Catalogues of available medicines and their composition have gradually evolved. The British National War Formulary, a "selection of medicaments sufficient in range to meet ordinary requirements of therapeutics" was in this mould, but the new-style British National Formulary (BNF), first published in 1981, contains in addition essential information on the indications, contraindications, cautions, dosage, and drug interactions of almost all licensed medicines used in general practice, and most drugs used in hospitals. The Medicines Act 1968 and its European successors demand that marketing authorizations ("licences") are only issued if medicines fulfil three criteria-quality of manufacture, efficacy in the licensed indication, and reasonable safety. These are not, however, sufficient to ensure safe, rational, and cost-effective therapeutic choices. There are several reasons for this. 2 | PROBLEMS 2.1 | Multiplicity of medicines There is a multiplicity of agents with similar or identical therapeutic properties. The current BNF lists 14 beta-blockers licensed for treatment of arterial hypertension: 10 angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors; eight angiotensin-2 antagonists, eight calcium antagonists, and five diuretics; and at least 25 preparations combining two or more anti-hypertensives. The mere existence of so many alternatives means that patient safety is compromised by the potential for confusion among and between drugs of the same class but with different properties or dosage. There are also financial consequences, because some drugs may be more costly than others and because the need to keep several very similar drugs in stock carries costs both in acquisition (and wastage) and in space for storage. Thus, choosing to limit the local availability of drugs with similar actions should make patients safer and should reduce costs. © 2019 The British Pharmacological Society Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2019;86:10-12. R.S. chairs and R.E.F. has chaired drug and therapeutics committees; both have sat on other committees related to the safe, rational, and cost-effective use of medicines.

06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	Introduction: Infectious acute respiratory disease (ARD) is a significant cause of worldwide morbidity, disproportionately affecting individuals living in crowded conditions, such as found at military training centers, school dormitories, and correctional facilities. Vaccines have been used to protect against ARD; however, these are not always available or effective. The medical literature on preventive nonvaccine ARD interventions (NOVARDIs) for infectious diseases, which addressed personal measures, administrative controls, and engineering controls, was studied during 2000 to 2004. Population-based studies in community settings (non-health care) were reviewed in detail to evaluate the effectiveness of NOVARDIs. Budgetary and logistic factors as well as acceptance were considered in formulating recommendations for implementation of NOVARDIs in military training centers. Thirty-eight population-based studies contained in 35 publications were examined. Three studies contained information on multiple NOVARDIs. Nine studies supported the use of personal measures relating to hand hygiene. Ten studies supported administrative controls such as cohorting military training units to reduce contact between units (4 studies), providing adequate personal space to reduce crowding (5), and cloth barriers between beds (1); and 14 studies supported the use of engineering controls such as increased indoor air dilution and ventilation (2), dust suppression (4), and air sterilization (8). Conclusions: Promoting hand hygiene and reducing crowding through the provision of adequate living space and cohorting of training units may offer benefits in respiratory disease control. These interventions, along with UV lights and air dilution/ventilation, deserve further evaluation in controlled studies to assess their efficacy. NOVARDIs could benefit military and other populations living in close contact. (Am J Prev Med 2005;28(3):305-316)
f673dc1b40947d0db162e1c9e84b188bba21e33f	Objective: This study was designed to investigate the change of various indexes in patients with different types of coronavirus disease 2019 . Methods: 75 COVID-19 patients were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and they were classified into moderate, severe and critically severe types according to the disease severity. The basic information, blood routine, pneumonia-related blood indexes, immune-related indexes along with liver, kidney and myocardial indexes in patients with different types were analyzed. The analysis of immune-related indexes showed that the proportions of critically severe patients with abnormal IL-2 and IL-4 were higher than those of severe and moderate patients. In addition, the proportion of patients with abnormal total cholesterol increased as the severity of disease increased, and the proportion in critically severe patients was significantly higher than that in moderate patients.
c185afd51440eb8102a60ce7b3858e9a85a24c94	Rationale for the study: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses is more sensitive, yet more expensive, than conventionally used direct immunofluorescence (DIF). We determined the impact of real-time PCR, additional to DIF, on antibiotic prescription in ventilated children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) at admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Methods: First, a multicenter survey study was performed. Subsequently, in a prospective study, children ( 5 years) with LRTI were tested at admission by DIF and PCR. Positive DIF results were reported at the end of the first working day. PICU physicians reported antibiotic treatment on the second working day. After informing them of the PCR result antibiotic treatment was reevaluated. Results: The multicenter survey study (94 respondents) showed that PCR decreased antibiotic use (P < 0.001). In the prospective study 38 children were included, of which 19 (50%) were DIF positive. Of the 19 DIF negative patients 12 (63%) were treated with antibiotics before revealing the PCR result; the PCR test was positive in 9 out of 12. Revealing PCR results did not alter antibiotic treatment. In 7 DIF negative patients antibiotics not given, the PCR test was positive. Conclusion: In contrast to their responses to the survey study, in real-life PICU physicians did not let their antibiotic prescription be influenced by respiratory real-time PCR in children ventilated for LRTI.
947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	Periodontal diseases are initiated by bacterial species living in polymicrobial biofilms at or below the gingival margin and progress largely as a result of the inflammation initiated by specific subgingival species. In the past few decades, efforts to understand the microbiota of periodontal diseases have led to an exponential increase in information about biofilms associated with periodontal health and disease. In fact, the oral microbiota is one of the best characterized microbiomes that colonize the human body. Despite this increased knowledge, one has to ask if our fundamental concepts of the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontal diseases have really changed. In this chapter we will review how our comprehension of the structure and function of the subgingival microbiota evolved over the years in search of lessons learned and unlearned in periodontal microbiology. More specifically, this review focuses on: 1) how the data obtained through molecular techniques has impacted our knowledge of the etiology of periodontal infections; 2) the potential role of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of periodontal diseases; 3) how concepts of microbial ecology have expanded our understanding of host microbial interactions that might lead to periodontal diseases; 4) the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; and 5) the impact of these evolving concepts on treatment and preventive approaches to periodontal infections. We will conclude by reviewing how novel systems biology approaches promise to unravel new details of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases and, hopefully, lead to a better understanding of periodontal disease mechanisms.
534bc15ce844653ae863844b86d4ace2b98d42a3	The aim of this study was molecular identification of Cryptosporidium species and assessment of their prevalence in different breeds of sheep and goat reared in Poland. In addition, the relationship between animal age, breed type, and the frequency of Cryptosporidium infections was determined. Fecal samples from 234 lambs and 105 goat kids aged up to 9 weeks, representing 24 breeds and their cross-breeds were collected from 71 small ruminant farms across Poland. The identification of Cryptosporidium species was performed at the 18 SSU ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and COWP loci followed by subtyping of C. parvum and C. hominis strains at GP60 gene locus. The presence of Cryptosporidium DNA at the 18 SSU rRNA locus was detected in 45/234 (19.2%) lamb feces samples and in 39/105 (37.1%) taken from goats. The following Cryptosporidium species: C. xiaoi, C. bovis, C. ubiquitum, C. parvum, and C. hominis were detected in small ruminants. Infections caused by C. xiaoi were predominant without favoring any tested animal species. Subsequent GP60 subtyping revealed the presence of C. parvum IIaA17G1R1 subtype in sheep and IIdA23G1 subtype in goats. IIdA23G1 subtype was detected in a goat host for the first time. There were no significant differences found in frequency of infections between the age groups (<3 and 3-9 weeks) of lambs (P = 0.14, α > 0.05) or goat kids (P = 0.06, α > 0.05). In addition, there was no correlation observed between the frequency in occurrence of particular parasite species and breed type in relation to native sheep breeds (F = 0.11; P = 0.990 > 0.05). In the case of goats, more breed-related differences in parasite occurrence were found. The results of this study improve our knowledge on the breedrelated occurrence of Cryptosporidium infections in the population of small ruminants reared in Poland.
21cd719e5480e0282de2d85711fe1ace945d591a	In the United States and around the world, COVID-19 represents a mass fatality incident, as there are more bodies than can be handled using existing resources. Although the management and disposition of bodies is distressing and heartrending, it is a task that local, state, and federal governments must plan for and respond to collaboratively with the private sector and faith-based community. When mass fatalities are mismanaged, there are grave emotional and mental health consequences that can delay recovery and undermine community resilience. Using insights from one of the author's mass fatality management research during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, this article explores how mass fatalities are being managed in response to COVID-19. Based on the researcher's findings a decade ago, it is apparent that many lessons have not been learnt. This This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Accepted Article article concludes by providing governments with practical lessons on how to manage mass fatalities to facilitate and promote community resilience.

9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	Objective Influenza virus infections cause a high disease and economic burden during seasonal epidemics. However, there is still a need for reliable disease burden estimates to provide a more detailed picture of the impact of influenza. Therefore, the objectives of this study is to estimate the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza virus infection and associated hospitalisation costs in adult patients in the Netherlands during two consecutive influenza seasons. Methods We conducted a retrospective study in adult patients with a laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection in three Dutch hospitals during respiratory seasons 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. Incidence was calculated as the weekly number of hospitalised influenza patients divided by the total population in the catchment populations of the three hospitals. Arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were estimated and included costs for emergency department consultation, diagnostics, general ward and/or intensive care unit admission, isolation, antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment. These hospitalisation costs were extrapolated to national level and expressed in 2017 euros. The study population consisted of 380 hospitalised adult influenza patients. The seasonal cumulative incidence was 3.5 cases per 10,000 persons in respiratory season 2014-2015, compared to 1.8 cases per 10,000 persons in 2015-2016. The arithmetic mean hospitalisation cost per influenza patient was €6128 (95% CI €4934-€7737) per patient in 2014-2015 and €8280 (95% CI €6254-€10,665) in 2015-2016, potentially reaching total hospitalisation costs of €28 million in 2014-2015 and €20 million in 2015-2016. Conclusions Influenza virus infections lead to 1.8-3.5 hospitalised patients per 10,000 persons, with mean hospitalisation costs of €6100-€8300 per adult patient, resulting in 20-28 million euros annually in The Netherlands. The highest arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were found in the 45-64 year age group. These influenza burden estimates could be used for future influenza cost-effectiveness and impact studies.
6dbe565e85a32fccee31cbecda4db86adeb0ea65	Background: The number of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Japan are substantially lower in comparison to the US and UK, potentially due to the under-implementation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Studies reported that more than half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, confirming the importance for conducting seroepidemiological studies. Although the seroepidemiological studies in Japan observed a reported prevalence of 0.10% in Tokyo, 0.17% in Osaka, and 0.03% in Miyagi, sampling bias was not considered. The study objective was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a random sample of households in Utsunomiya City in Tochigi Prefecture, Greater Tokyo, Japan. Association (U-CORONA) Study to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Utsunomiya City. The survey was conducted between 14 June 2020 and 5 July 2020, in between the first and second wave of the pandemic. Invitations enclosed with a questionnaire were sent to 2,290 people in 1,000 households randomly selected from Utsunomiya basic resident registry. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The level of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. Results: Among 2,290 candidates, 753 returned the questionnaire and 742 received IgG tests (32.4 % participation rate). Of the 742 participants, 86.8% were 18 years or older, 52.6% were women, 71.1% were residing within 10 km from the test clinic, and 89.2% were living with another person. The age and sex distribution, distance to clinic and police district were similar with those of non-participants, while the proportion of single-person households was higher among non-participants than participants (16.2% vs. 10.8%). We confirmed three positive cases through quantitative antibody testing. No positive cases were found among the people who live in the same household as someone with positive. All cases were afebrile. The estimated unweighted and weighted prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 0.40% (95% confidence interval: 0.08-1.18%) and 1.23% (95% confidence interval: 0.17-2.28%), respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests the importance of detecting all cases using PCR or antigen testing, not only at a hospital, but also in areas where people assemble. Further prospective studies using this cohort are needed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.
c91ef2903f29ed2b114a2b8f935f9c872158e49d	Purpose: Assessment of the superstitious belief that saying the word "quiet" during an on-call period in Oral and Maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) causes a disproportionate increase in workload. A 2-armed, single centre randomised trial was performed in a single-blinded fashion within the OMFS department at Addenbrookes hospital, Cambridge. Duty on-call OMFS SHO's were assigned to a "quiet group" and "Non-quiet group". Former group actively told on-call period would be quiet whilst this word was refrained from use in all contexts in the latter. Results: Data was collected from 8am to 7pm from a period spanning a total of 40 week-day oncalls. Total number of bleeps encountered was 491, average bleep count per day irrespective of treatment was 12.3 (SD 4.6). Bleep count for the control group and 13.1 (4.9) bleeps for the quiet (treatment) group. Welches independent-sample T test identified no significant difference in the mean number of bleeps encountered between treatment and control groups. Moreover, ANOVA identified no significant difference in mean number of bleeps between days (F(4,35) = 0.086, p = 0.986). Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.6.2 Our study refutes the central dogma of all of medicine that suggests saying the word quiet increases clinician workload during the working day. We identified no significant difference in bleep number between different days of the week.

While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.
c377c497135c1f3103d8bc7ed5988b44eb6e6603	The Smart Grids (SGs) consist of an emerging paradigm that pave the way for the power grids' modernization and seek novel techniques for improving the transmittion and distribution of power to consumers, as well as achieving end-to-end real-time governance. Thus, the prospect of SGs are to behave intelligently, through the deployment of advanced technologies, applications and standards. A subset of such technologies and applications consists of Software Defined Netowrks (SDNs), Cloud Computing (CC), Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, Big Data applications, Internet-of-Things (IoT), 5G and wireless standards such as IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE 802.16.1. The SGs, the CC and the IoT paradigms' convergence lie on satisfying the clients' needs, improving efficiency and in the same time maintaining overall control. However, the coupling of diverse technologies under a unified architecture raise multiple interdependencies which pose new challenges, ranging from the reliability of the whole power system to novel cyber-security risks. This paper sheds new light in the overall definition of the threat landscape that emerges by the convergence of CC and IoT in a SG.
e1fc479aa176ed4d5fd4f6076befdf518d3d4f02	Numerous drugs are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19, including antivirals and therapies targeting complications related to COVID-19. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies from mild fever, cough, and dyspnea in the early stages of disease to severe complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic hyperinflammation, and sepsis. A thorough understanding of the disease pathogenesis and the disease complications is essential to developing effective therapies to treat this potentially life-threatening disease. This review offers key clinical pharmacology considerations involved in the development of small molecules for the treatment of COVID-19. They are based on the major observed disease complications that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. We also address considerations regarding potential drug interactions, alternative routes and methods of administration, and dosing in patients on hemodialysis.
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	However, the biological properties of these bat-derived influenza viruses (BatIVs) are still largely unknown since infectious viral particles have never been isolated from the infected host species. In this study, a reverse genetics approach was used to generate infectious BatIV particles entirely from plasmids encoding full-length sequences in eight gene segments. We inoculated BatIV particles into various cell cultures including bat-derived cell lines and found that BatIVs infected particular batderived cells efficiently but not the other cell lines tested. Reassortant viruses between the two BatIVs were also successfully generated and their replication in the susceptible bat cell lines was confirmed. These findings suggest a limited host range and reassortment potential of BatIVs in nature, providing fundamental information for understanding of the ecology of BatIVs. Influenza A viruses (IAVs), which belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, cause highly contagious diseases in a wide variety of avian and mammalian species, including humans, pigs, horses, dogs, and poultry, and are recognized as one of the most important zoonotic pathogens. IAVs have 8 segmented negative-sense RNA genomes and are divided into subtypes based on combination of two viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). IAVs with H1-16 HA and N1-9 NA subtypes have been identified in wild aquatic birds, especially migratory ducks, the natural reservoir of IAVs 1-4 . Importantly, due to their propensity for genetic reassortment, a variety of IAV subtypes are distributed in many host species. Recently, influenza virus-like RNA genomes were detected in fruit bats (Sturnira lilium and Artibeus planirostris) in Central and South America 5,6 . Since the amino acid sequences of their HA and NA are distinct from those of all previously known IAV subtypes, these bat-derived influenza viruses (BatIVs) were provisionally designated H17N10 and H18N11. However, previous studies have reported that H17 HA does not bind to sialic acids linked to galactose in sugar chains 7 , which are known as canonical receptors of IAVs, and that N10 NA lacks neuraminidase activity 8 which is also a common property of all known influenza viruses. Thus, BatIV glycoproteins have also been called HA-like (HL) and NA-like (NL) (i.e., HL17NL10 and HL18NL11) 9 . However, information on the biological properties of these BatIVs is limited since infectious virus particles have never been isolated from infected animals. Bats belonging to the order Chiroptera, which is known as the second largest order of mammalians, are distributed into more than 1,000 species globally 10 . It has been shown that bats play crucial roles as natural reservoirs of some zoonotic pathogens such as Marburg virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Lyssa virus, SARS, and MERS coronaviruses 11-14 . Thus, it is important to investigate the ecology of bat-derived pathogens and to clarify their potential risks as zoonotic pathogens. Our previous study revealed that vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) pseudotyped with BatIV glycoproteins efficiently infected cultured cells derived from particular bat species (e.g., Miniopterus fuliginosus) but not those commonly used for IAV propagation and other bat cells tested, providing key information on cell lines that are Published: xx xx xxxx opeN www.nature.com/scientificreports/
1b4d2b000ee885e242aa3b237597158d17889125	Pro-protein convertase-2 (PC2) and carboxypeptidase-E (CPE) proteins are two major members of the pro-protein convertases that involve in the maturation of protein precursor. By using PC2 activity, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Western blot method, PC2, CPE and preproNPY protein expression levels were compared among mature retina tissue, RGC-5 cells and its differentiated cells, or brain cortex tissue, NS20Y tumor cells and its differentiated cells, or mature breast tissue, breast tumor cell RM1 and breast adenocarcinoma tissue. The experimental results indicated that the differentiated cells or tissues had higher or highest PC2 activity. In the comparative experiments, more PC2 protein expression in the mature tissues and more CPE and preproNPY protein expression in the tumor cells or tumor tissue were observed, but no expression of preproNPY protein was observed in the mature tissues. Compared with NS20Y or RGC-5 undifferentiated cells, its differentiated cells showed less proPC2, more proCPE and more preproNPY protein expressions. The results demonstrated that the mature tissues showed stronger PC2/CPE-mediated pro-protein processing ability than the tumor cells or tissue. The results also showed that the artificial differentiation of RGC-5 or NS20Y cells was different from maturation of its corresponding normal tissue.
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	Introduction: Since December 29, 2019 a pandemic of new novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia named COVID-19 has started from Wuhan (China) has led to 254 996 confirmed cases until midday March 20, 2020. Sporadic cases have been imported worldwide, in Algeria, the first case reported on February 25, 2020 was imported from Italy, and then the epidemic has spread to other parts of the country very quickly with 90 confirmed cases until March 19, 2020. It is crucial to estimate the cases number growth in the early stages of the outbreak, to this end, we have implemented the Alg-COVID-19 Model which allows to predict the incidence and the reproduction number R0 in the coming months in order to help decision makers. The Alg-COVIS-19 Model initial equation (1) estimates the incidence (cases number) at (t) prediction time using two parameters: the reproduction number (R0) and the serial interval (SI) Results: We found R0=2.56 (95% CI 2.16-2.98) based on actual incidence at the first 23 days, using the serial interval SI= 4,4 and the prediction time t=23. The herd immunity HI estimated is HI=61%. Also, The Covid-19 incidence predicted with the Alg-COVID-19 Model fits closely the actual incidence during the first 23 days of the epidemic in Algeria (Fig.

Some of these outbreaks had unusually high numbers of fatalities and this generated much fear and anxiety in the region. We established a sentinel surveillance programme for hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak, Malaysia, in March 1998, and the observations of the first 7 years are described here. Virus isolation, serotyping and genotyping were performed on throat, rectal, vesicle and other swabs. : During this period Sarawak had two outbreaks of human enterovirus 71, in 2000 and 2003. The predominant strains circulating in the outbreaks of 1997, 2000 and 2003 were all from genogroup B, but the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically distinct from each other. Human enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every three years and Coxsackievirus A16 co-circulated with human enterovirus 71. Although vesicles were most likely to yield an isolate, this sample was not generally available from most cases and obtaining throat swabs was thus found to be the most efficient way to obtain virological information. Knowledge of the epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 transmission will allow public health personnel to predict when outbreaks might occur and to plan interventions in an effective manner in order to reduce the burden of disease.
8878430aac1b32809652a81f70671e236a9fc5bc	The speed and scale of the global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented pressures on health services worldwide, requiring new methods of service delivery during the health crisis. In the setting of severe resource constraint and high risk of infection to patients and clinicians, there is an urgent need to identify consensus statements on head and neck surgical oncology practice. We completed a modified Delphi consensus process of three rounds with 40 international experts in head and neck cancer surgical, radiation, and medical oncology, representing 35 international professional societies and national clinical trial groups. Endorsed by 39 societies and professional bodies, these consensus practice recommendations aim to decrease inconsistency of practice, reduce uncertainty in care, and provide reassurance for clinicians worldwide for head and neck surgical oncology in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the setting of acute severe resource constraint and high risk of infection to patients and staff.
90bf3caf925c494853bd4cd4e86153dd523c7d31	The world is currently witnessing a dramatic disruption of everyday life owing to the rapid progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the pandemic evolves, there is an urgent need to better understand its epidemiology, characterize its potential impact, and identify mitigatory strategies to avert pandemic-related mortality. There is a need for a tool or algorithm to evaluate the extent to which public health policy and/or economic preparedness measures are effectively averting COVID-19 related mortality. We present a simple and yet practical epidemiological tool, the Pandemic Efficiency Index (PEI), that can be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from COVID-19 infection. Using the PEI and current COVID-19-related mortality, we determined that so far Germany demonstrates the highest PEI (5.1) among countries with more than 5,000 recorded cases of the infection, indicating high quality measures instituted by the country to avert death during the pandemic. Italy and France currently have the lowest COVID-19-related PEIs. Epidemics and pandemics come and go, but local, national, and global abilities to determine the efficiency of their efforts in averting deaths is critical.

Latin hypercube 33 sampling and maximum likelihood estimation were used to calibrate to cumulative 34 cases and cumulative deaths. 35 Setting: SW at a time considered early in the pandemic, where National Health 36 Service (NHS) authorities required evidence to guide localised planning and support 37 decision-making. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The expected numbers of infected 40 cases, deaths due to COVID-19 infection, patient occupancy of acute and IC beds and 41 the reproduction ("R") number over time. 42 Results: SW model projections indicate that, as of the 11 th May 2020 (when 43 'lockdown' measures were eased), 5,793 (95% credible interval, CrI, 2,003 -12,051) 44 individuals were still infectious (0.10% of the total SW England population, 95%CrI 45 0.04 -0.22%), and a total of 189,048 (95%CrI 141,580 -277,955) had been infected 46 with the virus (either asymptomatically or symptomatically), but recovered, which is 47 3.4% (95%CrI 2.5 -5.0%) of the SW population. The total number of patients in acute 48 and IC beds in the SW on the 11 th May 2020 was predicted to be 701 (95%CrI 169 -49 1,543) and 110 (95%CrI 8 -464) respectively. The R value in SW England was 50 predicted to be 2.6 (95%CrI 2.0 -3.2) prior to any interventions, with social distancing 51 .

We present the model trajectories for SW England using publicly-available 120 data. 121 122 Methods We developed a deterministic, ordinary differential equation model of the 124 transmission dynamics of COVID-19, including age-structured contact patterns, age 125 specific disease progression and demand for hospitalisation, both to acute and IC. We 126 then parameterised the model using available literature and calibrated the model to 127 data from the SW. The model is readily adapted to fit data at sub-regional (e.g. Clinical 128 Commissioning Group), regional or national level. Key assumptions of the model are 129 summarised in the supplementary information. 130 The model was developed in R and all code and links to source data are freely 131 available (github.com/rdbooton/bricovmod). The model is coded using package 132 deSolve, with contact matrices from package socialmixr, and sampling from package 133 lhs. 134 Model structure The stages of COVID-19 included within this model are -susceptible, -exposed (not 136 currently infectious, but have been exposed to the virus), -asymptomatic infection 137 (will never develop symptoms), -symptomatic infection (consisting of pre-138 symptomatic or mild to moderate symptoms), -severe symptoms requiring 139 hospitalisation but not IC, -very severe symptoms requiring IC, -recovered and -140 death.

These effects surely will continue to magnify as practical concerns for Engineering Geologists, not the least of which will be slope instability. Worldwide, the profession appeared to be in a truly advanced state, as marked by a new high in indigenous practice, a broad base of authors in this journal, and of cooperation between practitioners of the various nations.

b9a8782661a61d1562b8d6a2098fd35c76b35349	Our understanding of how antibodies are generated and function could help develop effective vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics against viruses such as HIV-1, SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), and Hendra and Nipah viruses (henipaviruses). Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the HIV-1 were observed in patients, elicitation of such bnAbs remains a major challenge when compared to other viral targets. We previously hypothesized that HIV-1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response. To further explore our hypothesis, we used the 454 sequence analysis of a large naïve library of human IgM antibodies which had been used for selecting antibodies against SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble G proteins (sG) of henipaviruses. We found that the human IgM repertoires from the 454 sequencing have diverse germline usages, recombination patterns, junction diversity, and a lower extent of somatic mutation. In this study, we identified antibody maturation intermediates that are related to bnAbs against the HIV-1 and other viruses as observed in normal individuals, and compared their genetic diversity and somatic mutation level along with available structural and functional data. Further computational analysis will provide framework for understanding the underlying genetic and molecular determinants related to maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs that could be useful for applying novel approaches to the design of effective vaccine immunogens and antibody-based therapeutics.
3af4b6bdf86ac98834c2099c89b7020e68398594	Smart contracts can be regarded as one of the most popular blockchain-based applications. The decentralized nature of the blockchain introduces vulnerabilities absent in other programs. Furthermore, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to patch a smart contract after it has been deployed. Therefore, smart contracts must be formally verified before they are deployed on the blockchain to avoid attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities. There is a recent surge of interest in analyzing and verifying smart contracts. While most of the existing works either focus on EVM bytecode or translate Solidity contracts into programs in intermediate languages for analysis and verification, we believe that a direct executable formal semantics of the high-level programming language of smart contracts is necessary to guarantee the validity of the verification. In this work, we propose a generalized formal semantic framework based on a general semantic model of smart contracts. Furthermore, this framework can directly handle smart contracts written in different high-level programming languages through semantic extensions and facilitates the formal verification of security properties with the generated semantics.
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	We uncover and highlight the importance of social distancing duration and intensity in lowering hospitalization demand-to-supply during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the USA. We have developed an epidemic progression model involving the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamics, the age-stratified disease transmissibility, and the possible large-scale undocumented (i.e., asymptomatic and/or untested) transmission of COVID-19 taking place in the USA. Our analysis utilizes COVID-19 observational data in the USA between March 19 and 28, corresponding to the early stage of the epidemic when the impacts of social distancing on disease progression were yet to manifest. Calibrating our model using epidemiological data from this time period enabled us to unbiasedly address the question "How long and with what intensity does the USA need to implement social distancing intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic?" For a short (i.e., up to two weeks) duration, we find a near-linear decrease in hospital beds demand with increasing intensity (ϕ) of social distancing. For a duration longer than two weeks, our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. Long-term implementation of strict social distancing with ϕ > 50% could lead to the emergence of a second wave of infections due to a large residual susceptible population which highlights the need for contact tracing and isolation before re-opening of the economy. Finally, we investigate the scenario of intermittent social distancing and find an optimal social-to-no-distancing duration ratio of 5:1 corresponding to a sustainable reduction in medical demands. Published under license by AIP Publishing. https://doi. Here, we address these concerns by investigating the dynamics of three social distancing strategies-indefinite, finite-duration, and intermittent-on age-stratified US population and benchmark its effectiveness in reducing the burden on hospital beds. We find that a wholesale, indefinite social distancing could balance the demand-to-supply ratios of hospital beds at epidemic peaks provided a 70% reduction in the time-of-exposure of the population within all age groups is achieved. We find that finite-duration social distancing manifests itself into two distinct regimes. For social distancing lasting less than two weeks, a higher reduction in the time-of-exposure of the population results in less hospitalizations. For social distancing lasting longer than two weeks, ∼50% reduction in the time-of-exposure of the population yields the largest reduction in hospitalizations. Greater than this threshold reduction intensity, our analysis shows a large buildup of susceptible individuals, who remain prone to the infection at the end of the social distancing period. Overall, we emphasize the exponentially diminishing medical cost benefits of finite-duration social distancing-a phenomenon characterized by a linear decrease in medical demand achieved against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. We finally investigate intermittent social distancing as a strategy
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	In January 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China. The aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the Sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of the performed interventions. We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. Severity of symptoms increased with age. We estimated R 0 at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6-3.7). The epidemic was self-sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95%CI: 31-68 days), causing 9,216 (95%CI: 1,317-25,545) more cases and possibly overwhelming Sichuan healthcare system.
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	Background: Individual-based models (IBMs) are useful to simulate events subject to stochasticity and/or heterogeneity, and have become well established to model the potential (re)emergence of pathogens (e.g., pandemic influenza, bioterrorism). Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines. Methods: We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening. Results: We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous betweenand within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable. Conclusions: IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within-and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent "branding". Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.

678c6fd1ee7fdf07055bbb00725a7c8526d8015e	Various types of vaccines are under pre-clinical and clinical development to address the recent appearance of Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS, an emerging infectious disease that has already caused over 600 deaths and remains a threat to world health. The causative agent for this respiratory disease is a member of the betacoronavirus genus, phylogenetically closely related to the SARS coronavirus that caused an international health emergency in 2002. With lessons learned from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and with undeniable technological advances, vaccine development against MERS was initially fast-paced and has produced several DNA and protein vaccine candidates with promising results during early pre-clinical testing. At least one vaccine candidate has even entered firstin-humans clinical trials now. With the number of MERS cases declining though and other infectious diseases attracting increased attention, the question remains, whether, similar to the situation after the SARS pandemic, vaccine development is halted or remains the priority it rightfully should.
92fd1816e380b12f3759efc6c34e434e403f3225	A 6-month-old female Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) cub that was severely affected by mange died in September 2016 in the Montes de Toledo (Spain) with crusts and fissures on its face, outer ears, nipples and footpads. The body condition of the cub was very poor, and it also had a mandibular abscess and a severely ankylosed luxation on its left knee. After confirming that the origin of the deceased cub's dermal lesions was Sarcoptes scabiei, the subsequent search for ectoparasites and a comparison of histopathological and immunohistochemical findings in all sympatric lynxes handled (n = 30) and submitted for necropsy (n = 4) during 2016 and 2017 revealed the presence of S. scabiei mites and/or milder mange compatible lesions in five members of her family group, which was treated against mange together with two exposed contiguous family groups. An ELISA developed by the authors showed the presence of antibodies against S. scabiei in the deceased female cub and one brother. The presence of concomitant immunosuppressive factors in the dead female cub and the results obtained for the other sympatric lynxes studied since 2016 suggest that S. scabiei had a limited effect on immune-competent Iberian lynxes in the local population of the Montes de Toledo. However, a different evolution and relevance of sarcoptic mange in different populations-or even in the same one in the presence of immunosuppressive factors-cannot be ruled out, thus confirming the need for further research in order to attain a complete comprehension of the epidemiology and the real threat that this ectoparasitic disease may imply for L. pardinus.
a2cb05adda0e747ced00f9b34732296d28e3a0b5	Background: Previous studies reported detection of influenza RNA in stools of patients with seasonal influenza infection. While this detection may have a clinical significance, other factors may influence the stool positivity for influenza viruses. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate demographical, clinical, and microbiological factors which could favor the presence of influenza viral RNA in the stools of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Methods: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) patients were enrolled by general practitioners (GP) during two winter seasons (2014-2016). Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool specimens, and clinical data were collected. Samples were tested for 12 respiratory pathogen groups (nasopharyngeal and stool specimens) and for 12 enteric pathogens (stool specimens). Results: Among the 331 patients with ARI enrolled by GP, 114 (34.4%) presented influenza infection. Influenza RNA was detected in stool samples of 21% (24/114) of the 114 stool specimens analyzed. Hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.8 (95% confidence interval (CI)) [1.7-33.7], P = .02), age between 45 and 64 years (aOR = 4.8 [1.7-14.5], P = .01), consumption of raw shellfish and/or mollusks (aOR = 16.7 [3.6-90.9], P = .00), and use of antibiotics (aOR = 6.4 [2.1-19.8], P = .006) or antiviral treatment (aOR = 7.4 [1.9-29], P = .01) were significantly associated with an increased odds of the detection of influenza RNA in stools. Among the 24 stool samples subjected to viral isolation, no one showed virus growth. Conclusions: These findings will be useful to studies investigating the dissemination route of influenza viruses to gastrointestinal tract.

0943374130f5f8474d6d480d4d038615a0e36de3	In chronic HCV infection, treatment failure and defective host immune response highly demand improved therapy strategies. Vc9Vd2 T-cells may inhibit HCV replication in vitro through IFN-c release after Phosphoantigen (PhAg) stimulation. The aim of our work was to analyze Vc9Vd2 T-cell functionality during chronic HCV infection, studying the role of IFN-a on their function capability. IFN-c production by Vc9Vd2 T-cells was analyzed in vitro in 24 HCV-infected patients and 35 healthy donors (HD) after PhAg stimulation with or without IFN-a. The effect of in vivo PhAg/IFN-a administration on plasma IFN-c levels was analyzed in M. fascicularis monkeys. A quantitative analysis of IFN-c mRNA level and stability in Vc9Vd2 T-cells was also evaluated. During chronic HCV infection, Vc9Vd2 T-cells showed an effector/activated phenotype and were significantly impaired in IFN-c production. Interestingly, IFN-a was able to improve their IFN-c response to PhAg both in vitro in HD and HCV-infected patients, and in vivo in Macaca fascicularis primates. Finally, IFN-a increased IFN-c-mRNA transcription and stability in PhAg-activated Vc9Vd2 T-cells. Altogether our results show a functional impairment of Vc9Vd2 T-cells during chronic HCV infection that can be partially restored by using IFN-a. A study aimed to evaluate the antiviral impact of PhAg/IFN-a combination may provide new insight in designing possible combined strategies to improve HCV infection treatment outcome.
0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	The 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend countries to establish a national severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) surveillance system for preparedness and emergency response. However, setting up or maintaining a robust SARI surveillance system has been challenging. Similar to other countries, surveillance data on hospitalisations for SARI in the Netherlands are still limited, in contrast to the robust surveillance data in primary care. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview, evaluation, and challenges of already available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands, which might be used for near real-time surveillance of severe respiratory infections. Seven available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands were reviewed. The evaluation criteria, including data quality, timeliness, representativeness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability and stability were based on United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidelines for public health surveillance. We added sustainability as additional evaluation criterion. The best evaluated surveillance system or dataset currently available for SARI surveillance is crude mortality monitoring, although it lacks specificity. In contrast to influenza-like illness (ILI) in primary care, there is currently no gold standard for SARI surveillance in the Netherlands. Based on our experience with sentinel SARI surveillance, a fully or semi-automated, passive surveillance system seems most suited for a sustainable SARI surveillance system. An important future challenge remains integrating SARI surveillance into existing hospital programs in order to make surveillance data valuable for public health, as well as hospital quality of care management and individual patient care.

3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	The current COVID-19 pandemic has urged the scientific community internationally to find answers in terms of therapeutics and vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. Published investigation mostly on SARS-CoV and to extent on MERS has taught lessons to vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus. This is attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances. The COVID-19 pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after Spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted immune-potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this virus. This review is aimed at providing an overview of the efforts dedicated to an effective vaccine for this novel coronavirus which has crippled the world in terms of economy, human health and life.

Human milk IgG originates mainly from blood, therefore a SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibody (Ab) response in milk would be expected (1). However, IgG comprises only ~2% of milk Ab, with most milk Abs originating from mucosa-associated
2620711ca6b696ded3b6a891305daea8cf3a562c	Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was recently identified in The Netherlands and was linked to acute respiratory tract illness. In this study, 11 isolates from 10 patients with respiratory disease from Quebec, Canada, were tested by a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction based on the fusion protein gene. Identified sequences were consistent with HMPV. The patients were 2 months to 87 years of age (median age, 58 years) and presented with acute respiratory tract illness during the winter season. Sequence studies of the nucleocapsid, fusion, and polymerase genes identified 2 main lineages of HMPV and cocirculation of both lineages during the same year. These findings support a previous finding that HMPV is a human respiratory pathogen that merits further study.
8a1c9aac07eb230a840ec6c81fff6c4318a31f07	KEYWORDS Necrotizing enterocolitis Microbiome Intestinal microbiota Noncultured based techniques Sequencing The intestinal microbiota normally exist in a commensal or symbiotic relationship with the host, but in the neonate, and especially in the premature infant, this relationship needs to develop. Alterations of the intestinal microbiota may predispose the preterm infant to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis. Composition and quality of the intestinal microbiota depend on many factors, such as mode of birth, type of feeding, and use of antibiotics. There are many opportunities for physicians to provide interventions that could improve the adequate colonization of the neonatal gut. Culture-based techniques are highly limited, but the development of new molecular technologies to study previously unidentified organisms has enhanced our understanding of the microbial environment that may predispose to necrotizing enterocolitis.
d1d4ae8dd542e752e472532a2509525e22168568	Background: In last three years, 96 suspected poultry farms from different provinces in China were diagnosed for avian infectious bronchitis (IB) survey. Finally, 221 IBV strains were confirmed by dwarf embryo test and RT-PCR assay. By virus recovery trials, 187 of the isolates caused the birds died or distressed from nephritis, which was accordant with the clinical record. Results: Based on epidemiology analysis of recent field isolates of nephropathogenic IB in vaccinated farms in China, YL6 strain were used for vaccination and evaluated by antibody titer and challenge tests. The immunoprotection test indicated that the practical application of vaccine based on the recent field strains could finely facilitate controlling the nephropathogenic IB. Conclusions: Our study was aim at setting a guide for safeguard against nephropathogenic IBV-caused disease in China.
5e77c07596acbf98257f1aa272898f16f2b0ee0e	The embryonated egg is a complex structure comprised of an embryo and its supporting membranes (chorioallantoic, amniotic, yolk). The developing embryo and its membranes provide the diversity of cell types that are needed for successful replication of a wide variety of different viruses. Within the family Coronaviridae the embryonated egg has been used as a host system primarily for two avian coronaviruses within the genus Gammacoronavirus , infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV). The embryonated egg also has been shown to be suitable for isolation and propagation of pheasant coronavirus, a proposed member of the Gammacoronavirus genus. IBV and pheasant coronavirus replicate well in the embryonated chicken egg, regardless of inoculation route; however, the allantoic route is favored as these viruses replicate well in epithelium lining the chorioallantoic membrane, with high virus titers found in these membranes and associated allantoic fl uids. TCoV replicates only in epithelium lining the embryo intestines and bursa of Fabricius, thus amniotic inoculation is required for isolation and propagation of this virus. Embryonated eggs also provide a potential host system for detection and characterization of other, novel coronaviruses.
e01918d946d2e54019fa3192d522aad92b4a1c12	Background: The long-term closing of schools and home-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic cause negative effects on the physical and mental health of young people. Studies evaluating the mental health of adolescents during the pandemic are limited in the literature. Aim: In our study, it was aimed to determine the results of home-quarantine measures taken for adolescents during the pandemic and the affecting factors. Method: This study was conducted as an online cross-sectional self-report questionnaire and included children aged between 12 and 18 years. The data were obtained from the children of volunteer families via Facebook family groups, and Google Forms questionnaires sent by the child psychiatry clinic to their smartphones. Sociodemographic form, State-Trait anxiety scale, and UCLA loneliness survey were used as data collection tools. We examined the data of 745 adolescents. The average age of the study group was 16.83 ± 1.66 years, and 69.5% were females. It was determined that 88.2% of the adolescents followed the developments in the COVID-19 process and obtained most information from the television. State anxiety was related to "Former psychiatric referral" by 4.39-fold, "Having a COVID positive patient in the family or your surroundings" by 3.81-fold, and "The most common medium for obtaining COVID-related information" by 2.41-fold. Conclusions: Closure of schools and home-quarantine during pandemic causes anxiety and loneliness in young people. The identification of risky groups helps to properly support these individuals by various social connections, including healthcare professionals, families, and schools.
ad142e62f592ce97eeda012293c8758d8a2c42ab	Here, we describe a unique probabilistic evaluation of the 20, naturally occurring, amino acids and their distributions within the Swiss-Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases. We have developed a computational technique that imparts both directionality and length constraints into searches for unique combinations of amino acids within protein sequences. Using statistical approaches, we have carried out searches of all possible two-and three-residue motifs contained within these databases. This technique is based on the unusually high occurrence of a small number of these motifs when compared to the expected probability of finding a specific residue grouping within a given database. Subsequent filtering of this search to identify such unique combinations has provided several examples that can be used as markers to identify particular proteins within or across databases. We focus on three of these motifs, which were found to be of greatest interest to us. The CC, CM and a combination of the two, CCM motifs all occur either more or less frequently than would be predicted based on standard amino acid distributions within the entire human proteome. r
a2387cd1b9d2d9eaf641f3e85c815005bba5c6f5	Respiratory syncytical virus Outbreak Haemato-oncology patients Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant respiratory tract infection in immunosuppressed patients. Aim: To describe two consecutive yearly outbreaks of RSV in our haemato-oncology ward. Methods: Haematology patients presenting with respiratory symptoms were screened by polymerase chain reaction for viral respiratory pathogens using a saline gargle. Findings: None of our patients had undergone bone marrow transplant but all had underlying haematological malignancies. Eight patients were affected in the first outbreak (mortality rate: 37.5%) and 12 patients were affected in the second (mortality rate: 8.3%). Extensive infection control measures were implemented in both outbreaks and were successful in preventing further cross-transmission. Conclusion: There was significant learning from both outbreaks and actions implemented with the aim of reducing the likelihood and impact of future outbreaks. Crown
dfa3dbdc7b28b9075361efcb919d3a1b19636edd	Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major viral cause of chronic liver disease, frequently progresses to steatosis and cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection strongly induces host responses, such as the activation of the unfolded protein response, autophagy and the innate immune response. Upon HCV infection, the host induces the interferon (IFN)-mediated frontline defense to limit virus replication. Conversely, HCV employs diverse strategies to escape host innate immune surveillance. Type I IFN elicits its antiviral actions by inducing a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these ISGs participate in IFN-mediated anti-HCV actions remain largely unknown. In this review, we first outline the signaling pathways known to be involved in the production of type I IFN and ISGs and the tactics that HCV uses to subvert innate immunity. Then, we summarize the effector mechanisms of scaffold ISGs known to modulate IFN function in HCV replication. We also highlight the potential functions of emerging ISGs, which were identified from genome-wide siRNA screens, in HCV replication. Finally, we discuss the functions of several cellular determinants critical for regulating host immunity in HCV replication. This review will provide a basis for understanding the complexity and functionality of the pleiotropic IFN system in HCV infection. Elucidation of the specificity and the mode of action of these emerging ISGs will also help to identify novel cellular targets against which effective HCV therapeutics can be developed.
03148d1ba3c986ec7306ab2a90bcd6082c512f49	Bats are recognized reservoirs for many emerging zoonotic viruses of public health importance. Identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin. We characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats, incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species, which were sampled in three locations of Yunnan province, by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and next-generation sequencing. Seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by RT-PCR using degenerate primers, and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera (Rubulavirus, Henipavirus and Jeilongvirus). Various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using Illumina sequencing. A total of 7066 assembled contigs (≥200 bp) were constructed, and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses (of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families, 1 insect virus, and 1 mycovirus), 17 were parasites, and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms. Among the Viruses 2014, 6 2139 103 vertebrate viral contigs, 79 displayed low identity (<70%) to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level, suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses. Overall, the most frequently identified viruses, particularly in bats from the family Hipposideridae, were retroviruses. The present study expands our understanding of the bat virome in species commonly found in Yunnan, China, and provides insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into humans.
398fc759d129a498cc50889607912a34cdc695f8	This study was designed to test the efficacy of an air treatment using ozone and relative humidity (RH) for the inactivation of airborne viruses. Four phages (φX174, PR772, MS2 and φ6) and one eukaryotic virus (murine norovirus MNV-1) were exposed to low ozone concentrations (1.23 ppm for phages and 0.23 ppm for MNV-1) and various levels of RH for 10 to 70 minutes. The inactivation of these viruses was then assessed to determine which of the tested conditions provided the greatest reduction in virus infectivity. An inactivation of at least two orders of magnitude for φX174, MS2 and MNV-1 was achieved with an ozone exposure of 40 minutes at 85% RH. For PR772 and φ6, exposure to the reference condition at 20% RH for 10 minutes yielded the same results. These findings suggest that ozone used at a low concentration is a powerful disinfectant for airborne viruses when combined with a high RH. Air treatment could therefore be implemented inside hospital rooms ventilated naturally.
4a487430085a45904f4463e6e462a63f98adefad	e Abstract-To differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from non-SARS illness, we retrospectively compared 53 patients with probable SARS and 31 patients with non-SARS who were admitted to Mackay Memorial Hospital from April 27 to June 16, 2003. Fever (> 38°C) was the earliest symptom (50/53 SARS vs. 5/31 non-SARS, p < 0.0001), preceding cough by a mean of 4.5 days. The initial chest X-ray study was normal in 22/53 SARS cases versus 5/31 non-SARS cases. SARS patients with an initially normal chest X-ray study developed infiltrates at a mean of 5 ؎ 3.44 days after onset of fever (21/22 SARS vs. 0/5 non-SARS). Rapid radiographic progression of unifocal involvement to multifocal infiltrates was seen in 22 of 24 SARS vs. 0 of 26 non-SARS patients (p < 0.0001). Pleural effusion was not present in any SARS patients but was seen in 6 of 26 non-SARS cases (p < 0.0001). Initial lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were all more common in SARS than non-SARS (p < e Keywords-coronavirus; non-severe acute respiratory syndrome; nasopharyngeal swab; reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; severe acute respiratory syndrome
b86ab2ba48281309909b1b028e11ae3af52aae9a	The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is one of the most common causes of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Wide spectrum of etiologies associated with hyponatremia pose significant challenges in detecting and treating this disorder. Several infectious causes of SIADH have been reported; however, hyponatremia associated with SIADH and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was only recently mentioned in a few case reports. We discuss a unique presentation of COVID-19, in which the patient presented with acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia thought to be the initial and isolated presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
c0141cac942e8c5a718ae908d1a31c6e16dd9b90	Understanding viral transmission dynamics within populations of reservoir hosts can facilitate greater knowledge of the spillover of emerging infectious diseases. While bat-borne viruses are of concern to public health, investigations into their dynamics have been limited by a lack of longitudinal data from individual bats. Here, we examine capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from a species of Australian bat (Myotis macropus) infected with a putative novel Alphacoronavirus within a Bayesian framework. Then, we developed epidemic models to estimate the effect of persistently infectious individuals (which shed viruses for extensive periods) on the probability of viral maintenance within the study population. We found that the CMR data analysis supported grouping of infectious bats into persistently and transiently infectious bats. Maintenance of coronavirus within the study population was more likely in an epidemic model that included both persistently and transiently infectious bats, compared with the epidemic model with non-grouping of bats. These findings, using rare CMR data from longitudinal samples of individual bats, increase our understanding of transmission dynamics of bat viral infectious diseases.
72a62993cea1bea7085844a676df99c5cadcd1fb	 Epidemiological data suggests that the physiological mechanisms underlying highaltitude  acclimatization may provide possible avenues to identify therapeutic targets for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.  Acute mountain sickness (AMS) and SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced infection share striking similarities  Erythropoietin and erythropoietin derivatives should be considered as putative adjuvants in the treatment of COVID-19. A very recent epidemiological study provides preliminary evidence that living in habitats located at 2500 m above sea level and higher might protect from the development of severe respiratory symptoms following infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. This epidemiological finding raises the question of whether physiological mechanisms underlying the acclimatization to high altitude identifies therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome pivotal to the reduction of global mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article compares the symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) with those of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explores overlapping patho-physiological mechanisms of the respiratory system including impaired oxygen transport, pulmonary gas exchange and brainstem circuits controlling respiration. In this context, we also discuss the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on oxygen sensing in the carotid body. Finally, since erythropoietin (EPO) is an effective treatment for AMS, this article reviews the potential benefits of implementing FDA-approved erythropoietinbased (EPO) drug therapies to counteract a variety of acute respiratory and non-respiratory (e.g. excessive inflammation of vascular beds) symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
0480084eefee6333df832a821af8945ea7ab379a	Background: In addition to livestock movements, other between-farm contacts such as visitors may contribute to the spread of contagious animal diseases. Knowledge about such contacts is essential for contingency planning. Preventive measures, risk-based surveillance and contact tracing may be facilitated if the frequency and type of between-farm contacts can be assessed for different types of farms. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and types of visitors on farms with cloven-hoofed animals in Sweden and to analyse whether there were differences in the number of visitors attributable to region, season, and type of herd. Data were collected from Swedish farmers through contact-logs covering two-week periods during four different seasons. Results: In total, 482 (32%) farmers filled in the contact log for at least one period and the data represent 18,416 days. The average number of professional and non-professional visitors per day was 0.3 and 0.8, respectively. Whereas the number of professional visitors seemed to increase with increasing herd size, this relation was not seen for non-professional visits. The mean numbers of visitors per day were highest in the summer and in the farm category 'small mixed farm'. Reports of the visitors' degree of contact with the animals showed that veterinarians, AI-technicians, animal transporters and neighbours were often in direct contact with the animals or entered the stables and 8.8% of the repairmen were also in direct contact with animals, which was unexpected. In a multivariable analysis, species, herd size and season were significantly associated with the number of professional visitors as well as the number of visitors in direct contact with the animals. Conclusion: In conclusion there was a large variation between farms in the number and type of contacts. The number of visitors that may be more likely to spread diseases between farms was associated with animal species and herd size.
32b6ecf50c62b0c312394d6082c1824391f9d994	Objectives: To report epidemiological features, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections in comparison with other community acquired respiratory virus (CRV) infections in patients hospitalized for two consecutive years. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory syndrome in a tertiary care hospital from 2012 to 2013 were reviewed. Results: HRV was the most common CRV observed (36%, 162/444) and was present in the majority of viral co-detections (69%, 88/128), mainly in association with human enterovirus (45%). Most HRV-infected patients were younger than 2 years (57%). Overall, patients infected with HRV had a lower frequency of severe acute respiratory infection than those infected with other CRVs (60% and 84%, respectively, p = 0.006), but had more comorbidities (40% and 27%, respectively; p = 0.043). However, in the adjusted analysis this association was not significant. The mortality rate within the HRV group was 3%. Detection of HRV was more prevalent during autumn and winter, with a moderately negative correlation between viral infection frequency and temperature (r = −0.636, p < 0.001) but no correlation with rainfall (r = −0.036, p = 0.866). ଝ Please cite this article as: Leotte J, Trombetta H, Faggion HZ, Almeida BM, Nogueira MB, Vidal LR, et al. Impact and seasonality of human rhinovirus infection in hospitalized patients for two consecutive years. J Pediatr (Rio J). 2017;93:294---300. 295 Conclusion: HRV is usually detected in hospitalized children with respiratory infections and is often present in viral co-detections. Comorbidities are closely associated with HRV infections. These infections show seasonal variation, with predominance during colder seasons. Rinovírus humano; Infecções respiratórias agudas; Vírus respiratório Objetivos: Relatar as características epidemiológicas, as características clínicas e os resultados das infecções por rinovírus humano (RVH) em comparação a outras infecções por vírus respiratórios adquiridos na comunidade (VRCs) em pacientes internados por dois anos consecutivos. Métodos: Este foi um estudo transversal. Foram revisados os dados clínicos, epidemiológicos e laboratoriais de pacientes internados com síndrome respiratória aguda em um hospital terciário de 2012 a 2013. Resultados: O RVH foi o VRC mais comum observado (36%, 162/444) e esteve presente na maior parte das codetecções virais (69%, 88/128), principalmente em associação ao enterovírus humano (45%). A maioria dos pacientes infectados por RVH possuía menos de 2 anos (57%). De modo geral, os pacientes com RVH apresentaram uma menor frequência de infecção respiratória aguda grave que os pacientes infectados por outros VRCs (60% e 84%, respectivamente, p = 0,006), porém mais comorbidades (40% e 27%, respectivamente; p = 0,043). Contudo, em uma análise ajustada, essa associação não foi significativa. A taxa de mortalidade no grupo RVH foi 3%. A detecção de RVH foi mais prevalente durante o outono e inverno, com uma correlação negativa moderada entre a frequência de infecção viral e a temperatura (r = -0,636, p < 0,001), porém nenhuma correlação com a precipitação (r = -0,036, p = 0,866). Conclusão: O RVH é normalmente detectado em crianças internadas com infecções respiratórias e normalmente está presente em codetecções virais. As comorbidades estão estreitamente associadas a infecções por RVH. Essas infecções mostram variação sazonal, com predominância durante as estações mais frias.
11c30f0bf97793c770906feafcbec414affb73ef	In this study, a dataset of X-ray images from patients with common viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, confirmed Covid-19 disease was utilized for the automatic detection of the Coronavirus disease. The point of the investigation is to assess the exhibition of cutting edge convolutional neural system structures proposed over the ongoing years for clinical picture order. In particular, the system called Transfer Learning was received. With transfer learning, the location of different variations from the norm in little clinical picture datasets is a reachable objective, regularly yielding amazing outcomes. The datasets used in this trial. Firstly, a collection of 24000 X-ray images includes 6000 images for confirmed Covid-19 disease,6000 confirmed common bacterial pneumonia and 6000 images of normal conditions. The information was gathered and expanded from the accessible X-Ray pictures on open clinical stores. The outcomes recommend that Deep Learning with X-Ray imaging may separate noteworthy biological markers identified with the Covid-19 sickness, while the best precision, affectability, and particularity acquired is 97.83%, 96.81%, and 98.56% individually.
22a53ac3500f53ec6ed60eaa718783373e559f98	Background: The transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza and corona viruses from one person to another is still not fully understood. Methods: A literature search showed that there is a strong scientific rationale and evidence that viruses are very efficiently spread through aerosols by the patient's breathing only. It is not necessary for the patient to cough or sneeze. Results: The exhaled aerosol particles are generated by normal breathing in the deep lung through reopening of collapsed small airways during inspiration. These mucus/surfactant aerosols (size range between 0.2 and 0.6 lm) can transport viruses out of the lungs of patients and be present in the room air for hours. Conclusion: These aerosol particles are difficult to filter out of the air; because of their physical properties, new strategies must be developed to protect people from these virus aerosols. a This was determined by various breathing maneuvers. The production of aerosol particles is increased when the test person starts the breathing maneuver with an inhalation after a very deep exhalation and after a pause in breathing after an exhalation, the exhaled aerosol particle concentration decreases.
9d1f0da1d9a67051f6f28aea17448a27dbe69415	Real-time molecular techniques have become the reference methods for direct diagnosis of pathogens. The reduction of steps is a key factor in order to decrease the risk of human errors resulting in invalid series and delayed results. We describe here a process of preparation of oligonucleotide primers and hydrolysis probe in a single tube at predefined optimized concentrations that are stabilized via lyophilization (Lyoph-P&P). Lyoph-P&P was compared versus the classic protocol using extemporaneously prepared liquid reagents using (i) sensitivity study, (ii) long-term stability at 4 • C, and (iii) long-term stability at 37 • C mimicking transportation without cold chain. Two previously published molecular assays were selected for this study. They target two emerging viruses that are listed on the blueprint of the WHO as to be considered for preparedness and response actions: chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV). Results of our study demonstrate that (i) Lyoph-P&P is stable for at least 4 days at 37 • C supporting shipping without the need of cold chain, (ii) Lyoph-P&P rehydrated solution is stable at +4 • C for at least two weeks, (iii) sensitivity observed with Lyoph-P&P is at least equal to, often better than, that observed with liquid formulation, (iv) validation of results observed with low-copy specimens is rendered easier by higher fluorescence level. In conclusion, Lyoph-P&P holds several advantages over extemporaneously preparer liquid formulation that merit to be considered when a novel real-time molecular assay is implemented in a laboratory in charge of routine diagnostic activity.
05aa4c91e60076cc377934efb8072dc82f84b130	To evaluate the clinical performance of 3 molecular assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). : We used 184 nasopharyngeal swab specimens to compare Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 (Abbott ID NOW), DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (DiaSorin Simplexa), and Roche cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (Roche cobas) assays. In a separate analysis, 3 specimens (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and nasal) were collected from 182 unique patients presenting to the emergency department with suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 and were tested utilizing Abbott ID NOW. To further characterize each assay, relative limits of detection were evaluated utilizing positive nasopharyngeal patient samples. Results: The positive percent agreement was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.97) for Abbott ID NOW and 100% (95% CI, 0.90-1.00) for DiaSorin Simplexa and Roche cobas. The negative percent agreement was 100% (95% CI, 0.98-1.00) for all 3 assays. All swab types tested with the Abbott assay produced concordant results. Polymerase chain reaction assays had approximately 10 to 100 times lower limits of detection than Abbott ID NOW. Conclusions: Based on these evaluations, a multiplatform testing approach is proposed, depending on patient population and assay sensitivity, to address testing needs during a public health emergency.
d8eb14ca18661130fdaf099482d6cd5b46032efe	Background: Fibrinogen alpha C chain 5.9 kDa fragment (FIC5.9) is a new serum biomarker for chronic hepatitis that was discovered by proteomics analysis. Previous studies have shown that FIC5.9 is derived from the C-terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain and the serum levels of FIC5.9 decrease in chronic hepatitis. It also have been reported that FIC5.9 cannot be detected in the blood stream of the systemic circulation and it is released from fibrinogen during blood clotting in collecting tube. However, the mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is unclear. We formulated a hypothesis that FIC5.9 is released by enzymes that are activated by post-blood collection and may be coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen in healthy blood. Our analysis showed that thrombin acts as an initiator for FIC5.9 releasing, and that mainly plasmin cleaves N-terminal end of FIC5.9 and neutrophil elastase cleave C-terminal end of FIC5.9. Conclusion: FIC5.9 reflects minute changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis factors and may be associated with pathological conditions. which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

ffea289feac032cd0ba2c8890a9a725c763af652	We highlight in this short article the side-effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the management of non-COVID patients, with potential detrimental and irreversible complications. We thus propose adjusted strategies to deal with both COVID and non-COVID patients.
e5a2d3550cfa6c07e3a376f03ce1cc135f87afe4	The use of probiotics in sows during pregnancy and lactation and their impact on the quality of colostrum and milk, as well as the health conditions of their offspring during the rearing period, are currently gaining the attention of researchers. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of Bokashi formulation on the concentrations of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of sows during pregnancy, in their colostrum and milk, and in a culture of Con-A-stimulated polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) isolated from the colostrum. The study was conducted on 60 sows aged 2-4 years. EM Bokashi were added to the sows' feed. The material for the study consisted of peripheral blood, colostrum, and milk. Blood samples were collected from the sows on days 60 and 114 of gestation. Colostrum and milk samples were collected from all sows at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 h after parturition. The results indicate that the use of Bokashi as feed additives resulted in increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, which increase the protective capacity of the colostrum by stimulating cellular immune mechanisms protecting the sow and neonates against infection. At the same time, the increased concentrations of cytokines IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β, and of immunoglobulins in the colostrum and milk from sows in the experimental group demonstrate the immunoregulatory effect of Bokashi on Th2 cells and may lead to increased expression of regulatory T cells and polarization of the immune response from Th1 to Th2.
432886d87d7adb0270629cc79db01f7ce74f094f	COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world. One of the principle preventive strategies is 11 practicing social distancing. Congregations of the faithful at local and transnational level are 12 strongly recommended by several world religions and religious orders. Gathering of large 13 number of people in close approximation could be a fertile ground for the spread of novel 14 pathogens. The refusal to suspend such gatherings could lead to potential widespread dispersal of 15 infections. 16 17 18 same time. Muslim organizations in Non-Muslim countries also followed suit. Some 87 conservatives in other countries argued for continuing congregational prayers at the mosque. 88 Nevertheless, most of them fell in line, but by that time much damage had been done. 89 A Christian congregation in South Korea was the cause of a large number of COVID-19 cases. 90 After an initial success in limiting the spread, there was a sudden spurt of cases from third week 91 of February 2020, originating from an infected patient attending the Shincheonji Church of 92 Jesus. The Cult believes that illness is a sin and the sufferer must attend prayers to atone for the 93 sin (Park, 2020). This belief motivated its followers to avoid testing and some covertly continued 94 attending the masses. This only augmented the problem. A large number of the cult's followers 95 were tested and 5,209 were found positive till April 8 2020 (Statista 2020). 96 COVID-19 infection rates among the ultra-orthodox Jews of Israel were disproportionately high 97 compared to other Israelis. It is suspected that as many as 40% residents of an ultraorthodox 98 neighborhood could be infected. Besides big families and crowded living, unflinching 99 observations of communal religious prayers are considered as important reasons. The 100 synagogues in this particular neighborhood had massive attendance during the Jewish holiday of 101 Purim on March 9 2020. The community continued its religious gatherings thereafter and refused 102 to suspend them (Tarnopolosk, 2020) 103 In Northwester Indian state of Punjab, a 70 years old Sikh priest after returning from Italy and 104 Germany refused to be self-quarantined. He went on to attend several religious meetings and 105 even visited a Sikh festival at another city that attracts 300,000 people each day. He succumbed 106 to the infection and many of his close contacts tested positive later (Naib, 2020).
b46f553f3346007b177c8af1acc290940fccf35c	Objectives: The aims of this study were to develop a forecasting model for the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and analyze the seasonality of infections in China; and to provide a useful tool for formulating intervention programs and allocating medical resources. Methods: Data for the monthly incidence of TB from January 2004 to December 2015 were obtained from the National Scientific Data Sharing Platform for Population and Health (China). The Box-Jenkins method was applied to fit a seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to forecast the incidence of TB over the subsequent six months. Results: During the study period of 144 months, 12,321,559 TB cases were reported in China, with an average monthly incidence of 6.4426 per 100,000 of the population. The monthly incidence of TB showed a clear 12-month cycle, and a seasonality with two peaks occurring in January and March and a trough in December. The best-fit model was SARIMA (1,0,0)(0,1,1) 12 , which demonstrated adequate information extraction (white noise test, p > 0.05). Based on the analysis, the incidence of TB from January to June 2016 were 6.6335, 4.7208, 5.8193, 5.5474, 5.2202 and 4.9156 per 100,000 of the population, respectively. Conclusions: According to the seasonal pattern of TB incidence in China, the SARIMA model was proposed as a useful tool for monitoring epidemics.
70edcd355ce9191c03ed40085ce73d282cbdfe82	Proteins entering the secretory pathway are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in an unfolded form. In the ER they are restricted to a quality control system that ensures correct folding or eventual degradation of improperly folded polypeptides. Mannose trimming of N-glycans on newly synthesized proteins plays an important role in the recognition and sorting of terminally misfolded glycoproteins for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). In this process misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated into the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and eventually degraded by the proteasome. The mechanism by which misfolded glycoproteins are recognized and recruited to the degradation machinery has been extensively studied during last decade. In this review, we focus on ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) family proteins that seem to play a key role in the discrimination between proteins undergoing a folding process and terminally misfolded proteins directed for degradation. We describe interactions of EDEM proteins with other components of the ERAD machinery, as well as with various protein substrates. Carbohydrate-dependent interactions together with N-glycan-independent interactions seem to regulate the complex process of protein recognition and direction for proteosomal degradation.
4f25524666b603667fae658c2b12cdd4fea8fbb8	Objective To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 epidemic on paediatric emergency department (ED) attendance in a region of Northern Italy. Methods A survey was proposed to six out of nine paediatric EDs in the Emilia Romagna region to evaluate attendance data, distribution by age and gender, triage code score, outcome of clinical course, number of hospitalisations and the distribution of patients by disease. Data were collected during March 2020 and compared with that of March 2019.
4339e9d5025944bdf97238092b27d9d4f8f29429	Most of the SARS-CoV-infected patients spontaneously recovered without clinical intervention while a small percentage succumbed to the disease. Here, we characterized temporal changes in N protein-specific and S glycoprotein-specific neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses in infected patients who have either recovered from or succumbed to SARS-CoV infection. Recovered patients were found to have higher and sustainable levels of both N protein-specific and S glycoprotein-specific Nab responses, suggesting that antibody responses likely play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS-CoV-infected patients.
bbfc4b79333018c0135f55544f7fddd5b8f1018a	Background: Oxygen exists in two gaseous and six solid allotropic modifications. An additional allotropic modification of oxygen, the cyclooctaoxygen, was predicted to exist in 1990. Methods: Cyclooctaoxygen sodium was synthesized in vitro from atmospheric oxygen, or catalase effectgenerated oxygen, under catalysis of cytosine nucleosides and either ninhydrin or eukaryotic low-molecular weight RNA. Thin-layer chromatographic mobility shift assays were applied on specific nucleic acids and the cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex. Results: We report the first synthesis and characterization of cyclooctaoxygen as its sodium crown complex, isolated in the form of three cytosine nucleoside hydrochloride complexes. The cationic cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is shown to bind to nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), to associate with single-stranded DNA and spermine phosphate, and to be essentially non-toxic to cultured mammalian cells at 0.1-1.0 mM concentration. Conclusions: We postulate that cyclooctaoxygen is formed in most eukaryotic cells in vivo from dihydrogen peroxide in a catalase reaction catalyzed by cytidine and RNA. A molecular biological model is deduced for a first epigenetic shell of eukaryotic in vivo DNA. This model incorporates an epigenetic explanation for the interactions of the essential micronutrient selenium (as selenite) with eukaryotic in vivo DNA. General significance: Since the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is calculated to cover the active regions (2.6%) of bovine lymphocyte interphase genome, and 12.4% of murine enterocyte mitotic chromatin, we propose that the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex coverage of nucleic acids is essential to eukaryotic gene regulation and promoted proto-eukaryotic evolution.
c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0	Concern from the public is growing regarding early cow-calf separation, yet proponents of this practice maintain that artificial rearing is critical for cow and calf health. Early separation is assumed to reduce the risk of transfer of pathogens from dam to neonatal calf, but a wide range of health benefits associated with extended cow-calf contact has also been documented. The aim of this systematic review was to report and synthesize conclusions from the literature on dairy cow and calf health in conventional rearing versus cow-calf contact systems. Peer-reviewed, published manuscripts, written in English, directly comparing dairy cow or calf health in artificial versus suckling systems, were eligible for inclusion. We conducted 7 targeted searches using Web of Science to identify key literature on important health conditions. The resulting manuscripts underwent a 4-step appraisal process, and further manuscripts were sourced from reference lists. This process resulted in a final sample of 70 articles that addressed cow and calf health. Sufficient literature was available to assess mastitis in cows, and scours, cryptosporidiosis, Johne's disease, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality in calves. The results for cryptosporidiosis, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality were mixed, with some differences between studies likely attributable to flawed comparisons between cohorts. Overall, the articles addressing calf scours and mastitis pointed to beneficial or no effects of suckling. The studies addressing Johne's disease did not find cow-calf contact to be a significant risk factor. In conclusion, the scientific peer-reviewed literature on cow and calf health provides no consistent evidence in support of early separation.
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in serum protein levels in the progression of hepatitis B using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis, in addition to comparing the serum protein levels of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), patients with hepatitis B virus-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-induced ACLF) and normal individuals. Protein analysis was performed on 15 serum samples using iTRAQ. The study population included healthy controls (n=5), patients with CHB (n=5) and patients with HBV-induced ACLF (n=5). Western blotting was used to verify the results in an additional nine serum samples from healthy controls, patients with CHB and patients with HBV-induced ACLF (n=3, respectively). Using iTRAQ analysis, 16 different serum proteins with ≥1.5-fold differences in expression levels were identified in the patients with CHB and ACLF compared with the healthy controls. Five of those proteins, C-reactive protein precursor, hemoglobin β chain variant Hb S-Wake, apolipoprotein J precursor, platelet factor 4 precursor and vitronectin, which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases, were subsequently verified using western blotting. The western blotting results were consistent with the results from the iTRAQ. Two of the five proteins are not classified by biological process, and the biological functions of all the proteins in HBV-induced ACLF remain unclear. This preliminary study demonstrated that a correlation between the expression of various serum proteins and the different pathogenetic conditions induced by HBV may exist. The analysis of a larger number of samples is required to identify potential protein biomarkers that may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of hepatitis B.
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	Zika virus (ZIKV) has received widespread attention because of its effect on the developing fetus. It is becoming apparent, however, that severe neurological sequelae, such as Guillian-Barrë syndrome (GBS), myelitis, encephalitis, and seizures can occur after infection of adults. This study demonstrates that a contemporary strain of ZIKV can widely infect astrocytes and neurons in the brain and spinal cord of adult, interferon α/β receptor knockout mice (AG129 strain) and cause progressive hindlimb paralysis, as well as severe seizurelike activity during the acute phase of disease. The severity of hindlimb motor deficits correlated with increased numbers of ZIKV-infected lumbosacral spinal motor neurons and decreased numbers of spinal motor neurons. Electrophysiological compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in response to stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord were reduced when obvious motor deficits were present. ZIKV immunoreactivity was high, intense, and obvious in tissue sections of the brain and spinal cord. Infection in the brain and spinal cord was also associated with astrogliosis as well as T cell and neutrophil infiltration. CMAP and histological analysis indicated that peripheral nerve and muscle func-tions were intact. Consequently, motor deficits in these circumstances appear to be primarily due to myelitis and possibly encephalitis as opposed to a peripheral neuropathy or a GBS-like syndrome. Thus, acute ZIKV infection of adult AG129 mice may be a useful model for ZIKV-induced myelitis, encephalitis, and seizure activity.
f2ae2405ecb14e7d58087a201c46881a8eef6e92	Apart from direct detection of the infecting organisms or biomarker of the pathogen itself, surrogate host markers are also useful for sensitive and early diagnosis of pathogenic infections. Early detection of pathogenic infections, discrimination among closely related diseases with overlapping clinical manifestations, and monitoring of disease progression can be achieved by analyzing blood biomarkers. Therefore, over the last decade large numbers of proteomics studies have been conducted to identify differentially expressed human serum/plasma proteins in different infectious diseases with the intent of discovering novel potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. However, in-depth review of the literature indicates that many reported biomarkers are altered in the same way in multiple infectious diseases, regardless of the type of infection. This might be a consequence of generic acute phase reactions, while the uniquely modulated candidates in different pathogenic infections could be indicators of some specific responses. In this review article, we will provide a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed serum/plasma proteins in various infectious diseases and categorize the protein markers associated with generic or specific responses. The challenges associated with the discovery, validation, and translational phases of serum/plasma biomarker establishment are also discussed.

f21707bfddf373f108637c11b489aeac057f29ab	Unsupervised feature selection is an important task in machine learning applications, yet challenging due to the unavailability of class labels. Although a few unsupervised methods take advantage of external sources of correlations within feature groups in feature selection, they are limited to genomic data, and suffer poor accuracy because they ignore input data or encourage features from the same group. We propose a framework which facilitates unsupervised filter feature selection methods to exploit input data and feature group information simultaneously, encouraging features from different groups. We use this framework to incorporate feature group information into Laplace Score algorithm. Our method achieves high accuracy compared to other popular unsupervised feature selection methods (∼30% maximum improvement of Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)) with low computational costs (∼50 times lower than embedded methods on average). It has many real world applications, particularly the ones that use image, text and genomic data, whose features demonstrate strong group structures.
dc16bda747bf057fc2d5f0a433dc709f369e6720	Programmed frameshifting is a recoding event in which a ribosome shifts reading frame by one or more nucleotides at a specific mRNA signal between overlapping genes. Programmed frameshifting is involved in the expression of many genes in a wide range of organisms, especially in viruses and bacteria. The mechanism of programmed frameshifting is not fully understood despite many studies, and there are few databases available for detailed information on programmed frameshifting. We have developed a database called FSDB (Frameshift Signal Database), which is a comprehensive compilation of experimentally known or computationally predicted data about programmed ribosomal frameshifting. FSDB provides a graphical view of frameshift signals and the genes using programmed frameshifting for their expression. It also allows the user himself/herself to find programmed frameshift sites in genomic sequences using a program called FSFinder (http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/fsfinder2). We believe FSDB will be a valuable resource for scientists studying programmed ribosomal frameshifting. FSDB is freely accessible at http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/fsdb/.

ad38b0d5f22eba768ccf58c7f244fcf3528cebfb	The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic challenges public health systems around the world. Tropical countries will face complex epidemiological scenarios involving the simultaneous transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti. The occurrence of arboviral diseases with COVID-19 in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region presents challenges and opportunities for strengthening health services, surveillance and control programs. Financing of training, equipment and reconversion of hospital spaces will have a negative effect on already the limited resource directed to the health sector. The strengthening of the diagnostic infrastructure reappears as an opportunity for the national reference laboratories. Sharing of epidemiological information for the modeling of epidemiological scenarios allows collaboration between health, academic and scientific institutions. The fear of contagion by COVID-19 is constraining people with arboviral diseases to search for care which can lead to an increase in serious cases and could disrupt the operation of vector-control programs due to the reluctance of residents to open their doors to health personnel. Promoting intense community participation along with the incorporation of long lasting innovations in vector control offers new opportunities for control. The COVID-19 pandemic offers challenges and opportunities that must provoke positive behavioral changes and encourage more permanent self-care actions.
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	The aim of our work was to better understand misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 and to study the impact of these errors in epidemic curves. We examined publically available time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3/28/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3/31/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves, a task for which the Bayesian method we presented is well-suited.
00249bd5965a3cde520cdd0def48509c67ecf865	Cancer, which involves the dysregulation of genes via multiple mechanisms, is unlikely to be fully explained by a single data type. By combining different "omes", researchers can increase the discovery of novel bio-molecular associations with disease-related phenotypes. Investigation of functional relations among genes associated with the same disease condition may further help to develop more accurate disease-relevant prediction models. In this work, we present an integrative framework called Data & Analytic Integrator (DAI), to explore the relationship between different omics via different mathematical formulations and algorithms. In particular, we investigate the combinatorial use of molecular knowledge identified from omics integration methods netDx, iDRW and SSL, by fusing the derived aggregated similarity matrices and by exploiting these in a semi-supervised learner. The analysis workflows were applied to real-life data for ovarian cancer and underlined the benefits of joint data and analytic integration.
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	As the recent COVID-19 outbreak rapidly expands all over the world, various containment measures have been carried out to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In Mainland China, the containment measures consist of three types, i.e., Wuhan travel ban, intra-city quarantine and isolation, and inter-city travel restriction. In order to carry out the measures, local economy and information acquisition play an important role. In this paper, we investigate the correlation of local economy and the information acquisition on the execution of containment measures to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Mainland China. First, we use a parsimonious model, i.e., SIR-X model, to estimate the parameters, which represent the execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation in major cities of Mainland China. In order to understand the execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation, we analyze the correlation between the representative parameters including local economy, mobility, and information acquisition. To this end, we collect the data of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the inflows from Wuhan and outflows, and the COVID-19 related search frequency from a widely-used Web mapping service, i.e., Baidu Maps, and Web search engine, i.e., Baidu Search Engine, in Mainland China. Based on the analysis, we confirm the strong correlation between the local economy and the execution of information acquisition in major cities of Mainland China. We further evidence that, although the cities with high GDP per capita attracts bigger inflows from Wuhan, people are more likely to conduct the quarantine measure and to reduce going out to other cities. Finally, the correlation analysis using search data shows that well-informed individuals are likely to carry out containment measures.
2a400cee98d73922da7bcfa0029fc85b89fa2777	Assessing prospects for future oil prices is an uncertain activity but, barring Middle East conflict creating severe supply issues, crude oil prices are expected to stage a recovery by third-quarter 2020 and modest further recovery in first-half 2021, with the range $40 to $60 per barrel for WTI and Brent. Despite such a recovery there will be many oil sectors incurring losses, from US shale oil and Canadian tar sands producers, to many standard crude oil exporters incurring problems with production equipment access and costs, or experiencing lack of competitiveness in key markets.
19a19dcc5b8207923d9b5d33790588bfd1eaf47a	An rare pandemic of viral pneumonia occurs in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which is now recognized internationally as Corona Virus Disease 2019 , the etiological agent classified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it has so far expanded to more than 213 countries/territories worldwide. Our study aims to find the viral peptides of SARS-COV-2 by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) in order to predict its novel structure and find an inhibitor for each viral peptide. For this reason, we calculated the mass of amino acid sequences translated from the SARS-CoV2 whole genome and identify the peptides that may be a target for inhibition. Molecular peptide docking with Moringa oleifera, phytochemicals (aqueous and ethanolic) leaf extracts of flavonoids (3.56 ± 0.03), (3.83 ± 0.02), anthraquinone (11.68 ± 0.04), (10.86 ± 0.06) and hydroxychloroquine present therapy of COVID-19 in Pakistan for comparative study. Results indicate that 15 peptides of SARS-CoV2 have been identified from PMF, which is then used as a selective inhibitor. The maximum energy obtained from AutoDock Vina for hydroxychloroquine is -5.1 kcal/mol, kaempferol (flavonoid) is -6.2 kcal/mol, and for anthraquinone -6 kcal/ mol. Visualization of docking complex, important effects are observed regarding the binding of peptides to drug compounds. In conclusion, it is proposed that these compounds are effective antiviral agents against COVID-19 and can be used in clinical trials. ARTICLE HISTORY
5d44c15017651c74f2134ee0882062e8d7efb4b1	Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) along with the downstream stimulator of interferon genes (STING) acting as essential immunesurveillance mediators have become hot topics of research. The intrinsic function of the cGAS-STING pathway facilitates type-I interferon (IFN) inflammatory signaling responses and other cellular processes such as autophagy, cell survival, senescence. cGAS-STING pathway interplays with other innate immune pathways, by which it participates in regulating infection, inflammatory disease, and cancer. The therapeutic approaches targeting this pathway show promise for future translation into clinical applications. Here, we present a review of the important previous works and recent advances regarding the cGAS-STING pathway, and provide a comprehensive understanding of the modulatory pattern of the cGAS-STING pathway under multifarious pathologic states.
013e6a43d4515dbb6c6eec44918cad6cd8dc7d19	A number of countries are planning the use of "immunity passports" as a way to ease restrictive measures and allow infected and recovered people to return to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper brings together key scientific uncertainties regarding the use of serological tests to assure immune status and a public health ethics perspective to inform key considerations in the ethical implementation of immunity passport policies. Ill-conceived policies have the potential to cause severe unintended harms that could result in greater inequity, the stigmatization of certain sectors of society, and heightened risks and unequal treatment of individuals due to erroneous test results. Immunity passports could, however, be used to achieve collective benefits and benefits for specific populations besides facilitating economic recovery. We conclude that sector-based policies that prioritize access to testing based on societal need are likely to be fairer and logistically more feasible, while minimizing stigma and reducing incentives for fraud. Clear guidelines need to be set out for which sectors of society should be prioritized for testing, and rigorous mechanisms should be in place to validate test results and identify cases of reinfection.
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	Introduction: Bleeding is the most frequent complication in patients receiving venoarterial or venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been used in these patients with conflicting results. We describe our experience with rFVIIa for refractory bleeding in this setting and review the cases reported in the literature. Methods: Clinical characteristics, demographics, bleeding, thrombotic complications, mortality, and rFVIIa administration were retrospectively collected for analysis from the electronic charts of the 15 patients in our intensive care unit who received rFVIIa while being given ECMO from Results: Fifteen patients received rFVIIa for persistent bleeding under venoarterial (n = 11) or venovenous (n = 4) ECMO. Bleeding dramatically decreased in 14 patients, without a major thrombotic event, except in one patient in whom a major stroke could not be ruled out. Two circuits were changed within the 48 hours after rFVIIa administration for clots in the membrane and decreased oxygenation but without massive clotting. The mortality rate was 60%. Conclusions: rFVIIa use for intractable hemorrhaging in patients receiving ECMO controlled bleeding, without major thrombotic events, and with 60% dying. Hence, its use warrants discussion, and clinicians should be aware of the possibility of potentially life-threatening systemic thrombosis, emboli, or circuit clotting. Whether rFVIIa can save the lives of such patients remains to be determined.
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	Background: There are no known medicines or vaccines to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV). Antiviral peptides are superior to conventional drugs and may also be effective against COVID-19. Hence, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (nCoV-RBD) that interacts with hACE2 for viral attachment and entry. Methods: Three strategies and bioinformatics approaches were employed to design potential nCoV-RBD -hACE2 interaction-blocking peptides that may restrict viral attachment and entry. Firstly, the key residues interacting with nCoV-RBD -hACE2 are identified and hACE2 sequence-based peptides are designed. Second, peptides from five antibacterial peptide databases that block nCoV-RBD are identified; finally, a chimeric peptide design approach is used to design peptides that can bind to key nCoV-RBD residues. The final peptides are selected based on their physiochemical properties, numbers and positions of key residues binding, binding energy, and antiviral properties. Results: We found that: (i) three amino acid stretches in hACE2 interact with nCoV-RBD; (ii) effective peptides must bind to three key positions of nCoV-RBD (Gly485/Phe486/Asn487, Gln493, and Gln498/Thr500/Asn501); (iii) Phe486, Gln493, and Asn501 are critical residues; (iv) AC20 and AC23 derived from hACE2 may block two key critical positions; (iv) DBP6 identified from databases can block the three sites of the nCoV-RBD and interacts with one critical position, Gln498; (v) seven chimeric peptides were considered promising, among which cnCoVP-3, cnCoVP-4, and cnCoVP-7 are the top three; and (vi) cnCoVP-4 meets all the criteria and is the best peptide. Conclusions: To conclude, using three different bioinformatics approaches, we identified 17 peptides that can potentially bind to the nCoV-RBD that interacts with hACE2. Binding these peptides to nCoV-RBD may potentially inhibit the virus to access hACE2 and thereby may prevent the infection. Out of 17, 10 peptides have promising potential and need further experimental validation. PubMed Abstract | Publisher Full Text | Free Full Text 2.

21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	Users play a critical role in the creation and propagation of fake news online by consuming and sharing articles with inaccurate information either intentionally or unintentionally. Fake news are written in a way to confuse readers and therefore understanding which articles contain fabricated information is very challenging for non-experts. Given the difficulty of the task, several fact checking websites have been developed to raise awareness about which articles contain fabricated information. As a result of those platforms, several users are interested to share posts that cite evidence with the aim to refute fake news and warn other users. These users are known as fact checkers. However, there are users who tend to share false information, who can be characterised as potential fake news spreaders. In this paper, we propose the CheckerOrSpreader model that can classify a user as a potential fact checker or a potential fake news spreader. Our model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and combines word embeddings with features that represent users' personality traits and linguistic patterns used in their tweets. Experimental results show that leveraging linguistic patterns and personality traits can improve the performance in differentiating between checkers and spreaders.
085e1ec703d9c3dbecc8215da79b187530db1cfc	SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe disease for which currently no specific therapy is available. The use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial and its mode of action poorly understood. We demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level and is accompanied by profound changes in the cellular lipidome as well as reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Trained immunity comprises a functional adaptation induced by epigenetic reprogramming which facilitates the anti-viral innate immune response. Our findings therefore suggest that hydroxychloroquine may not have a beneficial effect on the anti-viral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

8f4394df7ac3ad73f0bd696f98d45ba6c04a44d7	This review summarizes recent experimental achievements in the area of the development of new RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics for the treatment of viral respiratory diseases. Delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) to their intended target tissue remains the biggest problem for most therapeutic applications of these compounds. Appropriate formulations and chemical modifications for improved stability will boost the probability of utilization of RNAi drugs in the clinical applications.
bbb91f2052b3c4e9816269336c38dc857f527b5d	Objective To assess the effects of earlier vs. later re-initiation of enteral feeds after necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Study design We reviewed the literature to assess timing of enteral feeding after NEC using fixed effects models. Results Three studies met inclusion criteria; no randomized trials. After removal of Bell's Stage I infants, the earlier refeeding group (<5-7 or median 4 days) included 79 infants and later refeeding group (≥5-7 or median 10 days) included 119 infants. Pooled analysis revealed earlier re-initiation reduced the incidence in the composite outcome of recurrent NEC and/or post-NEC stricture (OR = 0.27; 95% Cl = 0.10-0.75; p = 0.012). Individually, NEC recurrence (pooled OR = 0.34; 95% Cl = 0.09-1.29; p = 0.112) or stricture (OR = 0.34; 95% Cl = 0.09-1.26; p = 1.06) did not differ between groups. Conclusions There was no increase in negative outcomes with earlier refeeding after NEC. Earlier initiation of enteral feeds resulted in a significantly lower risk for the combined outcome of recurrent NEC and/or post-NEC stricture.
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	Traffic junctions are one of the crowded places where commuters are at high risk of developing respiratory infections, due to their greater exposure to airborne and human transmitted microbial pathogens. An airborne bioaerosol assessment study was carried out at a high traffic density junction focusing on their concentration, contribution in respirable particulate matter (PM), and factors influencing the distribution and microbial diversity. Andersen six-stage viable cascade impactor and a wide-range aerosol spectrometer were used for microbial and particulate matter measurements, respectively. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between bioaerosol concentration, vehicular count, PM concentration, and meteorological parameters. The mean bacteria concentration (1962.95 ± 651.85 CFU/m 3 ) was significantly different than fungi (1118.95 ± 428.34 CFU/m 3 ) (p < 0.05). The temporal distribution showed maximum concentration for bacteria and fungi during monsoon and postmonsoon seasons, respectively. In terms of bioaerosol loading, a considerable fraction of fungi (3.25%) and bacteria (5.65%) contributed to the total airborne PM. Most abundant bioaerosols were Aspergillus (27.58%), Penicillium (23%), and Cladosporium (14.05%) (fungi), and Micrococcus (25.73%), Staphylococcus (17.98%), and Bacillus (13.8%) (bacteria). Trafficinduced roadside soil resuspension and microbial aerosolizations from the human body were identified as the chief sources of bioaerosol emissions. The risk of lower respiratory tract infections caused by anthroponotic (human transmitted) transfer of bacterial pathogens is very high. The results of the study can be used to trace sources of microbial mediated communicable diseases, and to recommend appropriate safety measures to avoid pathogenic bioaerosol exposure.
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) triggers various pathologies in several mouse strains, including hypergammaglobulinaemia, hepatitis and thymus involution. We reported previously the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver and kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in sera from mice infected with MHV-A59. Long-term MHV-infected mice represented a good model of non-pathogenic autoimmune response since the animals were apparently healthy in spite of the presence of autoAb. The aim of this work was to see whether a severe liver injury, which releases endogenous adjuvants, i.e. danger signals, could elicit a broader spectrum of autoAb and perhaps signs of autoimmune hepatitis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) was injected into mice 30 days after MHV infection, and serum was assayed for autoAb and total IgG 20 days later. The association of MHV infection with the toxic effects of CCl 4 resulted in hypergammaglobulinaemia and the production of autoAb to various liver and kidney proteins. Histological examination of liver samples showed tissue damages but without significant differences between the animals submitted to MHV + CCl 4 and controls, which were either infected by MHV without CCl 4 , or poisoned by CCl 4 in the absence of MHV infection. Those results show that liver injury after viral infection may lead to the spreading of the immune response and to an increase of serum IgG, suggesting that the procedure used herein could simulate the onset of autoimmune hepatitis.

The ordinary and partial differential equations describing the physics of these processes with high fidelity are presented, as well as appropriate numerical schemes to solve them. Several examples taken from recent evaluations of the built environment are shown, as well as the optimal placement of sensors.
6b80c9445423f4e8ea6e1898dedccf12aaae4d40	The development of blockchain technologies has enabled the trustless execution of so-called smart contracts, i.e. programs that regulate the exchange of assets (e.g., cryptocurrency) between users. In a decentralized blockchain, the state of smart contracts is collaboratively maintained by a peer-to-peer network of mutually untrusted nodes, which collect from users a set of transactions (representing the required actions on contracts), and execute them in some order. Once this sequence of transactions is appended to the blockchain, the other nodes validate it, re-executing the transactions in the same order. The serial execution of transactions does not take advantage of the multi-core architecture of modern processors, so contributing to limit the throughput. In this paper we propose a true concurrent model of smart contracts execution. Based on this, we show how static analysis of smart contracts can be exploited to parallelize the execution of transactions.
6f063ff8f30e637566e1712adf359aa305aec94f	Job crafting is beneficial for employees and organizations. To better predict these behaviors, we introduce the concept of job crafting self-efficacy (JCSE) and define it as an individual's beliefs about their capability to modify the demands and resources of their job to better fit their needs. This article describes the development and validation of a scale to measure JCSE. We conducted a qualitative study to design and four quantitative studies to test the psychometric properties of this scale among Polish and American employees in both paperand-pencil and online versions. Three independent (N 1 = 364; N 2 = 432; N 3 = 403) confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated a good fit to a 3-factor solution comprising JCSE beliefs about increasing (a) structural job resources, (b) social job resources, and (c) challenging job demands. The 9-item JCSE Scale had good internal consistency, high time stability, and good validity. It correlated positively with general self-efficacy. JCSE explained unique variance in job crafting behaviors over and above general self-efficacy, and was more important in predicting job crafting than contextual factors. We demonstrate the role of social cognitions in shaping job redesign behaviors and provide a useful tool to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions dedicated to empowering JCSE.
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	Motivated by the need for novel robust approaches to modelling the Covid-19 epidemic, this paper treats a population of N individuals as an inhomogeneous random social network (IRSN). The nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships. An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on day 0 by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is given for the basic SI ("susceptible-infective") network contagion model, which focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main result is an analytical formula valid in the large N limit for the state of the system on day t in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network models, including "removed" (R) and "exposed" (E) classes, are formulated. These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic modelling.
0858de1e6677b909c2b50025bdfefa485c253388	COVID-19 has given rise to malicious content online, including online abuse and hate toward British MPs. In order to understand and contextualise the level of abuse MPs receive, we consider how ministers use social media to communicate about the crisis, and the citizen engagement that this generates. The focus of the paper is on a large-scale, mixed methods study of abusive and antagonistic responses to UK politicians during the pandemic from early February to late May 2020. We find that pressing subjects such as financial concerns attract high levels of engagement, but not necessarily abusive dialogue. Rather, criticising authorities appears to attract higher levels of abuse. In particular, those who carry the flame for subjects like racism and inequality, may be accused of virtue signalling or receive higher abuse levels due to the topics they are required by their role to address. This work contributes to the wider understanding of abusive language online, in particular that which is directed at public officials.
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to show that 2009 H1N1 "swine" influenza pandemic vaccination policies deviated from predictions established in the theory of political survival, and to propose that pandemic response deviated because it was ruled by bureaucratized experts rather than by elected politicians. Design/methodology/approach -Focussing on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the paper employs descriptive statistical analysis of vaccination policies in nine western democracies. To probe the plausibility of the novel explanation, it uses quantitative and qualitative content analyses of media attention and coverage in two deviant cases, the USA and Denmark. Findings -Theories linking political survival to disaster responses find little empirical support in the substantial cross-country variations of vaccination responses during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Rather than following a political logic, the case studies of media coverage in the USA and Denmark demonstrate that the response was bureaucratized in the public health agencies (CDC and DMHA, respectively). Hence, while natural disaster responses appear to follow a political logic, the response to pandemics appears to be more strongly instituted in the hands of bureaucratic experts. Research limitations/implications -There is an added value of encompassing bureaucratic dynamics in political theories of disaster response; bureaucratized expertise proved to constitute a strong plausible explanation of the 2009 pandemic vaccination response. Practical implications -Pandemic preparedness and response depends critically on understanding the lessons of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic; a key lesson supported by this paper is that expert-based agencies rather than political leaders are the pivotal actors. Originality/value -This paper is the first to pinpoint the limitations of political survival theories of disaster responses with respect to the 2009 pandemic. Further, it is among the few to analyze the causes of variations in cross-country pandemic vaccination policies during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

There is currently no licensed antiviral treatment available to prevent human CoV infection. The widespread clinical use and existing knowledge on antiviral mechanisms of remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of previous epidemic diseases, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), may be helpful in the combat with novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent clinical evidence didn't confirm the beneficial role of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients and their use was reassessed. We provide an overview of the current evidence into the mechanisms of action of these available drugs which are repurposed for treatment of the new virus. Available data identifies remdesivir as an adenosine analogue that can target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and block viral RNA synthesis. It has been a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses. 3CLpro is a major CoV protease that cleaves the large replicase polyproteins during viral replication and can be targeted by the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir but the clinical effects are controversial. Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine could impair the replication of SARSCoV-2 by multiple mechanisms and their immunomodulatory properties could ameliorate clinical manifestations that are mediated by immune reactions of the host although its beneficial effects are under question and need to be proven at the clinical level. Existing in vitro and in vivo evidence delineate the molecular mechanisms of these drugs in CoV-infected cells. Numerous studies demonstrated the ability of remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication but future research would be needed to understand the exact mode of action of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and to use this knowledge in the treatment of the current COVID-19.
eb0fb44015f899d2b00fc41e9e65ea13fc7fcde1	The main purpose of this study was to investigate how climate change affects blood vessel-related heart disease and hypertension and to estimate the associated economic damage. In this paper, both the panel data model and the contingent valuation method (CVM) approaches are applied. The empirical results indicate that the number of death from cardiovascular diseases would be increased by 0.226% as the variation in temperature increases by 1%. More importantly, the number of death from cardiovascular diseases would be increased by 1.2% to 4.1% under alternative IPCC climate change scenarios. The results from the CVM approach show that each person would be willing to pay US$51 to US$97 per year in order to avoid the increase in the mortality rate of cardiovascular diseases caused by climate change.
3dbe0bf40117cd7538246e63c3536bd652f60752	Protecting Health Care Workers (HCWs) during routine care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients is of paramount importance to halt the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2) pandemic. The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19. However, wearing N95 respirators can prevent 73 more (95% CI 46-91) clinical respiratory infections per 1000 HCWs compared to surgical masks (2 RCTs; 2594 patients; low quality of evidence). A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR= 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections. This finding should be contemplated to decide the best strategy to support the resilience of healthcare systems facing the potentially catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
b4db11ef895a9b39990f3b969f7ee8e9c4588ead	Background: Little is known about antiviral responses in the sinonasal mucosal tissue of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Objective: we investigated the presence of virus and the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in healthy mucosal tissue of control subjects and the inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of CRS patients, and evaluated whether levels of interferons and ISGs might be affected by CRS-related cytokines and by treatment with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists. Methods: The presence of virus in the sinonasal mucosa was evaluated with real-time PCR. The expression of interferons and ISGs in the sinonasal mucosa and in cultured epithelial cells treated with T H 1 and T H 2 cytokines, macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists were evaluated with real-time PCR and Western blotting. The expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in the sinonasal mucosa were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Results: Respiratory viruses were detected in 15% of samples. Interferons and ISGs are expressed in normal mucosa, but their levels were decreased in patients with CRS. Interferon and ISG levels were upregulated in cells treated with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 agonist, but some were decreased in cytokine-treated cells. TLR3 and TLR7 levels showed no significant difference between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. Conclusion: These results suggest that decreased levels of interferons and ISGs in patients with CRS might contribute to impairment of the antiviral innate response in inflammatory sinonasal epithelial cells. Macrolides and glucocorticoids might provide positive effects on the treatment of CRS by upregulating interferon and ISG expression. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2019;144:1551-65.)
fb22b8de70f66a7dc630e9812f783329dac920ea	An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus has been reported worldwide and become a global health problem; hence, the diagnosis and differentiation of this virus from other types of coronavirus is essential to control of the disease. To this end, the analysis of genomics data plays a vital role in introducing a stronger target and consequently provides better results in laboratory examinations. The modified comparative genomics approach helps us to find novel specific targets by comparing two or more sequences on the nucleotide Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 collection database. We, for the first time, detected ORF8 gene as a potential target for the detection of the novel coronavirus. Unlike previous reported genes (RdRP, E and N genes), ORF8 is entirely specific to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and has no cross-reactivity with other kinds of coronavirus. Accordingly, ORF8 gene can be used as an additional confirmatory assay.
ffcfdf9b1ba722f4bfff8c71c65c93b0b64981a0	Single particle cryo-EM is a powerful method for studying proteins and other biological macromolecules. Many of these molecules comprise regions with varying structural properties including disorder, flexibility, and partial occupancy. These traits make computational 3D reconstruction from 2D images challenging. Detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs, used to keep membrane proteins in solution, are common examples of locally disordered structures that can negatively affect existing iterative refinement algorithms which assume rigidity (or spatial uniformity). We introduce a cross-validation approach to derive non-uniform refinement, an algorithm that automatically regularizes 3D density maps during iterative refinement to account for spatial variability, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality. We find that in common iterative refinement methods, regularization using spatially uniform filtering operations can simultaneously over-and under-regularize local regions of a 3D map. In contrast, non-uniform refinement removes noise in disordered regions while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images. Our results include state-of-the-art resolution 3D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins with molecular weight as low as 90kDa. These results demonstrate that higher resolutions and improved 3D density map quality can be achieved even for small membrane proteins, an important use case for single particle cryo-EM, both in structural biology and drug discovery. Non-uniform refinement is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package and has already been used successfully in several notable structural studies.
13a4001b232c5ebb12820ebf7a2beca29f2c52b6	Clinical data from 488 cats with histopathologically confirmed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and 620 comparable controls were evaluated retrospectively to assess the value of several diagnostic tests frequently used in the evaluation of cats with suspected FIP. Diagnostic utility of serum albumin to globulin ratio for the diagnosis of FIP was greater than of the utility of serum total protein and ␥-globulin concentrations. Diagnostic utility of these variables was higher when performed on effusion. On effusion, positive and negative predictive values of Rivalta's test, a test that distinguishes between exudates and transudates (0.86 and 0.97), anti-coronavirus antibody detection (0.90 and 0.79), and immunofluorescence staining of coronavirus antigen in macrophages (1.00 and 0.57) were investigated. The positive and negative predictive values of presence of anti-coronavirus antibodies were 0.44 and 0.90, respectively, antibody concentrations (1 : 1,600) were 0.94 and 0.88, presence of immune complexes measured by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were 0.67 and 0.84, and detection of viral RNA by serum reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were 0.90 and 0.47. Effusion RT-PCR was performed in 6 cats; it was positive in all 5 cats with FIP and negative in the cat with another disease. Diagnostic assays on the fluid in cats with body effusion had good predictive values. Definitive diagnosis of FIP on the basis of measurement of various variables in serum was not possible. Serum tests can only be used to facilitate the decision for more invasive diagnostic methods.
5ee23d0181f81d3ba5241d80590f78c79ed304f5	The coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein packages viral genomic RNA into a ribonucleoprotein complex. Interactions between N proteins and RNA are thus crucial for the assembly of infectious virus particles. The 45 kDa recombinant nucleocapsid N protein of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is highly sensitive to proteolysis. We obtained a stable fragment of 14.7 kDa spanning its N-terminal residues 29-160 (IBV-N29-160). Like the N-terminal RNA binding domain (SARS-N45-181) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) N protein, the crystal structure of the IBV-N29-160 fragment at 1.85 Å resolution reveals a protein core composed of a five-stranded antiparallel b sheet with a positively charged b hairpin extension and a hydrophobic platform that are probably involved in RNA binding. Crosslinking studies demonstrate the formation of dimers, tetramers, and higher multimers of IBV-N. A model for coronavirus shell formation is proposed in which dimerization of the C-terminal domain of IBV-N leads to oligomerization of the IBV-nucleocapsid protein and viral RNA condensation.
2fe8c4247afea297eb4581229971076dcfd90dc6	• Contact heterogeneity and age-structured risk is represented in a metapopulation model. • The metapopulation model can be used in the near-term to make joint predictions on cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities at county levels. • In Georgia, a long-term plateauing epidemic, rather than a distinctive epidemic peak, is possible. Epidemiological forecasts of COVID-19 spread at the country and/or state level have helped shape public health interventions. However, such models leave a scale-gap between the spatial resolution of actionable information (i.e. the county or city level) and that of modeled viral spread. States and nations are not spatially homogeneous and different areas may vary in disease risk and severity. For example, COVID-19 has age-stratified risk. Similarly, ICU units, PPE and other vital equipment are not equally distributed within states. Here, we implement a county-level epidemiological framework to assess and forecast COVID-19 spread through Georgia, where 1,933 people have died from COVID-19 and 44,638 cases have been documented as of May 27, 2020. We find that county-level forecasts trained on heterogeneity due to clustered events can continue to predict epidemic spread over multiweek periods, potentially serving efforts to prepare medical resources, manage supply chains, and develop targeted public health interventions. We find that the premature removal of physical (social) distancing could lead to rapid increases in cases or the emergence of sustained plateaus of elevated fatalities.

0f10b9135da412f952e22d837c527929e6fdf1de	Our application concerns the fusion of classifiers for the recognition of trees from their leaves, in the framework of belief functions theory. In order to improve the rate of good classification it is necessary to correct Bayesian mass functions. This correction will be done from the meta-knowledge which is estimated from the confusion matrix. The corrected mass functions considerably improve the recognition rate based on the decisions provided by the classifiers.
73c211fb99f049eeeba71226f71a75333f9f3bb1	We aimed to model the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on the clinical academic response in England, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research. A stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in England, incorporating the following key factors which affect the ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). Clinical academics in primary and secondary care in England. Equivalent of 3200 full-time clinical academics in England. Four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: "Italy model" (6%), "mitigation" (10%), "relaxed mitigation" (40%) and "do-nothing" (80%) scenarios. Low and high strain on the health system (no clinical academics able to do research at 10% and 5% infection rate, respectively. PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone. Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.

2d3e4cc0e477c431b1c7b98be0175f4d30462959	We consider coloured Petri nets, qualitative and quantitative ones alike, as supported by our PetriNuts tool family, comprising, among others, Snoopy, Marcie and Spike. Currently, most analysis and simulation techniques require to unfold the given coloured Petri net into its corresponding plain, uncoloured Petri net representation. This unfolding step is rather straightforward for finite discrete colour sets, but tends to be time-consuming due to the potentially huge number of possible transition bindings. We present an unfolding approach building on a special type of symbolic data structures, called Interval Decision Diagram, and compare its runtime performance with an unfolding engine employing an off-the-shelf library to solve constraint satisfaction problems. For this comparison we use the 22 scalable coloured models from the MCC benchmark suite, complemented by a few from our own collection.
9ebc09cec2a54ebc2629bf09e02a6c19493fc750	CoV. The infection of SARS-CoV is mediated mainly through the viral surface glycoproteins, which consist of S1 and S2 subunits and form trimer spikes on the envelope of the virions. Here we report the ectodomain structures of the SARS-CoV surface spike trimer in different conformational states determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The conformation 1 determined at 4.3 Å resolution is three-fold symmetric and has all the three receptor-binding C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) of the S1 subunits in "down" positions. The binding of the "down" CTD1s to the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is not possible due to steric clashes, suggesting that the conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state. Conformations 2-4 determined at 7.3, 5.7 and 6.8 Å resolutions are all asymmetric, in which one RBD rotates away from the "down" position by different angles to an "up" position. The "up" CTD1 exposes the receptor-binding site for ACE2 engagement, suggesting that the conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding active state. This conformational change is also required for the binding of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the CTD1. This phenomenon could be extended to other betacoronaviruses utilizing CTD1 of the S1 subunit for receptor binding, which provides new insights into the intermediate states of coronavirus pre-fusion spike trimer during infection.
62c23f3f578d475604de3d6dc5c4cd671a745e8b	Multi-compartment models have been playing a central role in modelling infectious disease dynamics since the early 20th century. They are a class of mathematical models widely used for describing the mechanism of an evolving epidemic. Integrated with certain sampling schemes, such mechanistic models can be applied to analyse public health surveillance data, such as assessing the effectiveness of preventive measures (e.g. social distancing and quarantine) and forecasting disease spread patterns. This review begins with a nationwide macromechanistic model and related statistical analyses, including model specification, estimation, inference and prediction. Then, it presents a community-level micromodel that enables high-resolution analyses of regional surveillance data to provide current and future risk information useful for local government and residents to make decisions on reopenings of local business and personal travels. R software and scripts are provided whenever appropriate to illustrate the numerical detail of algorithms and calculations. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic surveillance data from the state of Michigan are used for the illustration throughout this paper.
40d7bf2f2f57aa74f36b081535d501b8c4a90231	An Iranian isolate of avian infectious bronchitis virus IRFIBV32 was quantified in experimentally infected broilers using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and histopathological changes was investigated. Thirty-six 3-week-old commercial broilers were inoculated by 10 5 ELD50/0.1 ml of the virus. On the various days post inoculation (dpi) different tissues were collected. The virus strongly started the replication in trachea at 1 dpi and reached to the maximum titer at 3 dpi. The highest IBV RNA level was shown in this organ. In lung, the virus was replicated with the titer lower than that of the trachea, but it rose up more at 5 dpi. The kidneys were the tissues with the least viral genome copy number, although the duration of the virus presence was considerable. The virus replicated in testes sooner than ovaries also disappeared sooner but the maximum viral yield in the ovaries was more. The virus titer in the studied tissues had an interesting fluctuation especially in caecal tonsils. Testes and ovaries were the organs that the virus could reactivate without using any chemical. The most severe lesions were observed in tracheae but they appeared in the lungs later. Lymphocyte infiltration in the kidneys was noted from 5 dpi even sooner than the lungs. There were no lesions in the caecal tonsils, testes and ovaries in spite of the virus replication in a high titer.
02615ffd9898d5abf64271c90647c7466b1188ee	Early warning and emergency management is a comprehensive and integrated system that deals with all sorts of emergencies, risks and crises, and involves various sectors of society and government departments. A consistent and holistic approach, however, has previously been lacking in both research and practice. Scholars of natural sciences and social sciences address the subject differently, so do academics and practitioners; and compartmentalization often characterizes different regions, departments and organizations' responses to emergencies. These problems are particularly clearly manifested in the catastrophic winter storm that hit southern China in 2008.
abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	The COVID-19 pandemic has forced societies across the world to resort to social distancing to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the US and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.
84421202bce46a02200bcb26d92f3ef7bafad462	The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has revealed major gaps in our ability to 25 respond to new virulent pathogens. Rapid, accurate, and easily configurable molecular 26 diagnostic tests are imperative to prevent global spread of new diseases. CRISPR-based 27 diagnostic approaches are proving to be useful as field-deployable solutions. In a basic 28 form of this assay, the CRISPR-Cas12 enzyme complexes with a synthetic guide RNA 29 (gRNA). This complex is activated when it highly specifically binds to target DNA, and 30 the activated complex non-specifically cleaves single-stranded DNA reporter probes 31 labeled with a fluorophore-quencher pair. We recently discovered that electric field 32 gradients can be used to control and accelerate this CRISPR assay by co-focusing 33 Cas12-gRNA, reporters, and target. We achieve an appropriate electric field gradient 34 using a selective ionic focusing technique known as isotachophoresis (ITP) implemented 35 on a microfluidic chip. Unlike previous CRISPR diagnostic assays, we also use ITP for 36 automated purification of target RNA from raw nasopharyngeal swab sample. We here 37 combine this ITP purification with loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and the ITP-38 enhanced CRISPR assay to achieve detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (from raw sample to 39 result) in 30 min for both contrived and clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. This 40 electric field control enables a new modality for a suite of microfluidic CRISPR-based 41 diagnostic assays. 42 43 3 Rapid, early-stage screening is especially crucial during pandemics for early identification 45 of infected patients and control of disease spread. CRISPR biology offers new methods 46 for rapid and accurate pathogen detection. Despite their versatility and specificity, existing 47 CRISPR-diagnostic methods suffer from the requirements of up-front nucleic acid 48 extraction, large reagent volumes, and several manual steps-factors which prolong the 49 process and impede use in low resource settings. We here combine on-chip electric-field 50 control in combination with CRIPSR biology to directly address these limitations of current 51 CRISPR-diagnostic methods. We apply our method to the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-52 2 RNA in clinical samples. Our method takes 30 min from raw sample to result, a 53 significant improvement over existing diagnostic methods for COVID-19. 54 55 56
eab07939131ec9369c690c6f32cc84a6e5114c35	Cox, Plavnick, and Brodhead (2020, "A Proposed Process for Risk Mitigation During the COVID-19 Pandemic") published a position statement in the emergency section of Behavior Analysis in Practice in response to the COVID-19 crisis. They argued against a blanket interpretation that in-person applied behavior analysis services for all patients should continue during the pandemic. They strongly argued that the risks of continued services are almost always prohibitive and that only in rare cases would the continuation of in-person services be warranted. Colombo, Wallace, and Taylor (2020, "An Essential Service Decisions Model for Applied Behavior Analytic Providers During Crisis") soon thereafter published a response to the article pointing out the potential dangers associated with the position of the article by Cox et al. They included a detailed decision model to assist providers in making nuanced and informed data-based decisions that provide the opportunity to honor the ethical responsibility for not abandoning patients. We echo the importance of the Colombo et al. response and add points of response centered on balanced ethical decision making informed by compassionate family-centered care.
1b0f1920fee9112f18e408069d184cf7ca5651ac	The minor discomforts of pregnancy present difficulties for the health care provider as well as for the pregnant woman herself. Management of the various symptoms requires astute observations and the ability to individualize therapy. Knowledge of a variety of treatment options, therefore, allows practitioners to collaborate with their patients in selecting the best therapeutic approach for the specific situation. This three-part series reviews the common discomforts associated with upper respiratory infections, minor pain, and gastrointestinal problems as they are manifested during pregnancy. Both nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical therapies are discussed. Frequent references are made to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Risk Factors which categorize both over-the-counter and prescribed drugs according to their documented safety for ingestion during pregnancy.
23c73c43a29db780b6ac9a0fedcde14cb6ceb496	Enveloped viruses, which include many medically important viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus and hepatitis C virus, are intracellular parasites that acquire lipid envelopes from their host cells. Success of replication is intimately linked to their ability to hijack host cell mechanisms, particularly those related to membrane dynamics and lipid metabolism. Despite recent progress, our knowledge of lipid mediated virus-host interactions remains highly incomplete. In addition, diverse experimental systems are used to study different stages of virus replication thus complicating comparisons. This review aims to present a unifying view of the widely diverse strategies used by enveloped viruses at distinct stages of their replication cycles.
32095de948f289ba4bc40c730a5f2a90a5cb09b7	Coronavirus disease 2019 is an ongoing global pandemic that has spread rapidly since December 2019. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging both play an important role in COVID-19 diagnosis. Chest CT imaging offers the benefits of quick reporting, a low cost, and high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary infection. Recently, deep-learning-based computer vision methods have demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT imaging. However, training a deep-learning model requires large volumes of data, and medical staff faces a high risk when collecting COVID-19 CT data due to the high infectivity of the disease. Another issue is the lack of experts available for data labeling. In order to meet the data requirements for COVID-19 CT imaging, we propose a CT image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network that can effectively generate high-quality and realistic COVID-19 CT images for use in deep-learningbased medical imaging tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image synthesis methods with the generated COVID-19 CT images and indicates promising for various machine learning applications including semantic segmentation and classification.
32094ea4335fb12c532c995e7751c94a753f8626	Falsified and substandard (SF) medications are a large and growing global public health threat affecting developed and developing markets. The need for scalable, easy-to-use, accurate methods to detect SF medications continues to grow. We conducted a proofof-principle laboratory and field-sample evaluation of MedSnap in Vientiane, Lao PDR. Over three days, MedSnap models were created from trusted and authentic medications and tested against samples of authentic/trusted or falsified artesunate, artemether-lumefantrine, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. Across 49 tests of authentic/trusted and falsified samples, MedSnap was 100% sensitive and specific. On the final day of the study, a convenience sample of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin was collected from local pharmacies and tested. Each purchased sample matched an authentic or trusted model. The speed and ease of data collection, reference model building, and sample testing suggest scalable use cases for the system.
c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199	A new influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) virus emerged in April 2009, proceeded to spread worldwide, and was designated as an influenza pandemic. A/H1N1 viruses had circulated in 1918-1957 and 1977-2009 and were in the annual vaccine during 1977-2009. Methods. Serum antibody to the pH1N1 and seasonal A/H1N1 viruses was measured in 579 healthy adults at enrollment (fall 2009) and after surveillance for illness (spring 2010). Subjects reporting with moderate to severe acute respiratory illness had illness and virus quantitation for 1 week; evaluations for missed illnesses were conducted over holiday periods and at the spring 2010 visit. Results. After excluding 66 subjects who received pH1N1 vaccine, 513 remained. Seventy-seven had reported with moderate to severe illnesses; 31 were infected with pH1N1 virus, and 30 with a rhinovirus. Determining etiology from clinical findings was not possible, but fever and prominent myalgias favored influenza and prominent rhinorrhea favored rhinovirus. Tests of fall and spring antibody indicated pH1N1 infection of 23% had occurred, with the rate decreasing with increasing anti-pH1N1 antibody; a similar pattern was seen for influenza-associated illness. A reducing frequency of pH1N1 infections was also seen with increasing antibody to the recent seasonal A/ H1N1 virus (A/Brisbane/59/07). Preexisting antibody to pH1N1 virus, responses to a single vaccine dose, a low infection-to-illness ratio, and a short duration of illness and virus shedding among those with influenza indicated presence of considerable preexisting immunity to pH1N1 in the population. Conclusions. The 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic among healthy adults was relatively mild, most likely because of immunity from prior infections with A/H1N1 viruses.
8e64233f3ce51851740af4bce0fbefdbde0b8194	The immense patient number caused by coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic brings the urge for more knowledge about its immunological features, including the profile of basic immune parameters. In this study, eighty-eight reported COVID-19 patients in Wuhan were recruited from January to February, 2020, including 32 severe/critical cases and 56 mild/moderate cases. Their mean age was 56.43 years (range 17-83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and antibody test, which was significantly higher (P \ 0.001) than by single nucleic acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity.
d8b904a850c774ca810965d324284246e45f9432	In this study, we performed a single-centred study of 307 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. It was found that co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus was common during COVID-19 outbreak. And patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza B virus have a higher risk of developing poor outcomes so a detection of both viruses was recommended during COVID-19 outbreak.
7a920d6b53c292f53323cb6c5109732a9575e33c	Despite the significant progress in the recent efforts toward developing an effective vaccine against toxoplasmosis, the search for new protective vaccination strategy still remains a challenge and elusive goal because it becomes the appropriate way to prevent the disease. Various experimental approaches in the past few years showed that developing a potential vaccine against the disease can be achievable. The combination of multi-epitopes expressing different stages of the parasite life cycle has become an optimal strategy for acquiring a potent, safe, and effective vaccine. Epitope-based vaccines have gained attention as alternative vaccine candidates due to their ability of inducing protective immune responses. This mini-review highlights the current status and the prospects of Toxoplasma gondii vaccine development along with the application of epitope-based vaccine in the future parasite immunization as a novel under development and evaluation strategy. ARTICLE HISTORY
618a793838421a7bf238e8f6ae2635ca3d2f5a25	Nucleotide deprivation and imbalance present detrimental conditions for animals and are thus expected to trigger cellular responses that direct protective changes in metabolic, developmental, and behavioral programs, albeit such mechanisms are vastly underexplored. Following our previous finding that Caenorhabditis elegans shut down germ cell proliferation in response to pyrimidine deprivation, we find in this study that endonuclease ENDU-2 regulates nucleotide metabolism and germ cell proliferation in response to nucleotide imbalance and other genotoxic stress, and that it affects mitotic chromosomal segregation in the intestine and lifespan. ENDU-2 expression is induced by nucleotide imbalance and genotoxic stress, and ENDU-2 exerts its function in the intestine, mostly by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 through repressing the PKA pathway and histone deacetylase HDA-1. Human EndoU also affects the response to genotoxic drugs. Our work reveals an unknown role of ENDU-2 in regulating nucleotide metabolism and animals' response to genotoxic stress, which may link EndoU function to cancer treatment. Jia et al. show that an endonuclease plays a critical role in a nucleotide response system in nematodes and possibly mammalian cells. It affects nucleotide metabolism and reproductive development in response to nucleotide imbalance or other stresses, and it does so by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CTP synthase in the gut.

fc6e0a777f7153bb73241fe24f906b53b831a86c	Antibody neutralization is an important prognostic factor in many viral diseases. To easily and rapidly measure titers of neutralizing antibodies in serum or plasma, we developed pseudovirion particles composed of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 incorporated onto murine leukemia virus capsids and a modified minimal MLV genome encoding firefly luciferase. These pseudovirions provide a practical means of assessing immune responses under laboratory conditions consistent with biocontainment level 2.
179c0b354c8a3b8ca429df3bd022a1825203aa60	The host immune system is highly compromised in case of viral infections and relapses are very common. The capacity of the virus to destroy the host cell by liberating its own DNA or RNA and replicating inside the host cell poses challenges in the development of antiviral therapeutics. In recent years, many new technologies have been explored for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral infections. Nanotechnology has emerged as one of the most promising technologies on account of its ability to deal with viral diseases in an effective manner, addressing the limitations of traditional antiviral medicines. It has not only helped us to overcome problems related to solubility and toxicity of drugs, but also imparted unique properties to drugs, which in turn has increased their potency and selectivity toward viral cells against the host cells. The initial part of the paper focuses on some important proteins of influenza, Ebola, HIV, herpes, Zika, dengue, and corona virus and those of the host cells important for their entry and replication into the host cells. This is followed by different types of nanomaterials which have served as delivery vehicles for the antiviral drugs. It includes various lipid-based, polymer-based, lipid-polymer hybrid-based, carbon-based, inorganic metal-based, surface-modified, and stimuli-sensitive nanomaterials and their application in antiviral therapeutics. The authors also highlight newer promising treatment approaches like nanotraps, nanorobots, nanobubbles, nanofibers, nanodiamonds, nanovaccines, and mathematical modeling for the future. The paper has been updated with the recent developments in nanotechnology-based approaches in view of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.
3f382a34f8b5868ce581f3fa4fa861657bac246c	Background and objective: Despite medical advances, we are facing the unprecedented disaster of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic without available treatments and effective vaccines. As the COVID-19 pandemic has approached its culmination, desperate efforts have been made to seek proper treatments and response strategies, and the number of clinical trials has been rapidly increasing. In this time of the pandemic, it is believed that learning lessons from it would be meaningful in preparing for future pandemics. Thus, this study aims at providing a comprehensive landscape of COVID-19 related clinical trials based on the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Materials and methods: Up to 30 March 2020, we identified a total of 147 eligible clinical trials and reviewed the overview of the studies. Results: Until then, the most clinical trials were set up in China. Treatment approaches are the most frequent purpose of the registered studies. Chloroquine, interferon, and antiviral agents such as remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir are agents under investigation in these trials. Conclusions: In this study, we introduced the promising therapeutic options that many researchers and clinicians are interested in, and to address the hidden issues behind clinical trials in this COVID-19 pandemic.
24c13a08191ba9661c9e4d53336eb4fb069fcaf6	Ontogenetisch geht die Schilddrüse aus dem Entoderm der Schlundtasche hervor. Die Schilddrüsenanlage bildet sich in der 4. SSW und wandert nach kaudal bis zur endgültigen Position vor der Trachea. Der Ductus thyreoglossus verbindet initial Schilddrüsenanlage und Ursprungsort, dieser verschließt sich in der weiteren Embryonalentwicklung. In seinem Verlauf kann sich dystopes Schilddrüsengewebe ansiedeln, Reste kranial der Schilddrüse bilden den variablen Lobus pyramidalis. Anatomisch besteht die Schilddrüse aus 2 Lappen, die über den vor der Trachea liegenden Isthmus miteinander verbunden sind. Die gesunde Schilddrüse wiegt 15-20 g. Mikroskopisch sind die Thyreozyten zu Schilddrüsenfollikel zusammengeschlossen. Diese enthalten im Lumen das Kolloid, welches überwiegend aus Thyreoglobulin besteht. Zwischen den Follikel liegen die parafollikulären C-Zellen und Ultimobrachialkörperreste (»solid cell nest«). Im Interstitium zwischen den Follikeln sind Nervenfasern, retikuläre Fasern und ein dichtes Netz aus Blut-und Lymphkapillaren ausgebildet. Arterielle Blutversorgung: Die paarig angelegte A. thyroidea superior entspringt der A. carotis externa und erreicht die Schilddrüse über den oberen Pol. Die paarig angelegte A. thyroidea inferior entspringt dem Truncus thyreocervicalis und versorgt die Schilddrüse über den Unterpol. Die unpaar und mittelständige A. thyroidea ima findet sich in 5-10%, entspringt dem Aortenbogen und erreicht die Schilddrüse am Isthmus oder unteren Pol. Zahlreiche kleinere Arterienäste finden von der Vorder-und Seitenfläche Zutritt zur Schilddrüse, intraparenchymatöse Äste aller vorsorgenden Arterien bilden ein komplexes Anastomosengeflecht, daher können die vier Hauptarterien ohne resultierende Ernährungsstörung der Schilddrüse ligiert werden. Venöser Blutabfluss: über ein Venengeflecht unter der Schilddrüsenkapsel überwiegender Abfluss epitracheal über den Plexus thyroideus impar in die V. thyroidea inferior und V. brachiocephalica von den Lappen direkter Abfluss über die V. thyroidea media Kocher in die V. jugularis interna begleitend zu den oberen Polgefäßen ziehen Venen in die V. jugularis interna oder V. facialis. Nervale Innervation: Die sympathische Innervation erfolgt über Nn. thyroideii superiores, medialis et inferiores vom Ganglion cervicale superior, media 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 4 5 4 5 5.1 · Hals 5 123 Eigene Notizen oder inferior. Die parasympathische Innervation erfolgt durch den N. vagus und gelangt durch Nn. laryngei zur Schilddrüse. Der N. laryngeus recurrens besitzt eine herausragende Bedeutung für die Phonation, dieser verläuft zwischen Ösophagus und Trachea und kreuzt die A. thyroidea inferior variabel vor, hinter sowie teils vor und hinter Ästen der A. thyroidea inferior. Motorische Äste innervieren die Larynxmuskulatur mit Ausnahme des M. cricothyroideus. Eine unilaterale Schädigung des Nervs führt zum ipsilateralen Stimmbandstillstand, eine bilaterale Läsion zum bilateralen Stillstand, die oft eine Tracheotomie erfordert. N. laryngeus superior aus dem Ganglion inferius des N. vagus. R. externus innerviert den M. cricothyroideus und ist topographisch eng mit der A. thyroidea superior verbunden (Voreinstellungen des Kehlkopfes ermöglichen hier die Bildung hoher Töne). Der R. internus führt vorwiegend sensible Fasern welche die Schleimhaut der Epiglottis und des Larynx bis unterhalb der Stimmritze versorgen. Lymphabfluss und Lymphknotengruppen: Der Lymphabfluss der Schilddrüse erfolgt unter der Capsula fibrosa durch ein weitverzweigtes Netz in die regionären Lymphknoten. Der Abfluss folgt weitestgehend den o.g. Venen. Die Lymphabflussgebiete der Lappen erfolgt nicht streng seitengetrennt, Kommunikationen bestehen durch Querverbindungen über prälaryngeale und prätracheale Lymphknoten. Die lokoregionären Lymphknotengruppen werden nach anatomischen Grenzen in 4 Kompartimente unterteilt: zervikozentrale Lymphknoten (Kompartiment 1a und 1b): medial der Trachea und lateral der A. carotis, nach kranial begrenzt durch die Karotisgabel und nach kaudal durch die obere Thoraxapertur zervikolaterale Lymphknoten (Kompartiment 2 und 3): retrojuguläre Lymphknoten und die des lateralen Halsdreiecks bis zu den Ästen des Plexus brachialis, nach kranial begrenzt vom N. hypoglossus und kaudal von der oberen Thoraxapertur obere mediastinale Lymphknoten (Kompartiment 4a und 4b): kaudal der V. brachiocephalica und der V. subclavia > Memo Die Mehrzahl der differenzierten Schilddrüsenkarzinome metastasieren vorwiegend in das zervikozentrale (44%) oder ipsilaterale-zervikolaterale (34%) Kompartiment. 126 Kapitel 5 · Viszeralchirurgie Eigene Notizen 5 Subtotale Resektion: Bei der subtotalen Resektion wird beidseits dorsales Schilddrüsengewebe und die dorsale Kapsel belassen. Ein heute seltener Eingriff, ggf. bei diffuser Autonomie mit dorsal beidseits unauffälligem Gewebe. Hemithyreoidektomie: Bei großen Knoten bei Struma uninodosa, bei Karzinomverdacht bei »kaltem« Knoten. Nachgewiesenes papilläres Mikrokarzinom. Die betroffene Seite wird am Isthmus abgesetzt und unter Schonung der Epithelkörperchen vollständig reseziert. Hemithyreoidektomie mit subtotaler Resektion der Gegenseite (Dunhill): Bei unilateraler Struma nodosa mit Knoten am Unterpol der Gegenseite, zur Volumenverkleinerung bei euthyreoter Struma, zur Verringerung des funktionell veränderten Gewebes bei Hyperthyreose. Da sich am Oberpol zumeist gesundes Gewebe findet, wird der obere Pol der weniger betroffenen Seite belassen. Thyreoidektomie: erforderlich bei: Struma nodosa beidseits Karzinomnachweis mit großem Tumor medullärem Schilddrüsenkarzinom undifferenzierten Karzinomen als Rezidivprophylaxe bei Morbus Basedow thyreotoxischer Krise minimal-invasive Operationstechniken: Der Anteil an minimalinvasiven Techniken ist mit insgesamt 10% aller Schilddrüsenoperationen noch gering. minimal-invasive videoassistierte Schilddrüsenoperation (MI-VAT): Häufigste Technik, wird jedoch kontrovers diskutiert. Als Vorteil werden das bessere kosmetische Ergebnis, geringere postoperative Beschwerden und eine gute Detailansicht angegeben. total-videoendoskopische Strumaresektion via »axillobilateral breast approach« (ABBA): Die Operation erfolgt minimal-invasiv von submammär und über die Axilla. Sehr seltene Technik die keinerlei Narben am Hals verursacht.
a52f56e677d5be30763e9d69044f5b096d5b9868	Viral membrane proteins extracted from Sendai virions with the non-ionic detergents decylpolyethyleneglycol-300 and Triton X-100 were used as a model mixture of hydrophobic membrane proteins. The detergent extract contained the fusion protein (F) and the tetrameric and dimeric forms of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN). These proteins were purified by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate, by ion-exchange and metal chelate affinity HPLC in the presence of 0.1% decylpolyethyleneglycol, and by reversed-phase HPLC without prior removal of the detergent. The tetramer of HN and F could be purified by size-exclusion HPLC after dissociation of a micellar aggregate containing tetrameric HN and multimeric F. The F and HN proteins could be purified by ion-exchange HPLC. Pure F protein could be obtained after metal chelate affinity HPLC. The F protein and the dimer and tetramer of HN could be eluted from a large-pore (100 nm) reversed-phase column, but they were eluted as broad, overlapping peaks. Only after reduction of the virion extract, the relatively small (13-15 kilodaltons) F2 protein could be obtained in pure form.
53bf22d5044b1714339ed1bd2b789fe493a2fe51	In summer 2015, a Saudi 1000-bed tertiary care hospital experienced a serious outbreak among patients of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS); during which, some healthcare providers contracted the virus, but none died. The outbreak provoked not only fear and stress; but also professional, emotional, ethical, and social conflicts and tension among healthcare providers and patients alike. Therefore, this study aims to explore what healthcare providers, who survived coronavirus infection, have experienced as a MERS patient and how the infection affected their relationship with their colleagues. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted individually with seven survivors (healthcare providers). Each interview lasted up to 90 min, and the data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique. Within the participants' rich and illuminating experiences, four themes were identified: caring for others in the defining moments, perceived prejudice behaviours and stigmatization, lived moments of traumatic fear and despair, and denial and underestimation of the seriousness of the disease at the individual and organizational levels. Survivors still suffered as a result of their traumatic experiences, which might negatively influence their performance. As these survivors are vulnerable, it is their organization's responsibility to provide a system that embraces HCPs during and after disastrous events.
b6f0cbd340d8c233097c0a874ce3058a7b9e84f8	Background In the vast majority of the laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients, computed tomography (CT) examinations yield a typical pattern and the sensitivity of this modality has been reported to be 97% in a large-scale study. Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. Purpose To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. Material and methods We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. Results We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. Conclusion The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. • Chest CT has high sensitivity in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. • The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.
5b762aad8d986397c11473bc2b29b08e512cb9ba	The vegetation history of S.W. Connemara was reconstructed on the basis of the available palynological andpalaeobotanical dataofthe region. InthePre-Boreal Period birch forests replaced the late-glacial tundra-like vegetation. In theearly Boreal Period hazel immigrated and theeutraphent water plant communities reached their optimum. After that thermophilous deciduous forests gradually crowded out the birch woods and reached their optimum in the Atlantic Period. The lakes were increasingly filled with peat, theeutraphent character of the marsh vegetation weakened and ombrogenous bog communities spread across theregion. Shortly before theSub-Boreal Period the first indications of human interference in the forests were detectable. During the Sub-Boreal and Sub-Atlantic Periods the forest area was reduced gradually as a result of human activities and the spreading ofthebogs. Amore orless complete forest clearance tookplace in thelastthousand years.

9c924d860dceffdab52e07acfae70a54cb5c9baf	Zusammenfassung: Der folgende Artikel gibt eine aktuelle Übersicht zu dem neu aufgetretenen Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Erstmals im Sommer 2012 kam es in Ländern der arabischen Halbinsel zu schweren Infektionen der Atemwege durch ein neues Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Dabei wurden die meisten Erkrankungsfälle aus Saudi-Arabien gemeldet, in Deutschland wurden bisher mehrere importierte Krankheitsfälle berichtet. Nach Beginn mit grippeähnlichen Symptomen folgt meist die Entwicklung einer Pneumonie mit Übergang in ein akutes Atemnotsyndrom. Die Letalitätsrate wird auf 55% geschätzt. Über die Erkrankung sollte im Rahmen der reisemedizinischen Beratung ausführlich aufgeklärt werden und sie ist insofern auch für die Arbeitsmedizin von großer Bedeutung.
be905efa72cca903d9c578c4f905b98822089106	A novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 to cause severe acute respiratory symptoms . In this meta-analysis, we estimated case fatality rate from COVID-19 infection by random effect meta-analysis model with country level data. Publicly accessible web database WorldOMeter (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) was accessed on 24th March 2020 GMT and reported total number of cases, total death, active cases and seriously ill/ critically ill patients were retrieved. Primary outcome of this meta-analysis was case fatality rate defined by total number of deaths divided by total number of diagnosed cases. Pooled case fatality rate (95% CI) was 1.78 (1.34-2.22) %. Between country heterogeneity was 0.018 (p<0.0001). Pooled estimate of composite poor outcome (95% CI) was 4.06 (3.24-4.88) % at that point of time after exclusion of countries reported small number of cases. Pooled mortality rate (95% CI) was 33.97 (27.44-40.49) % amongst closed cases (where patients have recovered or died) with. Meta regression analysis identified statistically significant association between health expenditure and mortality amongst closed cases (p=0.037).
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	Background: Health promotion and security of manpower in a society is one of the pillars to progress a society. Anxiety, is the most common psychological disorder in societies and occupations like nursing‚ anesthesia technicians and operation room technicians. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence of anxiety, and its severity in Iranian nurses working in operation room. Also, we determined the most important associated factors with anxiety. In this cross sectional study‚ 152 nurses working in operating room participated. The tool to gather the data was a questionnaire, that included three parts; demographic information‚ obvious anxiety questions and hidden anxiety questions of Spielburger. Obtained data was analysed with SPSS 16 software. The majority of participants were females (94.7%) with experience at work less than 10 years (84.9%). The average scores of participants in obvious and hidden anxiety were 41.9±39.4 (range 20 to 75) and 39.4±8.2 (range 20 to 70), respectively. Anxiety level was significantly higher in females than males (P=0.04). The most prevalent cause of anxiety, was contact with infected biological factors (23% of nurses). The less important cause was concern about retirement (42.8% of nurses). Our results suggest that, anxiety disorders is prevalent in Iranian nurses working in public city hospitals, which warrants immediate programs for intervention to improve working situations in work place.

0750fc2885593b95ee08d4675afe24c13ab4fa42	Super learner algorithm can be applied to combine results of multiple base learners to improve quality of predictions. The default method for verification of super learner results is by nested cross validation; however, this technique is very expensive computationally. It has been proposed by Tsamardinos et al., that nested cross validation can be replaced by resampling for tuning hyper-parameters of the learning algorithms. The main contribution of this study is to apply this idea to verification of super learner. We compare the new method with other verification methods, including nested cross validation. Tests were performed on artificial data sets of diverse size and on seven real, biomedical data sets. The resampling method, called Bootstrap Bias Correction, proved to be a reasonably precise and very cost-efficient alternative for nested cross validation.
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	Background. The rising COVID-19 pandemic caused many governments to impose policies restricting social interactions. These policies have slowed down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the extent that restrictions can be gradually lifted. Models can be useful to assess the consequences of deconfinement strategies with respect to business, school and leisure activities. Methods. We adapted the individual-based model "STRIDE" to simulate interactions between the 11 million inhabitants of Belgium at the levels of households, workplaces, schools and communities. We calibrated our model to observed hospital incidence and seroprevalence data. STRIDE can explore contact tracing options and account for repetitive leisure contacts in extended household settings (so called "household bubbles") with varying levels of connectivity. Findings. Household bubbles have the potential to reduce the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions by up to 90%. The effectiveness of contact tracing depends on its timing, as it becomes futile more than 4 days after the index case developed symptoms. Assuming that children have a lower level of susceptibility and lower probability to experience symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, (partial) school closure options have relatively little impact on COVID-19 burden. Interpretation. Not only the absolute number and intensity of physical contacts drive the transmission dynamics and COVID-19 burden, also their repetitiveness is influential. Contact tracing seems essential for a controlled and persistent release of lockdown measures, but requires timely compliance to testing, reporting and self-isolation. Rapid tracing and testing, and communication ensuring continued involvement of the population are therefore essential.
4d05de6afc581f05e02d638a89f63a4bfc9d1dcb	The main challenge of technology is to facilitate the tasks and to transfer the functions that are usually performed by the humans to the nonhumans. However, the pervasion of machines in everyday life requires that the non-humans are increasingly closer in their abilities to the ordinary thought, action and behaviour of the humans. This view merges the idea of the Humaniter, a longstanding myth in the history of technology: an artificial creature that thinks, acts and feels like a human to the point that one cannot make the difference between the two. In the wake of the opposition of Strong AI and Weak AI, this challenge can be expressed in terms of a shift from the performance of intelligence (reason, reasoning, cognition, judgment) to that of sentience (experience, sensation, emotion, consciousness). In other words, the challenge of technology if this possible shift is taken seriously is to move from the paradigm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to that of Artificial Sentience (AS). But for the Humaniter not to be regarded as a mere myth, any intelligent or sentient machine must pass through a Test of Humanity that refers to or that differs from the Turing Test. One can suggest several options for this kind of test and also point out some conditions and limits to the very idea of the Humaniter as an artificial human.
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	In a world where climate change, vector expansion, human activity, and pathogen dispersal do not respect boundaries, the human-animal-pathogen interface has become less defined. Consequently, a One Health approach to disease surveillance and control has generated much interest across several disciplines. This systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease, and critically appraises how this may be applied within Canada. Results highlighted a bias in research from highand middle-income-economy countries, with 35% of the studies describing data from the Latin America/Caribbean region, 25% from North America, and 11% from the European/Central Asia region. Bacteria were the most studied type of infectious agent, followed by protozoa, viruses, helminths, and fungi. Only six out of 142 studies described disease in Canada: four researched a variety of pathogens within Indigenous communities, one researched Borrelia burgdorferi in British Columbia, and one researched arboviruses in Quebec. Results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious-disease pathogens in Canada, yet are currently overlooked. Further research into the use of dog-sentinel surveillance is specifically recommended for California serogroup viruses, Chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, Lyme borreliosis, Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Dirofilaria immitis.
c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	Health workers globally are at elevated occupational risk of tuberculosis infection and disease. While a raft of guidelines have been published over the past 25 years on infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare, studies in different settings continue to show inadequate implementation and persistence of risk. The aim of this commentary is to argue, based on the literature and our own research, that a comprehensive occupational health approach is an essential complement to IPC guidelines. Such an approach includes a health system framework focusing on upstream or mediating components, such as a statutory regulation, leadership, an information system, and staff trained in protective disciplines. Within the classical prevention framework, primary prevention needs to be complemented by occupational health services (secondary prevention) and worker's compensation (tertiary prevention). A worker-centric approach recognises the ethical implications of screening health workers, as well as the stigma perceived by those diagnosed with tuberculosis. It also provides for the voiced experience of health workers and their participation in decision-making. We argue that such a comprehensive approach will contribute to both the prevention of occupational tuberculosis and to the ability of a health system to withstand other crises of infectious hazards to its workforce.
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	The human lung comprises about 300 million alveoli which are located on bronchioles between the 17th to 24th generations of the acinar tree, with a progressively higher population density in the deeper branches (lower acini). The alveolar size and aspect ratio change with generation number. Due to successive bifurcation, the flow velocity magnitude also decreases as the bronchiole diameter decreases from the upper to lower acini. As a result, fluid dynamic parameters such as Reynolds (Re) and Womersley (a) numbers progressively decrease with increasing generation number. In order to characterize alveolar flow patterns and inhaled particle transport during synchronous ventilation, we have conducted measurements for a range of dimensionless parameters physiologically relevant to the upper acini. Acinar airflow patterns were measured using a simplified in vitro alveolar model consisting of a single transparent elastic truncated sphere (representing the alveolus) mounted over a circular hole on the side of a rigid circular tube (representing the bronchiole). The model alveolus was capable of expanding and contracting inphase with the oscillatory flow through the bronchiole thereby simulating synchronous ventilation. Realistic breathing conditions were achieved by exercising the model over a range of progressively varying geometric and dynamic parameters to simulate the environment within several generations of the acinar tree. Particle image velocimetry was used to measure the resulting flow patterns. Next, we used the measured flow fields to calculate particle trajectories to obtain particle transport and deposition statistics for massless and finite-size particles under the influence of flow advection and gravity. Our study shows that the geometric parameters (b and DV/V) primarily affect the velocity magnitudes, whereas the dynamic parameters (Re and a) distort the flow symmetry while also altering the velocity magnitudes. Consequently, the dynamic parameters have a greater influence on the particle trajectories and deposition statistics compared to the geometric parameters. The results from this study can benefit pulmonary research into the risk assessment of toxicological inhaled aerosols, and the pharmaceutical industry by providing better insight into the flow patterns and particle transport of inhalable therapeutics in the acini.
cfea768a5464db33748cdfb036857ff167ddad74	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with its public health implications, high case fatality rate, and strain on hospital resources, will continue to challenge clinicians and researchers alike for months to come. Accurate triage of patients during the pandemic will assign patients to the appropriate level of care, provide the best care for the maximum number of patients, rationally limit personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, and mitigate nosocomial exposures. The authors describe an adapted COVID-19 pandemic triage algorithm for emergency departments (EDs) guided by the best available evidence and responses to prior pandemics, with recommendations for clinician PPE use for each level of encounter in the setting of an ongoing PPE shortage. Our algorithm adheres to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and supports discharge of patients with mild symptoms coupled with explicit and strict return precautions and infection control education.
a3718ef8f5fc2e8b32992c568bc66646a870656c	Background: Acute diarrhea is one of the most serious problems in global public health that causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Human caliciviruses (HuCV) including norovirus (NoV, genogroup GI and GII) and sapovirus (SaV), is a leading cause of acute sporadic diarrhea in individuals across all age groups. However, few studies had been conducted clarifying the characteristics of HuCV in diarrhea cases across all age groups in China. Stool specimens were collected from 1,121 diarrhea cases and 319 healthy controls in outpatient departments. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect NoV (GI, GII) and SaV. Sequencing was applied to confirm the three viral infections and phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine their genotypes. A structured questionnaire was used to record the demographic information and clinical symptoms of subjects. Results: HuCV was detected at an 11.0 % infection rate in 1,121 diarrhea cases and at 3.4 % rate in 319 non-diarrhea subjects (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.5, 95 % CI 1.8-6.5). The prevalence of the NoV genogroup GII and genotype GII.4 in diarrhea cases was significantly higher than that found in healthy controls (p < 0.0001, p = 0.018, respectively). NoV GII (n = 118, 10.5 %) was the most common HuCV subtype in diarrhea cases, followed by SaV (n = 3, 0.3 %) and NoV GI (n = 2, 0.2 %). Of 118 NoV GII strains isolated from diarrhea patients. GII.4 (n = 55, 46.6 %) was the predominant strain, followed by GII.3 (n = 28, 23.7 %), GII.12 (n = 25, 21.2 %), GII.17 (n = 8, 6.8 %), and GII.5 (n = 2, 1.7 %). Of the 55 GII.4 strains, the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant had absolutely predominant prevalence (n = 52, 94.5 %), followed by the NoV GII.4-2006b variant (n = 3, 5.5 %). The GII.4 Orleans 2009 variant was not found in diarrhea cases of the study. Conclusions: NoV GII was the major genogroup and GII.4 was the most predominant strain detected in diarrhea patients. The GII.17 is an emergent variant in sporadic diarrhea and might become the predominant strain in diarrhea cases in the near future. Rapid, accurate detection kits need to be developed to help us find and treat NoV-associated diarrhea in clinical settings in a timely manner.
04510f144938a17bf2c2a9683ce3479ff0246b94	Background: The P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays an essential role in CVB3-induced diseases. We previously demonstrated microRNA-21 has potential inhibitory effect on the MAP2K3 which locates upstream of P38 MAPK and was upregulated in mouse hearts upon CVB3 infection. However, the effect and underlying mechanism of miRNA-21 on CVB3 infection remain unclear. We detected continuous changes of cellular miRNA-21 and P38 MAPK proteins expression profiling post CVB3 infection in vitro within 12 h. P38 MAPK signaling was inhibited by the specific inhibitor, small interfering RNA and miRNA-21 mimic in vitro, CVB3 replication, cell apoptosis rate and proliferation were detected. Viral load in the mice heart, cardiomyocyte apoptosis rate and histological of the heart were also detected in the mice model of viral myocarditis pretreated with miRNA-21-lentivirus. We observed significant upregulation of miRNA-21 expression followed by suppression of the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling in CVB3-infected Hela cells. The inactivation of the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling by P38 MAPK specific inhibitor, small interfering RNA against MAP2K3, or miRNA-21 overexpression significantly inhibited viral progeny release from CVB3-infected cells. Mechanistically, when compared with control miRNA, miRNA-21 showed no effect on capsid protein VP1 expression and viral load within host cells, while significantly reversing CVB3-induced caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis rate, further promoting proliferation of infected cells, which indicates the inhibitory effect of miRNA-21 on CVB3 progeny release. In the in vivo study, when compared with control miRNA, miRNA-21 pretreatment remarkably inactivated the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling in mice and protected them against CVB3 infection as evidenced by significantly alleviated cell apoptosis rate, reduced viral titers, necrosis in the heart as well as by remarkably prolonged survival time. Conclusions: miRNA-21 were reverse correlated with P38 MAPK activation post CVB3 infection, miRNA-21 overexpression significantly inhibited viral progeny release and decreased myocytes apoptosis rate in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that miRNA-21 may serve as a potential therapeutic agent against CVB3 infection through targeting the MAP2K3/P38 MAPK signaling.

da28d9bb7fc7bcc86543c2be2a04ffafba39344c	In the present work, we outline a set of coarse-grain analytical models that can be used by decision-makers to bound the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific communities with known or estimated social contact structure and to assess the effects of various non-pharmaceutical interventions on slowing the progression of disease spread. This work provides a multi-dimensional view of the problem by examining steady-state and dynamic disease spread using a network-based approach. In addition, Bayesian-based estimation procedures are used to provide a realistic assessment of the severity of outbreaks based on estimates of the average and instantaneous basic reproduction number R 0 .

Quercetin is flavonoid that occurs naturally in plants and is widely used as a nutritional supplement due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated antioxidant activities and mechanisms of action in zymosan-induced macrophages of quercetin and quercetin-related flavonoids such as quercitrin, isoquercitrin, quercetin 3-O-β-(2′′-galloyl)rhamnopyranoside (QGR) and quercetin 3-O-β-(2′′-galloyl)glucopyranoside (QGG) as well as gallic acid, a building moiety of QGR and QGG. QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities compared with quercetin, whereas quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid exhibited weak-tono antioxidant activities, assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, superoxide production, superoxide scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) production, peroxynitrite (ONOO -) scavenging and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Regarding mechanisms, the quercetincontaining flavonoids QGR and QGG differentially targeted compared with quercetin in the NF-κB signaling pathway that inhibited the DNA binding activity of the NF-κB complex without affecting the degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB phosphorylation. In addition, QGR and QGG inhibited CRE and activator protein (AP-1) transcriptional activity and JNK phosphorylation by inhibiting the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in a different manner than quercetin. Our results showed that although QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities than querce-tin in macrophages, their mechanisms of action in terms of the NF-κB, PKA and PKC signaling pathways were different. al.,
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved catabolic process that allows for the degradation of intracellular components by lysosomes. This process can be triggered by nutrient deprivation, microbial infections or other challenges to promote cell survival under these stressed conditions. However, basal levels of autophagy are also crucial for the maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis by ensuring the selective removal of protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles. A tight regulation of this process is essential for cellular survival and organismal health. Indeed, deregulation of autophagy is associated with a broad range of pathologies such as neuronal degeneration, inflammatory diseases, and cancer progression. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination of autophagy substrates, as well as components of the autophagic machinery, are critical regulatory mechanisms of autophagy. Here, we review the main evidence implicating deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in the regulation of autophagy. We also discuss how they may constitute new therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of pathologies such as cancers, neurodegenerative diseases or infections. Cells 2018, 7, 112 2 of 24 conformation or the activity of the targeted protein or direct proteins for degradation by either the proteasome or the autophagy process [16, 17] . Ubiquitin linkage is involved in most, if not all, cellular processes and signaling pathways. As for autophagy, defects in ubiquitination and deregulation of DUBs are associated with human disorders [18] [19] [20] . Here, we chose to focus on the role of DUBs related to the regulation of autophagy and cargo lysosomal degradation. We extended our review to the recent development of small-molecule inhibitors modulating DUBs' activity on autophagy, thus highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Autophagy and Ubiquitin System: A Brief Overview Autophagy was first described in 1966 by C. de Duve and R. Wattiaux based on observations from mammalian cells deprived of serum and amino acids [21] . The name autophagy was coined later, after electron microscopy observations that revealed the presence of double-membrane vesicles containing part of the cytoplasm. Autophagy can be induced in response to various stressors such as lack of nutrients or growth factors, hypoxia, or infection [22] . As such, autophagy was initially described as a survival mechanism in response to various stresses. However, it is now widely recognized that basal levels of autophagy also operate independently of any stress, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by the removal of dysfunctional or unnecessary proteins and organelles (for instance, mitochondria) and ribosomes [2] . One can distinguish three types of autophagy: macroautophagy (mostly referred to as autophagy), chaperone-mediated autophagy and microautophagy. These autophagy processes differ by the way substrates are being delivered to the lysosome for degradation. In macroautophagy, autophagy substrates are isolated from the cytoplasm through their engulfment in double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes [23] . Autophagosomes are formed by the elongation of an isolation membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum [24] . The autophagosomes eventually mature and fuse with the lysosomes where hydrolases degrade the substrates (Figure 1 ). In chaperone-mediated autophagy, soluble cytosolic proteins are recruited by the chaperone HSC70/HSP8A and directly translocated into the lysosome through pores made of LAMP2A multimers. Substrate translocation into the lysosome requires a second HSC70 chaperone resident in the lysosomal lumen [25] [26] [27] . In microautophagy, cytosolic substrates are transferred to the lysosome through direct invagination of the lysosomal membrane (in yeast) or from the late endosomes (in mammals and Drosophila, referred to as endosomal-microautophagy) that eventually fuse with the lysosomes [28] [29] [30] . As for chaperone-mediated autophagy, endosomal-microautophagy requires the chaperone protein HSC70 for the selection of the substrates [28, 30, 31] . The major components of the autophagy machinery are the ATG (autophagy-related gene) proteins, which are required for the formation and maturation of the autophagosome (Figure 1 ). ATG proteins form specific macromolecular complexes acting at several steps of autophagosome formation and regulating different stages of the autophagy process [23] . Autophagy induction by starvation is controlled by the TOR (target of rapamycin) complex 1, which is an essential signaling pathway for the sensing of nutrient availability [32] . Lack of nutrients leads to the down-regulation of TOR activity, resulting in the activation of the ULK1/ATG1 complex. The activation of the ULK1 complex then initiates autophagy by recruiting other ATG proteins to the nascent autophagosome. Downstream ULK1 complex, the class III PtdIns3K (PI3K-III) complex, is responsible for the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), which triggers the proper localization and membrane association of other ATG proteins [33] . Beclin1, a multivalent adaptor, is one major component of the PI3K-III complex. The expansion of the autophagosomal membrane requires two ubiquitin-like conjugation cascades: the Atg12-conjugation system and the Atg8/LC3-conjugation system. The modification of the Atg8 protein by lipidation and its anchorage in the autophagosome membrane is a hallmark of autophagy induction [34] [35] [36] . After completion and closure, the autophagosome is Cells 2018, 7, 112 3 of 24 targeted to and fuses with the lysosome, leading to the degradation of its content. Posttranslational modifications on autophagy regulators contribute to the rapid and efficient response to various stresses. If attention is focused first on phosphorylation, a growing body of evidence shows that ubiquitination also plays a crucial role in the dynamic regulation of autophagy notably by targeting substrates to autophagosome, and modifying the activity of ULK1 and PI3K-III complexes [11, 37, 38] .

f2ff483d3cf8f491141f9cc2e3a26dddacd41b5d	Background: A novel influenza A virus, subtype H1N1 of swine-lineage (H1N1 swl) has transmitted rapidly to many regions of the world with evidence of sustained transmission within some countries. Rapid detection and differentiation from seasonal influenza is essential to instigate appropriate patient and public health management and for disease surveillance. Objectives: To develop a rapid and sensitive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for confirmation of H1N1 swl. Study design: A one-step rtRT-PCR approach was employed to target the matrix gene of the novel influenza A/H1N1 swl and validated against a panel of seasonal influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), swine influenza A/H1N1 and avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses. The assay following validation was then used prospectively to detect H1N1 swl positive specimens from the recent outbreaks in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Results: The one-step H1N1 swl matrix rtRT-PCR successfully detected H1N1 swl clinical specimens and did not cross-react with seasonal influenza A, subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and swine influenza A (H1N1). The H1N1 swl matrix assay did cross react with H5N1. The H1N1 swl matrix assay was then compared to two other assays using a dilution series and a panel of untyped influenza A positive clinical samples. These experiments found the assay to have a comparable sensitivity to the established universal influenza A rtRT-PCR and was more sensitive than the H1N1 swl specific assay that targeted the H1 region. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the rtRT-PCR is sensitive and should be used alongside existing universal influenza A assays to rapidly detect the novel H1N1 swl virus.

3a24f34693d064d96d48ce3c7a69b2d125127394	Background: Wheezing illnesses among young children are common and are a risk factor for asthma. However, determinants of childhood bronchial reactivity, a key feature of asthma, are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine how patient characteristics during the first severe virus-induced wheezing episode are associated with pulmonary function at preschool age. Methods: Study consisted of 76 children presenting with their first wheezing episode at the ages of 3 to 23 months. At study entry, viral etiology, rhinovirus genome load, atopic and clinical characteristics, and standardized questionnaire were analyzed. At 4-year follow-up visit, impulse oscillometry with exercise challenge was performed. Results: At study entry, the mean age of the children was 12 months (SD 6.0), 57 (75%) were rhinovirus positive, and 22 (30%) were sensitized. At follow-up visit four years later, the mean age of the children was 60 months (SD 7.9) and 37 (49%) were using asthma medication regularly (discontinued before testing in 25 [68%] children). Bronchial reactivity (≥35% change in mean crude values of resistance) after exercise challenge or bronchodilation was present in nine (12%) children. Children with atopic sensitization at the time of the first wheezing episode were more often likely to develop bronchial reactivity (odds ratio 8.8, P = 0.03)

Electrohydrodynamic inkjet (EHD) printing is a potential method to effectively fabricate micro scale PDMS devices because EHD printing is environment-friendly, low-cost, compatible to various inks, and most importantly, high resolution. However, little research has been conducted to study EHD printing of PDMS-based ink. In this paper, EHD printing of PDMS has been investigated. The effects of several critical parameters on the printing process were studied. The dimension of the printed patterns and the printing frequency were preciously controlled by the voltage parameters. The patterns with a network structure was demonstrated. The results indicated that the voltage amplitude and the pulse frequency could both control the dimensions of droplets and the printing frequency.

d38e5f2006c9a906fc1427aafd8f0f05ee869470	Yersinia Pestis Outer proteins, plasminogen activator protease and Yop secretion protein F are necessary for the full virulence of Yesinia pestis and have been proposed as potential protective antigens for vaccines against plague. In the current study, we used DNA immunization as a tool to study the relative protective immunity of these proteins with a standardized intranasal challenge system in mice. While the natural full length gene sequences for most of these Y. pestis proteins did not display a good level of protein expression in vitro when delivered by a DNA vaccine vector, the overall immunogenicity of these wild type gene DNA vaccines was low in eliciting antigen-specific antibody responses and gene sequence modifications improved both of these parameters. However, even modified YopD, YopO and YscF antigens were only able to partially protect immunized mice at various levels against lethal challenge with Y. pestis KIM 1001 strain while no protection was observed with either the YopB or Pla antigens. These results demonstrate that DNA immunization is effective in screening, optimizing and comparing optimal antigen designs and immunogenicity of candidate antigens for the development of a subunit-based plague vaccine.
ef395bb81012eacc7628d0425be9a3a46a8ada9b	Background: As the number of suspected and confirmed COVID19 cases in the US continues to rise, the US surgeon general, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and several specialty societies have issued recommendations to consider canceling elective surgeries. However, these recommendations have also faced controversy and opposition. Objective: The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis and model for preventable COVID19 infections from elective outpatient or ambulatory surgery cases, which can also be adapted to analyze COVID19 transmission in other healthcare settings. Furthermore, given the controversy over the appropriate handling of elective surgical cases during this pandemic, we hope that our results may have a positive impact on health policy and public health. Methods: Using previously published information on elective ambulatory or outpatient surgical procedures and publicly available data on COVID19 infections in the US and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we calculated a transmission rate and generated a mathematical model to predict a lower bound for the number of healthcare-acquired COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling or postponing elective outpatient surgeries in Washington state. Results: Our model predicts that over the course of 30 days, at least 2445 preventable patient infections and at least 1557 preventable healthcare worker (HCW) infections would occur in WA state alone if elective outpatient procedures were to continue as usual. The majority of these infections are caused by transmission from HCW who became infected at work.
7369be07ea47a7e60832bb8d2eead1ed1116b171	Background COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic. Changes in haematological characteristics in patients with COVID-19 are emerging as important features of the disease. We aimed to explore the haematological characteristics and related risk factors in patients with COVID-19. Methods This retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to three designated sites of Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease (defined according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia, trial version 7, published by the National Health Commission of China). We assessed the risk factors associated with critical illness and poor prognosis. Dynamic haematological and coagulation parameters were investigated with a linear mixed model, and coagulopathy screening with sepsis-induced coagulopathy and International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis overt disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring systems was applied. Of 466 patients admitted to hospital from Jan 23 to Feb 23, 2020, 380 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study. The incidence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 × 10⁹ cells per L) in patients with critical disease (42 [49%] of 86) was significantly higher than in those with severe (20 [14%] of 145) or moderate (nine [6%] of 149) disease (p<0·0001). The numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils were signifi cantly lower in patients with critical disease than those with severe or moderate disease (p<0·0001), and prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrin degradation products significantly increased with increasing disease severity (p<0·0001). In multivariate analyses, death was associated with increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (≥9·13; odds ratio [OR] 5·39 [95% CI 1·70-17·13], p=0·0042), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 × 10⁹ per L; OR 8·33 [2·56-27·15], p=0·00045), prolonged prothrombin time (>16 s; OR 4·94 [1·50-16·25], p=0·0094), and increased D-dimer (>2 mg/L; OR 4·41 [1·06-18·30], p=0·041). Thrombotic and haemorrhagic events were common complications in patients who died (19 [35%] of 55). Sepsisinduced coagulopathy and International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis overt disseminated intravascular coagulation scores (assessed in 12 patients who survived and eight patients who died) increased over time in patients who died. The onset of sepsis-induced coagulopathy was typically before overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. Interpretation Rapid blood tests, including platelet count, prothrombin time, D-dimer, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio can help clinicians to assess severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The sepsis-induced coagulopathy scoring system can be used for early assessment and management of patients with critical disease.
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	Based on microRNA (miR) microarray analysis, we previously found that miR22-5p expression is decreased in the mid-luteal endometrium of women with minimal/mild endometriosis. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR22-5p targets ten-eleven translocation (TET2) 3 0 -untranslated region. This study aimed to determine the regulation and roles of miR22-5p in the pathogenesis of minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility. MiR22-5p and TET2 expression in the mid-luteal endometrium from women with or without minimal/mild endometriosis was analyzed. After transfection with miR22-5p mimics or inhibitor, TET2 expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription (RT-q) PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine was determined by immunofluorescence and dot blotting. Expression and promoter methylation of estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) was measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting, and by bisulfite sequencing, respectively. We first established that miR22-5p expression decreased and TET2 expression increased in minimal/mild endometriosis during implantation window. TET2 was found to be a direct target of miR22-5p. MiR22-5p regulated the expression of ESR2, but did not directly affect methylation of its promoter region (-197/+359). Our results suggest that an imbalance in miR22-5p expression in the midluteal endometrium may be involved in minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility. Tan J, et al. (2020) MicroRNA22-5p targets teneleven translocation and regulates estrogen receptor 2 expression in infertile women with minimal/mild endometriosis during implantation window.

Data Availability Statement: All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files. implantation [2] [3] [4] ; however, the association between infertility and early-stage disease (minimal [stage I] and mild [stage II] endometriosis), in which no substantial pelvic anatomical changes are identified, remains controversial [4] [5] [6] . Endometrial receptivity is defined as a restricted period in the menstrual cycle during which the uterus is receptive to blastocyst attachment and implantation [7] . Innate pathology in the eutopic endometrium is suggested to contribute to implantation impairment in women with endometriosis with subfertility [8-10]. Progesterone resistance results in inadequate antagonism of estrogen action, increased inflammation, inadequate differentiation of the stroma, and remodeling of the endometrium, all of which can lead to a non-receptive endometrium for embryo implantation [11] . mRNA and protein levels of estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) are significantly elevated in endometriotic cells as compared to normal stromal cells, whereas estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), total progesterone receptor (PGR), and progesterone receptor B (PGR B) are repressed [12] . Increased ESR2 levels are directly related to ESR2 promoter hypomethylation in endometriotic cells [12, 13] . ESR2 represses ESR1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, which can result in progesterone resistance [12, 13] . However, the complete repertoire of ESR2 functions is believed to be more complicated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate protein expression via translational inhibition or mRNA degradation. Emerging data suggest that dysregulation of miRNA expression may be implicated in the development and pathogenesis of endometriosis [14] . Using microarray-based miRNA profiling, we previously found that 66 mature miRNAs were differentially expressed (54 up-and 12 downregulated) in mid-luteal eutopic endometrium from women with minimal/mild endometriosis as compared with normal endometrial tissues [15] . Specifically, miR-196a upregulated MEK/ERK signaling and mediated repressed PGR expression and decidualization of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) from eutopic endometrium with endometriosis [15] . Likewise, upregulation of miR-194-3p in eutopic endometrium inhibited PGR expression and ESC decidualization in endometriosis, which hinders fertility by repressing the levels of PGR and decidualization in the eutopic endometrium [16] . We have also shown that miR23a and miRNA23b are downregulated in endometriosis and they upregulate several unidentified genes required for Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) expression in ESCs [17] . Bioinformatics analysis of a downregulated miRNA, miR22-5p, revealed a binding site in the 3 0 -untranslated region (3 0 -UTR) of ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) [18] . The TET family encodes enzymes responsible for the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hmC in DNA demethylation. Genome-wide analysis of endometriomas revealed significantly low TET gene expression associated with high 5-hmC levels upon in-vitro decidualization, suggesting a unique epigenetic regulation in these ectopic tissues [19] . However, how TET2 affects minimal/mild endometriosis-related infertility and the specific mechanism are unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate miR22-5p expression and the relationship between miR22-5p and TET2 expression in mid-luteal eutopic endometrium of infertile women with and without minimal/mild endometriosis using tissues and primary ESCs. Material and methods This study was approved by the Medical Research Review Board of West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University, and written informed consent for participation was obtained from all participants. In total, 50 infertile women aged 22-34 years old with regular menstrual cycles were enrolled in this study between January 2015 and May 2018. Normal endometrium was obtained from 24 infertile women without endometrial pathology, and eutopic endometrium was obtained from 26 infertile women with a laparoscopic and histological diagnosis of stage I-II PLOS ONE miR22-5p targets TET2 and regulates ESR2 in minimal/mild endometriosis PLOS ONE | https://doi.

7f5ef8185f8934ab5b5eb4344dad20da84d104a3	Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently discovered in children with respiratory distress and/or diarrhea. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported the existence of bocavirus in Saudi Arabia. Swabs samples from 80 children with respiratory tract infections were examined for the presence of HBoV. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used as a sensitive method to detect the HBoV. Direct gene sequencing was used to determine the genotype of the detected virus isolates. HBoV was detected in 22.5% of the examined patients. The NP1 partial gene sequence from all patients showed that the circulated strains were related to HBoV-1 genotype. Most of HBoV infected patients showed evidence of mixed coinfection with other viral pathogens. The current study clearly demonstrated that genetically conserved HBoV1 circulates in Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, most of the HBoV1 infected cases were associated with high rates of co-infections with other viruses.

9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	Background. The time delay between the start of an influenza pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning. We quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay, and assess how the delay may be extended by non-pharmaceutical interventions. Methods and Findings. The model constructed for this time delay accounts for: (i) epidemic growth in the source region, (ii) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at-risk country, (iii) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders, (iv) the possibility of in-flight transmission, (v) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic, and (vi) the delay until infection in the at-risk country gathers momentum. Efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic, and under favourable circumstances, could add several months to the delay. On the other hand, the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection, wearing a protective mask during travel, promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks. Elevated in-flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally. Conclusions. The delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at-risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at-risk country, and is little affected by nonpharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers. Short of preventing international travel altogether, eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country-to-country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza.
bd9162d8379baef31b50aa17a7f553740aa28ba2	Background: Whole genome sequence data is a step towards generating the 'parts list' of life to understand the underlying principles of Biocomplexity. Genome sequencing initiatives of human and model organisms are targeted efforts towards understanding principles of evolution with an application envisaged to improve human health. These efforts culminated in the development of dedicated resources. Whereas a large number of viral genomes have been sequenced by groups or individuals with an interest to study antigenic variation amongst strains and species. These independent efforts enabled viruses to attain the status of 'best-represented taxa' with the highest number of genomes. However, due to lack of concerted efforts, viral genomic sequences merely remained as entries in the public repositories until recently. Results: VirGen is a curated resource of viral genomes and their analyses. Since its first release, it has grown both in terms of coverage of viral families and development of new modules for annotation and analysis. The current release (2.0) includes data for twenty-five families with broad host range as against eight in the first release. The taxonomic description of viruses in VirGen is in accordance with the ICTV nomenclature. A wellcharacterised strain is identified as a 'representative entry' for every viral species. This non-redundant dataset is used for subsequent annotation and analyses using sequenced-based Bioinformatics approaches. VirGen archives precomputed data on genome and proteome comparisons. A new data module that provides structures of viral proteins available in PDB has been incorporated recently. One of the unique features of VirGen is predicted conformational and sequential epitopes of known antigenic proteins using in-house developed algorithms, a step towards reverse vaccinology. Conclusion: Structured organization of genomic data facilitates use of data mining tools, which provides opportunities for knowledge discovery. One of the approaches to achieve this goal is to carry out functional annotations using comparative genomics. VirGen, a comprehensive viral genome resource that serves as an annotation and analysis pipeline has been developed for the curation of public domain viral genome data http:// bioinfo.ernet.in/virgen/virgen.html. Various steps in the curation and annotation of the genomic data and applications of the value-added derived data are substantiated with case studies.
584690fd413d25e55ee5599071bd23b1be00add0	Nosocomial transmission is an important characteristic of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Risk factors for transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings are not well defined. During the Korean outbreak in 2015, 186 patients had laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Those suspected as a source of viral transmission were categorized into the spreader groups (super-spreader [n = 5] and usualspreader [n = 10]) and compared to the non-spreader group (n = 171). Body temperature of ≥ 38.5°C (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-22.30; P = 0.016), pulmonary infiltration of ≥ 3 lung zones (aOR, 7.33; 95% CI, 1.93-27.79; P = 0.003) , and a more nonisolated in-hospital days (aOR, 1.32 per 1 day; 95% CI, 1.09-1.60; P = 0.004) were significant risk factors in the spreader group. There was no different clinical factor between super-spreaders and usual-spreaders. Nonisolated in-hospital days was the only factor which tended to be higher in super-spreaders than usual-spreaders (Mean, 6.6 vs. 2.9 days; P = 0.061). Early active quarantine might help reducing the size of an outbreak.
145ff88ddac18ba5a5b71105a918c37cab6ff7e2	Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that COVID-19 causes adverse outcomes in ethnic minority groups. However, little is known about the impact of ethnicity and household size on acquiring infection with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We undertook a retrospective cohort study, in Leicester (UK), of all individuals assessed for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust between 1st March and 28th April 2020. We used logistic regression to identify sociodemographic, clinical and temporal factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity before/after lockdown. Findings: 971/4051 (24.0%) patients with suspected COVID-19 were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. PCR positivity was more common amongst individuals from ethnic minortiy backgrounds than their White counterparts (White 20.0%, South Asian 37.5%, Black 36.1%, Other 32.2%; p<0.001 for all ethnic minority groups vs White). After adjustment, compared to White ethnicity, South Asian (aOR 2.44 95%CI 2.01, 2.97), Black (aOR 2.56 95%CI 1.71, 3.84) and Other (aOR 2.53 95%CI 1.74, 3.70) ethnicities were more likely to test positive, as were those with a larger estimated household size (aOR 1.06 95%CI 1.02, 1.11). We saw increasing proportions of positive tests in the three weeks post-lockdown amongst the ethnic minority , but not the White, cohort. Estimated household size was associated with PCR positivity after, but not before, lockdown (aOR 1.10 95%CI 1.03, 1.16). Interpretation: In individuals presenting with suspected COVID-19, those from ethnic minority communities and larger households had an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. Pandemic control measures may have more rapid impact on slowing viral transmission amongst those of White ethnicity compared to ethnic minority groups, Research is urgently required to understand the mechanisms underlying these dis-
321a5877c7371f56ec49eedb54f75f504f130e8a	The proposed doses of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment of COVID-19 (1000 mg/day for 10 days, CQ; 800 mg first day then 400 mg/day for 5 days, HCQ) in many guidelines worldwide, are considerably higher than the maximum recommended daily safe doses of both agents ( 2.3 mg/kg/day, CQ; 5.0 mg/kg/day, HCQ) for development of retinal toxicity. Irreversible retinal damage can occur if the exposure to the safe doses is >5 years. It is not known whether exposure to high doses over a short period of time can also cause the damage. We recommend that before prescribing CQ or HCQ, history of ocular disease should be obtained to avoid the prescription if appropriate. If either agent is to be used, routine baseline ocular examination is not absolutely necessary. Patients who do not have ocular disease should also be informed about the potential risk of retinal toxicity. Both agents, however, have not yet been proven to be beneficial to COVID-19.
03e70a448d7fd2324949ab321c571ceeb13b452e	R, and others have reported on asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at the familial level. 1-3 We also note multiple reports of SARS-CoV-2-associated superspreading events (SSEs) arising from mass gatherings; however, the extent of transmission from asymptomatic carriers at these events has not been characterized. 4,5 Observational studies reporting a high household secondary attack rate and modest R 0 suggest a transmission dynamic biased toward SSEs. 6 The presence of asymptomatic carriers could have implications for how relevant authorities handle mass gatherings. We report on two separate settings with presumptive asymptomatic carrier transmission in Brunei Darussalam that can be traced to a single mass gathering in Malaysia. From February 28 to March 2, 2020, a religious event was held at the Seri Petaling Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, that was later determined to be an international SSE. 5 This event, now known as the Tablighi Jamaat cluster, was attended by 16 000 people including 75 persons from Brunei, of whom 19 were subsequently confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 on return from Malaysia. These resulted in a further 52 locally transmitted cases. We reviewed medical and outbreak investigation records of five cases of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) who were part of the Brunei branch of the Tablighi cluster. For diagnosis, nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were collected and tested using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On admission, all patients underwent routine blood tests and chest X-ray. Patients were discharged following resolution of symptoms, and negative RT-PCR results from two consecutive NP samples collected at ≥24-hour intervals. This study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee. Patient A1 (presumed asymptomatic carrier in household setting) is a 30-year-old man. On February 27, he traveled to Malaysia to attend the Tablighi event and returned to Brunei on March 3. Following detection of the country's first COVID-19 case and the subsequent identification of the Tablighi cluster, all participants of that event who returned to Brunei were tested. His NP sample taken on March 10 was positive by RT-PCR, and he was admitted to the National Isolation Centre. He was asymptomatic on admission and remained so throughout (Figure 1). His blood investigations and chest X-ray were normal. RT-PCR was still positive on March 24, and negative on March 26 and 27. All 7 household contacts were tested on March 12, out of which two were found positive. Patient A2 (wife, aged 32) and patient A3 (daughter, aged 10 months) denied any travel or other relevant contact history. Patient A2 reported rhinorrhea which began on March 9; however, this had resolved on presentation. She was asymptomatic throughout her admission. Patient A3 was observed by her mother to have a mild cough starting on March 11, and however was afebrile and had no symptoms on and throughout admission. Patient B1 (presumed asymptomatic carrier in school setting) is a 13-year-old girl. She is an asymptomatic household contact of her father, who was a participant at the same Tablighi event in Malaysia. Her father was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 on March 11, and as a contact, her NP sample was collected that same day. She tested positive and was admitted to NIC. She was asymptomatic on presentation and remained so throughout admission (Figure 1). Her blood investigations and chest X-ray were normal. RT-PCR was positive on March 27 and negative on March 29 and 30. Contact tracing for case B1 identified 29 school contacts, all of whom were tested. Among them, her class teacher (patient B2, 39-year-old female) tested positive on March 12. On admission on March 14, patient B2 reported a mild cough which resolved the next day and has had no further symptoms since. We report two different settings where the sequence of events is highly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by asymptomatic carriers, both with clear epidemiological links to a single mass gathering-the Tablighi event. We document how this event has led to at least two further generations due to asymptomatic spread. As far as we are aware, this is the first such report documenting the role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the propagation of a large superspreading event. These findings have two key implications. First, cases without symptoms suggest silent chains of transmission. These cases are harder to detect, as they are less likely to present to healthcare facilities, and many testing criteria require the presence of symptoms. 7, 8 Our findings support implementation of testing and longitudinal surveillance of close contacts in the absence of symptoms. This is particularly important if we aim to "find, isolate, test, and treat every case to break the chains of COVID transmission." 9 This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) have been reported to use aminopeptidase N (APN) as a cellular receptor. Recently, the role of APN as a receptor for PEDV has been questioned. In our study, the role of APN in PEDV and TGEV infections was studied in primary porcine enterocytes. After seven days of cultivation, 89% of enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two-to five-fold higher susceptibility to PEDV and TGEV. A significant increase of PEDV and TGEV infection was correlated with a higher expression of APN, which was indicative that APN plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections. However, PEDV and TGEV infected both APN positive and negative enterocytes. PEDV and TGEV Miller showed a higher infectivity in APN positive cells than in APN negative cells. In contrast, TGEV Purdue replicated better in APN negative cells. These results show that an additional receptor exists, different from APN for porcine coronaviruses. Subsequently, treatment of enterocytes with neuraminidase (NA) had no effect on infection efficiency of TGEV, implying that terminal cellular sialic acids (SAs) are no receptor determinants for TGEV. Treatment of TGEV with NA significantly enhanced the infection which shows that TGEV is masked by SAs. Viruses 2020, 12, 402 2 of 18 the corona-like appearance of viral particles. It contains an N-terminal ectodomain (S1) and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (S2). It is known that the peripheral S1 portion is a globular cellular receptor binding subunit while the transmembrane S2 portion is required to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes [1] . The S protein also contains important antigenic determinants for coronaviruses. The triple-spanning M protein has a short N-terminal glycosylated domain, a long C-terminal domain, and three transmembrane domains [2] . M proteins play key roles in virion assembly/budding. The lateral interactions between M and E proteins are supposed to mediate the formation of the virion envelope. The M-S protein interactions are also needed to retain the spike proteins at the budding site, incorporating the S proteins into the viral envelope [3] . The E protein is a small hydrophobic protein of 9-12 kDa. It plays crucial roles during virus budding and transiently localizes at the pre-Golgi compartment before progressing to the Golgi apparatus. Deletion of the E protein in TGEV arrests virus transportation and maturation [4] . The E protein possesses an ion channel activity, contributing to virus virulence and pathogenesis [5] . The replication of viruses in their host cells is firstly mediated by the virus binding to the cellular receptors. Some Alphacoronaviruses, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), TGEV, and PEDV, may use aminopeptidase N (APN) as a cellular receptor [6-10]. APN is a type II cell membrane metalloprotease, that is linked to cells by its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. It is highly abundant on the brush border membrane of the mature small intestinal enterocytes, kidney, and liver epithelial cells. APN is highly species specific. Human coronaviruses cannot recognize porcine APN as a cellular receptor because of certain differences in glycosylation regions [11] . APN has been identified as a major receptor for TGEV, as it has been shown that TGEV virions are able to specifically bind to purified APN and conferred the infectivity of TGEV to a non-permissive cell line when the cells were expressing recombinant APN [7] . An interaction between APN and PEDV infection has also been demonstrated. Transient expression of APN in Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells conferred susceptibility of these cells to PEDV infection and the infection was inhibited by anti-APN polyclonal antibodies [9] . Cong and colleagues demonstrated that APN mediates PEDV infection in Vero E6 and in an immortalized porcine enteric cell line [12] . However, increasingly more data demonstrates that APN is not essential for PEDV infection, because PEDV exhibits no binding to soluble APN [13, 14] . Moreover, Vero cells are commonly used for PEDV propagation and cultivation in vitro. The endogenous expression of APN in Vero cells was undetectable in the mRNA and the protein levels, which challenges the role of APN as a cellular receptor for PEDV. Therefore, whether APN is a functional receptor for PEDV is disputable. However, no data are available on the role of APN in primary enterocytes. In addition to APN, a sialic acid binding capacity has been reported for TGEV and PEDV [15, 16] . Sialic acids are electronegatively charged monosaccharides in animals and some microorganisms. They are prominently positioned at the outer end of N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycosphingolipids. TGEV shows a hemagglutinating activity with α-2,3-linked sialic acids on the erythrocyte surface as target. Among different types of sialic acids, N-glycolylneuraminic acid was recognized by TGEV more efficiently than N-acetylneuraminic acid [15] . Sialic acid binding by TGEV is not essential in the initiation of infection of cultured cells, as TGEV mutants lacking sialic acid binding activity can be propagated to the same extent in cultured cells [15] . However, sialic acid binding activity is important for the enteropathogenicity of TGEV. Mutants without sialic acid binding were not capable of initiating intestinal infection in vivo, showing that sialic acid binding is required for efficient intestinal infections [17] . This sialic acid binding activity of TGEV is supposed to help the virus to penetrate the mucus layer and to infect intestinal epithelial cells. PEDV is also able to bind sialic acids. PEDV S1 protein was reported to bind bovine and porcine mucins that contain a mixture of different types of sugar [16, 18] . Furthermore, Neu5Ac was identified as the most favored binding sugar of PEDV S1 by a glycan array screen [16] . Different from the APN binding domain in the C-terminal of PEDV S1 (residues 477-629), the sialic acid binding domain was reported in the N-terminal of PEDV S1 (residues 1-320) [18] .
7a7c1c991ee3905b06ca628a523f693a402cc7f1	Background: Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a poorly understood disease with no known treatments. We describe the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV at a regional referral center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methods: In 2014, a retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of MERS-CoV to determine clinical and treatment characteristics associated with death. Confounding was evaluated and a multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the independent effect of treatments administered. Results: Fifty-one patients had an overall mortality of 37 %. Most patients were male (78 %) with a mean age of 54 years. Almost a quarter of the patients were healthcare workers (23.5 %) and 41 % had a known exposure to another person with MERS-CoV. Survival was associated with male gender, working as a healthcare worker, history of hypertension, vomiting on admission, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal lung exam, elevated alanine transaminase (ALT), clearance of MERS-CoV on repeat PCR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and mycophenolate mofetil treatment. Survival was reduced in the presence of coronary artery disease, hypotension, hypoxemia, CXR (chest X-ray) abnormalities, leukocytosis, creatinine >1 · 5 mg/dL, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure. In a multivariate analysis of treatments administered, severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival. Conclusions: Care for patients with MERS-CoV remains a challenge. In this retrospective cohort, interferon beta and mycophenolate mofetil treatment were predictors of increased survival in the univariate analysis. Severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival in the multivariate analysis. Larger randomized trials are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of these treatment regimens for MERS-CoV.
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	We administered an adenoviral vector, Onyx-015, into the hepatic artery of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer involving the liver. Thirty-five patients enrolled in this multi-institutional phase I/II trial received up to eight arterial infusions of up to 2 Â 10 12 viral particles. Hepatic toxicity was the primary dose-limiting toxicity observed in preclinical models. However, nearly 200 infusions of this adenoviral vector were administered directly into the hepatic artery without significant toxicity. Therefore, we undertook this analysis to determine the impact of repeated adenoviral exposure on hepatic function. Seventeen patients were treated at our institution, providing a detailed data set on the changes in hepatic function following repeated exposure to adenovirus. No changes in hepatic function occurred with the first treatment of Onyx-015 among these patients. Transient increases in transaminase levels occurred in one patient starting with the second infusion and transient increases in bilirubin was observed in two patients starting with the fifth treatment. These changes occurred too early to be explained by viral-mediated lysis of hepatocytes. In addition, viremia was observed starting 3-5 days after the viral infusion in half of the patient, but was not associated with hepatic toxicity. To further understand the basis for the minimal hepatic toxicity of adenoviral vectors, we evaluated the replication of adenovirus in primary hepatocytes and tumor cells in culture and the expression of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) in normal liver and colon cancer metastatic to the liver. We found that adenovirus replicates poorly in primary hepatocytes but replicates efficiently in tumors including tumors derived from hepatocytes. In addition, we found that CAR is localized at junctions between hepatocytes and is inaccessible to hepatic blood flow. CAR is not expressed on tumor vasculature but is expressed on tumor cells. Spatial restriction of CAR to the intercellular space in normal liver and diminished replication of adenovirus in hepatocytes may explain the minimal toxicity observed following repeated hepatic artery infusions with Onyx-015.

bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the primary cause of bronchopneumonia in infants and children worldwide. Clinical studies have shown that early treatments of RSV patients with ribavirin improve prognosis, even if the use of this drug is limited due to myelosuppression and toxicity effects. Furthermore, effective vaccines to prevent RSV infection are currently unavailable. Thus, the development of highly effective and specific antiviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of RSV infections is a compelling need. In the quest of new RSV inhibitors, in this work we evaluated the antiviral activity of a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives in cell-based assays. Several 1-and 2-phenyl-benzotriazoles resulted fairly potent (µM concentrations) inhibitors of RSV infection in plaque reduction assays, accompanied by low cytotoxicity in human highly dividing T lymphoid-derived cells and primary cell lines. Contextually, no inhibitory effects were observed against other RNA or DNA viruses assayed, suggesting specific activity against RSV. Further results revealed that the lead compound 10d was active during the early phase of the RSV infection cycle. To understand whether 10d interfered with virus attachment to target cells or virus-cell fusion events, inhibitory activity tests against the RSV mutant strain B1 cp-52-expressing only the F envelope glycoprotein-and a plasmid-based reporter assay that quantifies the bioactivity of viral entry were also performed. The overall biological results, in conjunction with in silico modeling studies, supported the conclusion that the RSV fusion process could be the target of this new series of compounds.
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	Background: Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains have recently come into existence worldwide; however, researchers in northeast China are not aware of their clinical features and molecular characteristics. Methods: Here, the molecular and virulent characteristics of 44 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates collected from January 2015 to December 2017 were studied. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were carried out to define the clonal relatedness among the isolates. PCR and capsular serotyping of the virulence-associated genes, as well as biofilm formation and serum complement-mediated killing assays, were employed to determine the virulent potential. The genomic features and associated mobile genetic elements of JmsCRE57 were detected by whole genome sequencing. Results: The only positive isolate was JmsCRE57, which belonged to the ST375 serotype K2 that expressed uge, mrkD, fimH, kpn, aerobactin and rmpA virulence-associated genes and showed strong biofilm formation and serum sensitivity. Sequencing results showed that the JmsCRE57 genome mainly consisted of a circular chromosome, three antimicrobial resistant plasmids and a virulent plasmid. The antimicrobial resistant plasmid expressing bla KPC-2 , bla CTX-M-15 , aph(3″)-Ib, aph(6)-Id, qnrB1, aac(3)-IIa, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, bla OXA-1 , bla TEM-1B , catB4, sul2, dfrA14 and bla SHV-99 . The virulent plasmid belonged to the IncHI1B group, which is mainly composed of mucoid phenotype genes and siderophore-associated genes. The remaining CRKP strains that expressed uge, fimH, mrkD and kpn virulenceassociated genes were not successfully typed. (Continued on next page) Conclusion: Our results provide new insights on the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant K2 hypervirulent K. pneumoniae ST375 and CRKP ST76 strains in northeast China, which may help control their future outbreaks.
12eb0d782c12c3ac096314c26bd9680609970bb9	One of the main problems in quantum information systems is the presence of errors due to noise. Many quantum error correcting codes have been designed to deal with generic errors. In this paper we construct new stabilizer codes able to correct a given number eg of generic Pauli X , Y and Z errors, plus a number eZ of Pauli errors of a specified type (e.g., Z errors). These codes can be of interest when the quantum channel is asymmetric, i.e., when some types of error occur more frequently than others. For example, we design a [[9, 1]] quantum error correcting code able to correct up to one generic qubit error plus one Z error in arbitrary positions. According to a generalized version of the quantum Hamming bound, it is the shortest code with this error correction capability.
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	In order to understand the spatio-temporal structure of epidemics beyond that permitted with classical SIR (susceptible-infectiverecovered)-type models, a new mathematical model for the spread of a viral disease in a population of spatially distributed hosts is described. The positions of the hosts are randomly generated in a rectangular habitat. Encounters between any pair of individuals are according to a Poisson process with a mean rate that declines exponentially as the distance between them increases. The contact rate allows the mean rates to be set at a certain number of encounters per day on average. The relevant state variables for each individual at any time are given by the solution of a pair of coupled differential equations for the viral load and the quantity of general immune system effectors which reduce the viral load. The parameters describing within-host viral-immune system dynamics are generated randomly to reflect variability across a population. Transmission is assumed to depend on the viral loads in donors and occurs with a probability p trans . The initial conditions are such that one randomly chosen individual carries a randomly chosen amount of the virus, whereas the rest of the population is uninfected. Simulations reveal local or whole-population responses. Whole-population disease spread may be in the form of isolated or multiple occurrences, the latter often being approximately periodic. The mechanisms of this oscillatory behaviour are analyzed in terms of several parameters and the distribution of critical points in the host dynamical systems. Increased contact rate, increased probability of transmission and decreased threshold for viral transmission, decreased immune strength and increased viral growth rate all increase the probability of multiple outbreaks and the distribution of the critical points also plays a role.
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	The swine-origin pandemic (p) H1N1 influenza A virus causes mild upper-respiratory tract disease in most human patients. However, some patients developed severe lower-respiratory tract infections with fatal consequences, and the cause of these infections remain unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that different populations have different degrees of susceptibility to pH1N1 strains due to host genetic variations that are associated with inappropriate immune responses against viral genetic characteristics. Here, we tested whether the pathologic patterns of influenza strains that produce different disease outcomes in humans could be reproduced in a ferret model. Our results revealed that the severities of infection did not correspond to particular viral isolate and were not associated with the clinical phenotypes of the corresponding patients. Severe pathological outcomes were associated with higher viral replication, especially in alveolar areas, and with an exacerbated innate cellular immune response that was characterised by substantial phagocytic and cytotoxic cell migration into the lungs. Moreover, detrimental innate cellular responses were linked to the up-regulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the down-regulation of IFNα in the lungs. Additionally, severe lung lesions were associated with greater up-regulations of pro-apoptotic markers and higher levels of apoptotic neutrophils and macrophages. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the clinicopathological outcomes of pH1N1 infection in ferrets were not only due to viral replication abilities but also depended on the hosts' capacities to mount efficient immune responses to control viral infection of the lung.
4cc161090a796945e7bda63489feb4f268bfeb3a	Background: The spike proteins of coronaviruses associate with cellular molecules to mediate infection of their target cells. The characterization of cellular proteins required for virus infection is essential for understanding viral life cycles and may provide cellular targets for antiviral therapies. Results: We identified Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) as a novel interacting partner of the PHE-CoV S protein. A T7 phage display cDNA library from N2a cells was constructed, and the library was screened with the soluble PHE-CoV S glycoproteins. We used a coimmunoprecipitation assay to show that only the NCAM was a binding partner of spike protein. We found that a soluble form of anti-NCAM antibody blocked association of the PHE-CoV with N2a cells. Furthermore, double-stranded siRNA targeted against NCAM inhibited PHE-CoV infection. Conclusions: A novel interaction was identified between NCAM and spike protein and this association is critical during PHE-CoV infection.
fc8351b07d36ee3eeac9f2d6e3021624dfe549a4	The risks from potential exposure to COVID-19, and resource reallocation that has occurred to combat the pandemic, have altered the balance of benefits and harms that informed current (pre-COVID-19) guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. We developed consensus statements to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (17), thoracic radiologists (5), and thoracic surgeons (2) was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A pre-defined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (5), evaluation of intermediate and high risk lung nodules (4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements by voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations where it was felt to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize non-urgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.

ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	Nuclear receptors (NRs) are closely associated with various major diseases such as cancer, diabetes, inflammatory disease, and osteoporosis. Therefore, NRs have become a frequent target for drug development. During the process of developing drugs against these diseases by targeting NRs, we are often facing a problem: Given a NR and chemical compound, can we identify whether they are really in interaction with each other in a cell? To address this problem, a predictor called "iNR-Drug" was developed. In the predictor, the drug compound concerned was formulated by a 256-D (dimensional) vector derived from its molecular fingerprint, and the NR by a 500-D vector formed by incorporating its sequential evolution information and physicochemical features into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition, and the prediction engine was operated by the SVM (support vector machine) algorithm. Compared with the existing prediction methods in this area, iNR-Drug not only can yield a higher success rate, but is also featured by a user-friendly web-server established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iNR-Drug/, which is particularly useful for most experimental scientists to obtain their desired data in a timely manner. It is anticipated that the iNR-Drug server may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the current approach may be easily extended to study the interactions of drug with other targets as well.

fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	Photonic biosensors that use optical resonances to amplify biological signals associated with the adsorption of low-index biological markers offer high-sensitivity detection capability, real-time readout, and scalable lowcost fabrication. However, they lack inherent target specificity and can be sensitive to temperature variations and other noise sources. In this letter, we introduce a concept of the High Contrast Probe Cleavage Detection (HCPCD) mechanism, which makes use of the dramatic optical signal amplification caused by cleavage of large numbers of high-contrast nanoparticle labels instead of the adsorption of low-index biological molecules. We illustrate numerically the HCPCD detection mechanism with an example of a silicon ring resonator as an optical transducer with gold and silicon nanoparticles as highcontrast labels. Simulations show that it is possible to detect a single cleavage-event by monitoring spectral shifts of micro-ring resonances. Furthermore, detection specificity and signal amplification can be achieved through the use of collateral nucleic acid cleavage caused by enzymes such as CAS12a and CAS13 after binding to a target DNA/RNA sequence.
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	Novel infectious diseases continue to emerge within human populations. Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-tohuman transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R 0 � 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections.
87dc0d35c4813a03c19333d1325088382f0dc536	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by leukocyte infiltration and subsequent axonal damage, demyelinating inflammation, and formation of sclerosing plaques in brain tissue. The results of various studies in patients indicate that autoimmunity and inflammation make an important impact on the pathogenesis of MS. Chemokines are key mediators of inflammation development and cell migration, mediating various immune cell responses, including chemotaxis and immune activation, and are important in immunity and inflammation, therefore we focus on chemokines and their receptors in multiple sclerosis. In this article, we summarize the study of the role of prominent chemokines and their receptors in MS patients and MS animal modelsand discuss their potential significance in inflammatory injury and repair of MS. We have also summarized the progress in the treatment of multiple sclerosis antagonists in recent years with chemokine receptors as targets.
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	we analysed the expression of clinically important pro-inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines. IAV infection or treatment with supernatants from IAV-infected cell cultures resulted in priming of the DCs which subsequently influenced the production of IL-12p70, as well as IL-6, following SP infection. Co-infection of the same cell was not required but this effect was dependent on the time, dose and duration of the infections, as well as pathogen viability, bacterial uptake and endosome acidification. Bacterially infected cells were characterized as the main producers of IL-12p70. Finally, we showed that type I interferons were primarily responsible for the priming of IL-12p70 that was observed by infection with IAV. These results provide a probable mechanism for the elevated levels of particular cytokines observed in IAV and SP co-infected cell cultures with implications for the pathogenic outcome observed during in vivo infection.

416fda9bb2411e60413dd167fb7ef3fd56faf07a	Filoviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. The archetypal virus of this group, Ebola virus, is responsible for the current filovirus epidemic in West Africa. Filoviruses infect most mammalian cells, resulting in broad species tropism and likely contributing to rapid spread of virus throughout the body. A thorough understanding of filovirus entry events will facilitate the development of therapeutics against these critical steps in the viral life cycle. This review summarizes the current understanding of filovirus entry and discusses some of the recent advancements in therapeutic strategies that target entry.
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	Background: Asymptomatic donors infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may pose a risk to the safety of the blood supply (1). Although a previous report described detection of viral RNA in donor plasma, these donors tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a respiratory specimen or developed fever shortly after donation, suggesting that the donation occurred early in the course of their infection (2). To our knowledge, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma from an eligible donor after recovery from illness has not yet been described. Objective: To report the case of a volunteer blood donor, healthy on the day of donation, who had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in their blood at least 40 days after resolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-like symptoms. Case Report: In mid-April 2020, we implemented a research SARS-CoV-2 real-time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test on our blood donations (Stanford Institutional Review Board protocol 55550) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope gene in plasma mini-pools of 6 donors (3). The RT-PCR has a 95% lower limit of detection of 123 copies/mL (95% CI, 100 to 146 copies/mL) by probit analysis. Positive pools were resolved by retesting the individual samples they comprised. This testing algorithm is in line with current U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved nucleic acid tests used to screen for infectious diseases in blood donors, which also use mini-pool testing. The index donation was collected on 23 April 2020 after approximately 700 negative donations. The cycle threshold value (Ct) for the positive mini-pool sample was 40.9, and the subsequent individual sample was positive at a Ct of 42.1-both results at the limit of detection for the assay. We further confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N2 region: Ct, 37.8) (4) from a separate sample drawn from the donor on the day of donation, thereby making cross-contamination highly unlikely. Negative plasma controls were included on each run, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected. Serologic testing for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain revealed the donor to have positivity at the assay cutoff for IgG (wavelength, 450 nm; optical density, 0.30; cutoff, 0.30), but negativity for IgM and IgA. Additional serologic testing (IgM, IgG, and IgA) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1 domain) and nucleocapsid proteins yielded negative results. Given these equivocal and negative findings, neutralization assays were not performed. The donor had symptoms of upper respiratory infection in early March, including body aches and sore throat without fever. The donor did not seek medical attention and was not tested for SARS-CoV-2 at that time. After the donor was notified about the results, and 5 days after the donation date, RT-PCR assay of the donor's nasopharyngeal swab specimen showed no SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Discussion: The confirmation of donor RNAemia more Stanford

It hinges on visual development of the interface and business logic but also on easy integration with data stores and services while delivering robust applications that scale. Data integration increasingly means accessing a variety of NoSQL stores. Unfortunately, the diversity of data and processing models, that make them useful in the first place, is difficult to reconcile with the simplification of abstractions exposed to developers in a low-code platform. Moreover, NoSQL data stores also rely on a variety of general purpose and custom scripting languages as their main interfaces. In this paper we report on building a polyglot data access layer for the OutSystems Platform that uses SQL with optional embedded script snippets to bridge the gap between low-code and full access to NoSQL stores.
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	SARS-coronavirus (CoV) is a zoonotic agent derived from rhinolophid bats, in which a plethora of SARS-related, conspecific viral lineages exist. Whereas the variability of virulence among reservoir-borne viruses is unknown, it is generally assumed that the emergence of epidemic viruses from animal reservoirs requires human adaptation. To understand the influence of a viral factor in relation to interspecies spillover, we studied the papain-like protease (PLP) of SARS-CoV. This key enzyme drives the early stages of infection as it cleaves the viral polyprotein, deubiquitinates viral and cellular proteins, and antagonizes the interferon (IFN) response. We identified a bat SARS-CoV PLP, which shared 86% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV PLP, and used reverse genetics to insert it into the SARS-CoV genome. The resulting virus replicated like SARS-CoV in Vero cells but was suppressed in IFN competent MA-104 (3.7-fold), Calu-3 (2.6-fold) and human airway epithelial cells (10.3fold). Using ectopically-expressed PLP variants as well as full SARS-CoV infectious clones chimerized for PLP, we found that a protease-independent, anti-IFN function exists in SARS-CoV, but not in a SARS-related, bat-borne virus. This PLP-mediated anti-IFN difference was seen in primate, human as well as bat cells, thus independent of the host context. The results of this study revealed that coronavirus PLP confers a variable virulence trait among members of the species SARS-CoV, and that a SARS-CoV lineage with virulent PLPs may have pre-existed in the reservoir before onset of the epidemic.
a22bc8b305be9ebfb75d2e71a23706796143dfa4	Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ABSTRACT: SARS CoV 2 is very much homologous in structure to SARS CoV. Review of literature suggests the in-vitro virucidal action of povidone iodine in SARS CoV and MERS. The oropharynx and nasopharynx are target sites of SARS CoV 2. A significant proportion of COVID 19 sufferers are asymptomatic, but shedding these viral particles, PVP-I has been shown to be a safe therapy when used as a mouthwash or taken nasally or used during ophthalmic surgeries. AIMS: 1. To propose the use of 0.5% Povidone iodine gargles and nasal drops as prerequisite for office based nose and throat examination and procedures during COVID 19 pandemic. 2. To assess tolerability of 0.5% PVP-I in patients and in healthcare workers MATERIALS AND METHODS: 0.5 % PVP-I solution is prepared from commercially available 10% PVP-I solution. Patients were instructed to put 0.5% PVP-I drops in nose and rinse mouth with gargle prior examinations for 30 seconds. For endoscopic procedure (nasal and throat) nasal douching and gargling to be started one day prior. Douching and rinsing to be repeated just before procedures. Nasal packing with 0.5% PVP-I along with 4 % xylocaine/adrenaline solution, tolerability and any allergic reaction noted. RESULTS: The patient and health care workers tolerated the 0.5%. No allergy was noted. CONCLUSION: We propose the use of 0.5% PVP-I in healthcare workers and their patients to minimise the risk of spread of the disease in addition to the recommended PPE.

0f9078b5444a0db303937feca748b4ba71bd797b	Mund-Nasenmasken, im Allgemeinen auch chirurgische Masken genannt, wurden in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts eingeführt, um die Ausatemluft von medizinischem Personal bei Operationen zu filtern und die postoperativen infektiösen Komplikationen zu verhindern. Die Effektivität dieser Masken wurde damals durch Umgebungsuntersuchungen mit Petrischalen getestet [1, 2] . Hiervon abzugrenzen sind FFP (filtering face piece, EN-Norm 149)-Masken der Klassen 1 -3, welche die Masken-tragende Person vor der Inhalation schädlicher Aerosole schützen sollen. Mund-Nasen-bzw. chirurgische Masken unterliegen der europäischen Norm EN 14683:2019 + AC:2019. In dieser Norm werden mehrere Anforderungen formuliert: 1. Mikrobiologische Reinheit (Prüfung auf bakterielle Belastung in der Verpackung) 2. Biokompatibilität (Eigenschaft der Verträglichkeit ohne negative oder unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen) 3. Bakterielle Filterleistung: Je nach Leistungsklasse muss ein bestimmter Prozentsatz von Bakterien eines Staphylokok-kenaerosols abgefiltert werden, welches mit einer bestimmten Flussrate über 49 cm 2 des aufgespannten Maskentuches geschickt wird (Filterleistung Klasse 1 ≥ 95 %, Klasse 2 ≥ 98 %) 4. Luftdurchlässigkeit des Maskentuches: Hier darf bei mittels Vakuumpumpe erzeugtem Fluss von 8 l/min über 4,9 cm 2 eines aufgespannten Maskentuches die Druckdifferenz -40 Pa/cm 2 nicht unterschreiten. Die Norm prüft somit im Kern die Dichtigkeit des reinen Maskentuchs auf Bakterien-Durchlässigkeit und stellt sicher, dass die Luftdurchlässigkeit des reinen Maskentuches ausreichend hoch ist, um die Atmung nicht zu sehr zu erschweren. Die Norm EN 14683:2019 + AC:2019 berücksichtigt nicht Leckagen, die zwischen dem Maskentuch und der Oberfläche der Gesichtshaut entstehen können. Ebenso wenig prüft die Norm einen möglichen Schutz der Masken-tragenden Person vor Gefahrstoffen aus der Umgebungsluft.
f31038fde5984b92a3b4bb4be0f763e9041ba557	Diarrhoea is a common and multi-factorial condition in dogs, the aetiology of which is often incompletely understood. A case-control study was carried out to compare the carriage of some common canine enteric pathogens (enteric coronavirus, parvovirus, distemper, endoparasites, Campylobacter and Salmonella spp.), as well as lifestyle factors such as vaccination history, diet and contact with other species, in dogs presenting at first opinion veterinary practices with and without diarrhoea. Multivariable conditional logistic regression showed that dogs in the study which scavenged or had had a recent change of diet (OR 3.5, p = 0.002), had recently stayed in kennels (OR 9.5, p = 0.01), or were fed a home-cooked diet (OR 4, p = 0.002) were at a significantly greater risk of diarrhoea, whilst being female (OR 0.4, p = 0.01), currently up to date with routine vaccinations (OR 0.4, p = 0.05) and having contact with horse faeces (OR 0.4, p = 0.06) were associated with a reduced risk. None of the pathogens tested for was a significant factor in the final multivariable model suggesting that in this predominantly vaccinated population, diarrhoea may be more associated with lifestyle risk factors than specific pathogens.
d955f71fe354a87e671999a6a0a17b88376bcf8c	Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis (EVA), a respiratory, systemic, and reproductive disease of horses and other equid species. Following natural infection, 10-70% of the infected stallions can become persistently infected and continue to shed EAV in their semen for periods ranging from several months to life. Recently, we reported that some stallions possess a subpopulation(s) of CD3 + T lymphocytes that are susceptible to in vitro EAV infection and that this phenotypic trait is associated with longterm carrier status following exposure to the virus. In contrast, stallions not possessing the CD3 + T lymphocyte susceptible phenotype are at less risk of becoming long-term virus carriers. A genome wide association study (GWAS) using the Illumina Equine SNP50 chip revealed that the ability of EAV to infect CD3 +

These 29 proteases proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and are key 30 modulators of virus tropism. We show that SARS-CoV-2 naïve serum exhibits significant 31 inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identify alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) as the major 32 serum protease inhibitor that potently restrict protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2. 33
655bf828f784fb0954d9fbe70fbcd0d204909438	We study the class of SIS epidemics on temporal networks and propose a new activity-driven and adaptive epidemic model that captures the impact of asymptomatic and infectious individuals in the network. In the proposed model, referred to as the A-SIYS epidemic, each node can be in three possible states: susceptible, infected without symptoms or asymptomatic and infected with symptoms or symptomatic. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals are infectious. We show that the proposed A-SIYS epidemic captures several well-established epidemic models as special cases and obtain sufficient conditions under which the disease gets eradicated by resorting to mean-field approximations. In addition, we highlight a potential inaccuracy in the derivation of the upper bound on the decay ratio in the activitydriven adaptive SIS (A-SIS) model in [1] and present a more general version of their result. We numerically illustrate the evolution of the fraction of infected nodes in the A-SIS epidemic model and show that the bound in [1] often fails to capture the behavior of the epidemic in contrast with our results.
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	Objective: Latent reactivation of HHV6 frequently occurs in patients (pts) undergoing HSCT. However, its clinical relevance is still a matter of discussion. Methods: We analysed all HHV6 positive results in pts undergoing HSCT within the BMT-unit from 1/94 to 4/00. Reactivation of HHV6 was defined either as significant increase in serum antibody titer (IgM positive, IgG Ͼ 1:64) or positive HHV-6 DNA (PCR). Since 1/98 HHV6 DNA from peripheral blood was weekly determined from date of the pts admission until discharge as part of a surveillance program. Results: HHV6 was reactivated in 140 pts (164 testing positive for HHV6-DNA, 10 for IgM and 14 for IgG). 132 pts received an allograft, 8 pts were autografted. The median age was 39,7 years. The diagnoses were chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (n=101), acute lymhocytic leukemia (n=12) and various hematopoietic disorders or solid tumors (n=27). Engraftment occured at a median of 19 days, HHV6 was detected 29 days posttransplantation (median) lasting a median of 6.5 days (range 1-743). Each patient showed a median of 2 samples positive (range 1-31). HHV6 was demonstrated in peripheral blood (61%), gastrointestinal biopsies (32%), bronchoalveolar lavage (16.4%), saliva/pharyngeal fluid (18,6%), bone marrow (4,3%), lung (7,6%), liver (6,4%) and miscellanous specimens (16,7%). Other viruses frequently observed in these pts were EBV (n= 85), CMV (n=42) and Adeno (n=45). The majority (78,6%) suffered graft versus host disease (GvHD). HHV6 was detected before onset of GVHD in only 25/110 pts (22,8%). With regard to HHV6 40% of all pts were asymptomatic. Clinical manifestations most frequently oberved included interstitial or alveolar pneumonia (23%), gastroduodenitis (16,5%), colitis (12,9%) and hepatopathia (7,2%). 93% of all pts were on aciclovir at time of HHV6 detection. Antiviral treatment was not successful in 27 of 41 evaluable pts under ganciclovir, 8/16 pts under foscarnet and 8/15 pts receiving cidofovir as determined by further detection of HHV6. Conclusions: Though the high rate of viral coinfections must be considered we report on unusual sites of detection and HHV6associated clinical manifestations. Antiviral therapy failed in a higher proportion of patients than expected. A study including HHV6 negative controls is ongoing. Introduction: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-induced posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) continues to be a major complication following stem cell transplantation and is associated with high mortality. The aim of the study was to evaluate EBV viral load as a parameter to identify patients at risk for developing PTLD. Methods: 68 samples of 9 patient with PTLD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) were analyzed by quantitative competitive PCR and compared with 349 samples from 50 patients (22 children, 28 adults) without PTLD after SCT. Results: All patients negative in EBV-DNA showed no sings of PTLD (266 samples). Patients with PTLD differed from patients without in EBV viral load. Median viral load at diagnosis of PTLD was 1 400 000 copies/microg DNA compared to 40 000 copies/microg DNA in 83 samples of patients without PTLD (p Ͻ0,0001). A cut off level of 100 000 EBV copies/microg DNA showed the best diagnostic efficacy with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 91%. PTLD occurred between day 40-170 after transplantation. Median time when EBV DNA was detectable prior to clinical onset of PTLD was 36 days (range 20-71 d). Patients developing PTLD did not differ from patients without PTLD in the time interval when the EBV viral load increased first after transplantation. EBV primary infections occurred earlier after transplantation than reactivations in patients without PTLD. Peak levels did not differ between primary infections and reactivations. Conclusion: EBV viral load is an important diagnostic tool in identifying patients at risk for PTLD. EBV reactivations or primary infections occur in a number of cases between 2 weeks and 3 month after transplantation but result only in few cases in PTLD. Influence of human herpesvirus 6 on the in vitro expansion of cord blood CD34+ cells J. Fleischmann, A. Nitsche, A. Radonic, W. Siegert (Berlin, D) Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), a member of the beta-herpesvirinae subfamily, is highly seroprevalent and has a world wide distribution. Two variant groups A and B are recognised. After primary infection HHV-6 persists lifelong in latency and can be reactivated in conditions of immunosuppression. It has been reported to be associated with myelosuppression after bone marrow transplantation. To elucidate the role of HHV-6 in hematopoiesis we investigated the influence of the two variants HHV-6A and B on in vitro expansion and differentiation of cord blood (CB) progenitor cells. MACS enriched CB-CD34+ cells were initially incubated with one of the HHV-6 variants and subsequently cultured for 14 days in the presence of cytokines supporting a maximal expansion of mononuclear cells. Infection was evaluated by immunofluorescence and real-time PCR. We found significant reduction of the expansion rate (pϽ.001) in cultures infected with HHV-6A compared to control cultures after 14 days. In contrast, HHV-6B did not exhibit a significant suppression. Inhibition affected all blood cell differentiation lines similarly as determined by flow cytometry for CD34, CD33, CD14, CXCR4 in HHV-6A, HHV-6B infected and in control cultures. Using quantitative PCR, we monitored the HHV-6 DNA load during cell culture. The correlation of cell expansion and the degree of infection (i.e. HHV-6 DNA load) revealed, that even high numbers of HHV-6B genome equivalents present in the culture had little suppressive effect on the total cell expansion. In contrast, HHV-6A had a strong suppressive effect. We were able to detect HHV-6 antigen in HHV-6A and B infected cultures but could not detect HHV-6 in immature CD34+ cells. When infection was

Although the polymerase chain reaction is the most commonly used, there are several other methods available, which have applicability across the range of microbial pathogens. This review does not intend to be a comprehensive treatise on the rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections. There are several excellent textbooks that cover the field in detail 1,2 . It will, instead, focus on recent and future trends. Laboratory diagnosis is essential in the overwhelming majority of clinical conditions that require specific therapy. It is a misconception, for example, that streptococcal pharyngitis can be reliably differentiated on clinical grounds from viral pharyngitis in an individual patient. Probability estimates can be made (for instance common cold symptoms have an 80% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis), but confirmation is only after laboratory examination. Most diagnostic advances in the last decade have focused on detection technologies. It should not be forgotten, however, that sampling inadequacies are the prime reason for failure to identify aetiology. It is well recognised that, for most respiratory viruses, the delay in transport of the specimen to the laboratory is usually the major factor in both slowness of the process and a failure to make a diagnosis. There has been some success in applying near-patient testing. This has, in general, made the diagnosis of respiratory tract virus infection more reliable and speedier. It has had particular use in differentiating respiratory syncytial virus cases who might need admission from other causes of viral respiratory tract infection. Another important consideration is the type of specimen used. For lower respiratory tract bacterial infections, sputum is the gold standard specimen, but the quality of the specimen is key because oral and gastrointestinal secretions may contaminate it. Ideally, there should be fewer than 10 squamous cells and greater than 25 leukocytes in a low power (x100
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	The coronavirus disease 2019 has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting 201 countries and territories around the globe. As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide. The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries. Motivated by the above discussion, we propose a novel hybrid ARIMA-WBF model which is a two-step pipeline approach. In the first step of the proposed hybrid approach, an ARIMA model is built to model the linear components of the epidemic time series, and a set of outof-sample forecasts are generated.

ed4edf512de93657bd637fb2c726577bfac617b9	The first reported case of COVID-19 in the State of Oregon occurred in late February 2020, with subsequent outbreaks occurring in the populous Portland metro area but also with significant outbreaks in less-populous and rural areas. Here we report viral sequences from 188 patients across the hospitals and associated clinics in the Providence Health System in the State of Oregon dating back to the early days of the outbreak. We show a significant shift in dominant clade lineages over time in Oregon, with the rapid emergence and dominance of Spike D614Gpositive variants. We also highlight significant diversity in SARS-CoV-2 sequences in Oregon, including a large number of rare mutations, indicative that these genomes could be utilized for outbreak tracing. Lastly, we show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic information may offer additional utility in combination with clinical covariates in the prediction of acute disease phenotypes.

Research from over the past 20 years has implicated dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) IV and its family members in many processes and different pathologies of the immune system. Most research has been focused on either DPPIV or just a few of its family members. It is, however, essential to consider the entire DPP family when discussing any one of its members. There is a substantial overlap between family members in their substrate specificity, inhibitors, and functions. In this review, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the role of prolyl-specific peptidases DPPIV, FAP, DPP8, DPP9, dipeptidyl peptidase II, prolyl carboxypeptidase, and prolyl oligopeptidase in the immune system and its diseases. We highlight possible therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, a condition that lies at the frontier between inflammation and cardiovascular disease.

7f796fc1f34c8e45bc773c7f0f7f982b750f7957	The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important issue for treatment and prevention of SARS. Recently, SARS-CoV 3CL pro protease has been implied to be possible relevance to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. In this study, we intended to identify potential 3CL pro -interacting cellular protein(s) using the phage-displayed human lung cDNA library. The vacuolar-H + ATPase (V-ATPase) G1 subunit that contained a 3CL pro cleavage site-like motif was identified as a 3CL pro -interacting protein, as confirmed using the co-immunoprecipitation assay and the relative affinity assay. In addition, our result also demonstrated the cleavage of the V-ATPase G1 fusion protein and the immunoprecipitation of cellular V-ATPase G1 by the 3CL pro . Moreover, loading cells with SNARF-1 pH-sensitive dye showed that the intracellular pH in 3CL pro -expressing cells was significantly lower as compared to mock cells.
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	Background: Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) are two important coronaviruses of domestic cat worldwide. Although FCoV is prevalent among cats; the fastidious nature of type I FCoV to grow on cell culture has limited further studies on tissue tropism and pathogenesis of FCoV. While several studies reported serological evidence for FCoV in Malaysia, neither the circulating FCoV isolated nor its biotypes determined. This study for the first time, describes the isolation and biotypes determination of type I and type II FCoV from naturally infected cats in Malaysia. Findings: Of the total number of cats sampled, 95% (40/42) were RT-PCR positive for FCoV. Inoculation of clinical samples into Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK), and Feline catus whole fetus-4 cells (Fcwf-4), show cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by syncytial cells formation and later cell detachment. Differentiation of FCoV biotypes using RT-PCR assay revealed that, 97.5% and 2.5% of local isolates were type I and type II FCoV, respectively. These isolates had high sequence homology and phylogenetic similarity with several FCoV isolates from Europe, South East Asia and USA. Conclusions: This study reported the successful isolation of local type I and type II FCoV evident with formation of cytopathic effects in two types of cell cultures namely the CrFK and Fcwf-4 , where the later cells being more permissive. However, the RT-PCR assay is more sensitive in detecting the antigen in suspected samples as compared to virus isolation in cell culture. The present study indicated that type I FCoV is more prevalent among cats in Malaysia.
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	The purpose of this study was to describe the temporal evolution of quantitative lung lesion features on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with common and severe types of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. Records of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were reviewed retrospectively from 24 January 2020 to 15 March 2020. Patients were classified into common and severe groups according to the diagnostic criteria of severe pneumonia. The quantitative CT features of lung lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, and the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), consolidation volume (PCV) and total lesion volume (PTV) were determined in both lungs. PGV, PCV and PTV were analyzed based on the time from the onset of initial symptoms in the common and severe groups. In the common group, PTV increased slowly and peaked at approximately 12 days from the onset of the initial symptoms. In the severe group, PTV peaked at approximately 17 days. The severe pneumonia group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV compared with the common group. These features started to appear in Stage 2 (4-7 days from onset of initial symptoms) and were observed in all subsequent stages (p<0.05). In severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, PGV, PCV and PTV began to significantly increase in Stage 2 and decrease in Stage 5 (22-30 days). Compared with common SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, the patients in the severe group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV as well as a later peak time of lesion and recovery time.

bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	The extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among pupils in primary schools and their families is unknown. Methods: Between 28-30 April 2020, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among pupils, their parents and relatives, and staff of primary schools exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 in a city north of Paris, France. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered sociodemographic information and history of recent symptoms. A blood sample was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a flow-cytometry-based assay. The infection attack rate (IAR) was 45/510 (8.8%), 3/42 (7.1%), 1/28 (3.6%), 76/641 (11.9%) and 14/119 (11.8%) among primary school pupils, teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, and relatives, respectively (P = 0.29). Prior to school closure on February 14, three SARS-CoV-2 infected pupils attended three separate schools with no secondary cases in the following 14 days among pupils, teachers and non-teaching staff of the same schools. Familial clustering of cases was documented by the high proportion of antibodies among parents and relatives of infected pupils (36/59 = 61.0% and 4/9 = 44.4%, respectively). In children, disease manifestations were mild, and 24/58 (41.4%) of infected children were asymptomatic. In young children, SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely mild or asymptomatic and there was no evidence of onwards transmission from children in the school setting.

Hoewel specifieke aspecten prominenter zijn in bepaalde sectoren van de zorg, staan alle zorgorganisaties voor de opgave om de randvoorwaarden te organiseren waarbinnen zorgprofessionals zo veel mogelijk mensen zo goed mogelijk kunnen helpen. Vanuit managementperspectief vallen vier grote thema's op in de manier waarop zorgorganisaties hiermee omgaan. Op de eerste plaats proberen zorgorganisaties met man en macht hun personeel inzetbaar te houden. Daarnaast worden er verschillende digitale oplossingen geïmplementeerd en wordt er op ongekende schaal en snelheid samengewerkt met organisaties binnen en buiten de zorg. Dit gebeurt in directe interactie met landelijk en regionaal beleid, dat als last of lust ervaren wordt. Om goed door de coronacrisis te komen en de zorg op een duurzame manier te organiseren in het 'nieuwe normaal' na de crisis, is het essentieel dat de lessen en best-practices van dergelijke initiatieven systematisch getrokken en verspreid worden.

Tietschert faculteit der Sociale Wetenschappen, vakgroep Organisatiewetenschappen, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Nederland Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents healthcare organizations with substantial challenges. Four main themes can be distinguished in the way healthcare organizations organize the necessary preconditions for their professionals to provide high quality care in this crisis. These include: keeping professionals employable, implementing a wide range of digital solutions, collaborating with organizations in and outside of healthcare at a large scale and rapid pace, and interacting with national and regional policy, which can either serve as a barrier or facilitator. It is essential to learn from these approaches and rapidly disseminate the associated best practices.
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	The purpose of this study is to explore whether the diffusion of cryptocurrencies represents a disruptive change and what is the potential magnitude of this change. To this end, we take disruptive innovation theory as our point of departure to scrutinize cryptocurrencies as an instance of sociotechnical change. We employ Causal Layered Analysis to develop our four-layer analytical framework to conceptually examine the changes pertained by the diffusion of cryptocurrencies. We provide examples of changes company-level, industry-level as well as societal changes where cryptocurrencies have played a central role. On a company level, cryptocurrencies provide a cost-efficient means for cross-border money transfer and thus pose a significant threat to the existing intermediary-based business models. On an industry level, many central banks are experimenting with crypto-or digital currencies. On a societal level, cryptocurrencies play an important role in particularly when the traditional institutions and societal structures collapse. For example, in Venezuela's recent political and economic crisis, cryptocurrencies contributed to the development of a parallel financial system when the bolivar practically lost its value. Our study provides an analytical framework to systematically evaluate the potential disruptive nature of cryptocurrencies as well as other blockchain-based technologies.
d418b60e11c54ca10f432bd4dffef23beb5bc8a6	Abstract: 270 • We conducted a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and identified 14 studies reporting on clinical or virologic outcomes and 6 additional studies reporting on the QT interval. • Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine improved virologic outcomes in 2 clinical studies and cough in another study. • Most studies either reported an increased risk of mortality (n = 2 studies) or need for respiratory support (n = 1 study) or no beneficial effects on pneumonia/intubation or death (n = 8 studies). • The proportion of participants with critical QTc  500 ms or an increase  60 ms ranged from 8.3% to 36% (n = 8 studies).
7967040b2131b69fec61d9f1d5c14dd214c49989	Globally, there are growing efforts to address diseases through the advancement in health research and development (R&D), strengthening of regional cooperation in science and technology (particularly on product discovery and development), and implementation of the World Health Assembly Resolution 61.21 (WHA61.21) on the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation, and Intellectual Property (GSPA-PHI). As such, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is responding to this through the establishment of the ASEAN-Network for Drugs, Diagnostics, Vaccines, and Traditional Medicines Innovation (ASEAN-NDI). This is important in the ASEAN considering that infectious tropical diseases remain prevalent, emerging, and reemerging in the region. This paper looks into the evolution of the ASEAN-NDI from its inception in 2009, to how it is at present, and its plans to mitigate public health problems regionally and even globally.

9aee0cad00998f83f85e815527be1a7ac00881ee	Isatis indigotica is widely used in Chinese Traditional Medicine for clinical treatment of virus infection, tumor, and inflammation, yet its antiviral activities remain unclear. This study probed antiviral activity of I. indigotica extract and its marker compounds against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). I. indigotica methanol extract, indigo, and indirubin proved less cytotoxic than other components, showing inhibitory effect (concentration-dependent) on JEV replication in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments proved the extract, indigo, and indirubin with potent antiviral effect by pretreatment (before infection) or simultaneous treatment (during infection), but not posttreatment (after entry). Antiviral action of these agents showed correlation with blocking virus attachment and exhibited potent virucidal activity. In particular, indirubin had strong protective ability in a mouse model with lethal JEV challenge. The study could yield anti-JEV agents.
26751b2ba4a8467e220c51ce3bcef915761d4fc5	Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is consisting of many practices that are common in East Asia. These practices have been around for more than 2000 years. Many of these methods are becoming increasingly popular in the Western world, where they are classified as alternative or complementary medicine. Most of these techniques are untested and some are even considered dangerous in the modern day world, however, they are sometimes able to help, where modern medicine can not. Therefore, it would be wrong to totally reject them. The SINOPOLL project is a joint R&D effort between Thor Medical Systems LLC and their Chinese partner Shenzhen Anke. Its goal is to combine the vast traditional knowledge in TCM with modern day medical system technology. This paper gives an overview of this research, as well, as proposes several possible solutions for common problems in this field.

14aaed701b65511f4581d0ff16a14ad15e8db3b8	The clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 are non-specific and multi-inflammatory. They vary from mild to severe manifestations that can be life-threatening. The association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pseudoaneurysm formation or rupture of an already existing aneurysm is still unexplored. Several mechanisms may be involved, including the direct destruction to the artery by the viral infection or through the release of the inflammatory cytokines. We are presenting a case of a 13-year-old girl with a ruptured cerebral pseudoaneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery (M2 segment) with severe intracerebral hemorrhage as the earliest manifestation of COVID-19 infection.
4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	Live-virus vaccines activate both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, require only a single boosting, and generally provide longer immune protection than killed or subunit vaccines. However, growth of live-virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects, and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serialtransfer viral adaptation are not well-understood. New methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth. To begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype, we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a well-studied, nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus. Our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of VSV while integrating key wild-type infection steps: hijacking of host resources, transcription, translation, and replication, followed by assembly and release of progeny VSV particles. Generalization of the wild-type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant VSV strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene. Finally, our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other VSV genes has the potential to attenuate the VSV growth while overexpressing the immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein. Such models will facilitate the engineering of new live-virus vaccines by linking genomic manipulations to controlled changes in virus gene-expression and growth.

236ed0c8180f5a7029d946638f03de48a5f88ac2	Human adenoviruses (hAdVs) are associated with acute respiratory tract infections in pediatric populations and have been identified as a cause of outbreaks in institutional settings. Rapid diagnosis of hAdV infection is critical for appropriate and timely management. This study reports the design and validation of a sensitive and specific multiplex real-time PCR for the detection of a broad range of hAdV serotypes in respiratory samples. The assay targets the conserved region of the hAdV hexon gene and utilizes hydrolysis probes for the detection of amplified products. The assay was evaluated using retrospectively (n ¼ 864) and prospectively (n ¼ 11,451) collected samples from November 2005 to July 2006. Seasonality studies and analysis of outbreaks was conducted over a 2-year period from January 2005 to December 2006 (n ¼ 33,067 samples). The assay gave a hAdV positive rate of 7.1% (n ¼ 811) for specimens tested prospectively and was able to detect a broad range of hAdV serotypes with good sensitivity and specificity. A high rate of co-infection was noted (21.7%). Adenovirus infections were more prevalent in the young with a median age of 24 months for positive patients. Sequence analysis of hAdV positives showed that serotype 7 was the most prevalent followed by serotypes 2 and 3. Association of hAdVs with respiratory outbreaks was low at 2.3% (6 of 266 outbreaks tested) and no seasonal variation was observed for hAdV infections during the 2-year study period. This assay can improve the detection of hAdVs in respiratory samples and can be used to provide valuable epidemiological information.
6940b4b67074be32004ffdc1b82dfb8b4699a0de	Acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) are known to worsen asthma particularly in children. There are few studies in adults assessing the incidence of RTI in patients hospitalized with acute asthma. Aim: To document the incidence of RTI in adults hospitalized with acute asthma. Methods: A prospective study of patients with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Western Hospital Footscray, over a 12-month period. A control group was studied from elective surgical inpatients. Patients were investigated with serologic tests for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and influenza A and B. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were cultured for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and herpes simplex virus. If sputum was available, it was assessed with microscopy and culture. Blood cultures were taken if patients were febrile and all patients had a chest radiograph. Control subjects completed serologic tests and NP A. Results: Seventy-nine patients (33 male and 46 female) and 54 control subjects (26 male and 28 female) were studied. Two patients were enrolled twice. Mean (±SD) age of patients was 35±15 years (range, 16 to 66 years), and mean age of control subjects was 37±15 years (range, 18 to 69 years). In the patient group, 29 (37%) had evidence of recent RTI of which 23 were viral. Five of the control subjects (9%) had evidence of recent RTI (p<0.001). Twenty-four patients were positive on serologic and/or NP A culture. Five patients had positive serologic test results and/or NP A culture to two or more agents. Two patients tested positive on sputum, radiograph, and temperature criteria. Three patients tested positive on the basis of radiographic evidence of consolidation, blood neutrophilia, and temperature. Influenza A (13) and rhinovirus (9) were the most common infectious agents. Other agents identified were RSV (one), influenza B (two), adenovirus (one), and Mycoplasma (one). Influenza and rhinovirus infections occurred predominantly in late and early winter, respectively. Summer hospitalization did not relate to RTI. Conclusion: Thirty-seven percent of adult patients with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine over a 12-month period had evidence of recent RTI. (CHEST 1997; 112:591-96) 
1c8afcb822dac8e8e5b33a85c2c2e9c7cc24a25a	Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes highly contagious respiratory or urogenital tract diseases in chickens. The Maryland 27(Md27) strain was first isolated in 1976 from diseased chicken flocks in the Delmarva Peninsula region. To understand the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship of existing strains with Md27, the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3'end coding region (~7.2 kb) of Md27 was determined and compared with other IBV strains and coronaviruses. It has the same S-3-M-5-N-3' gene order, as is the case of other IBV strains. The spike gene of Md27 exhibits 97% identity with the SE17 strain. There are deletions at the spike gene, non-coding region between M and 5 genes, and at the 3'untranslated region (UTR), which is different from Ark-like strains. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments demonstrate that Md27 is a chimera containing different gene segments that are most closely related to the SE17, Conn and JMK strains. This current study provides evidence for genomic mutations and intergenic recombination that have taken place in the evolution of IBV strain Md27.
107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198	Increasing the yield and the productivity in cell culture-based vaccine manufacturing using high-cell-density (HCD) cultivations faces a number of challenges. For example, medium consumption should be low to obtain a very high concentration of viable host cells in an economical way but must be balanced against the requirement that accumulation of toxic metabolites and limitation of nutrients have to be avoided. HCD cultivations should also be optimized to avoid unwanted induction of apoptosis or autophagy during the early phase of virus infection. To realize the full potential of HCD cultivations, a rational analysis of the cultivation conditions of the appropriate host cell line together with the optimal infection conditions for the chosen viral vaccine strain needs to be performed for each particular manufacturing process. We here illustrate our strategy for production of the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus isolate MVA-CR19 in the avian suspension cell line AGE1.CR.pIX at HCD. As a first step we demonstrate that the adjustment of the perfusion rate strictly based on the measured cell concentration and the glucose consumption rate of cells enables optimal growth in a 0.8 L bioreactor equipped with an ATF2 system. Concentrations up to 57 Â 10 6 cells/mL (before infection) were obtained with a viability exceeding 95%, and a maximum specific cell growth rate of 0.019 h À1 (doubling time = 36.5 h). However, not only the cell-specific MVA-CR19 virus yield but also the volumetric productivity was reduced compared to infections at conventional-cell-density (CCD). To facilitate optimization of the virus propagation phase at HCD, a larger set of feeding strategies was analyzed in small-scale cultivations using shake flasks. Densities up to 63 Â 10 6 cells/mL were obtained at the end of the cell growth phase applying a discontinuous perfusion mode (semi-perfusion) with the same cell-specific perfusion rate as in the bioreactor (0.060 nL/(cell d)). At this cell concentration, a medium exchange at time of infection was required to obtain expected virus yields during the first 24 h after infection. Applying an additional fed-batch feeding strategy during the whole virus replication phase resulted in a faster virus titer increase during the first 36 h after infection. In contrast, a semicontinuous virus harvest scheme improved virus accumulation and recovery at a rather later stage of infection. Overall, a combination of both fed-batch and medium exchange strategies resulted in similar cell-specific virus yields as those obtained for CCD processes but 10-fold higher MVA-CR19 titers, and four times higher volumetric productivity.
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	The cytokine family of interferons (IFNs) has multiple functions, including antiviral, antitumor, and immunomodulatory effects and regulation of cell differentiation. The multiple functions of the IFN system are thought to be an innate defense against microbes and foreign substances. The IFN system consists first of cells that produce IFNs in response to viral infection or other foreign stimuli and second of cells that establish the antiviral state in response to IFNs. This process of innate immunity involves multiple signaling mechanisms and activation of various host genes. Viruses have evolved to develop mechanisms that circumvent this system. IFNs have also been used clinically in the treatment of viral diseases. Improved treatments will be possible with better understanding of the IFN system and its interactions with viral factors. In addition, IFNs have direct and indirect effects on tumor cell proliferation, effector leukocytes and on apoptosis and have been used in the treatment of some cancers. Improved knowledge of how IFNs affect tumors and the mechanisms that lead to a lack of response to IFNs would help the development of better IFN treatments for malignancies.
1142bd436ce67b7a76a4edb1a555fee6b179b546	Dengue virus (DENV) represents a public health threat and economic burden in affected countries. The availability of genomic data is key to understanding viral evolution and dynamics, supporting improved control strategies. Currently, the use of highthroughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, which can be applied both directly to patient samples (shotgun metagenomics) and to PCR-amplified viral sequences (amplicon sequencing), is potentially the most informative approach to monitor viral dissemination and genetic diversity by providing, in a single methodological step, identification and characterization of the whole viral genome at the nucleotide level. Despite many advantages, these technologies require bioinformatics expertise and appropriate infrastructure for the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data. In addition, the many software solutions available can hamper the reproducibility and comparison of results. Here we present DEN-IM, a one-stop, user-friendly, containerized and reproducible workflow for the analysis of DENV short-read sequencing data from both amplicon and shotgun metagenomics approaches. It is able to infer the DENV coding sequence (CDS), identify the serotype and genotype, and generate a phylogenetic tree. It can easily be run on any UNIX-like system, from local machines to high-performance computing clusters, performing a comprehensive analysis without the requirement for extensive bioinformatics expertise. Using DEN-IM, we successfully analysed two types of DENV datasets. The first comprised 25 shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples from patients with variable serotypes and genotypes, including an in vitro spiked sample containing the four known serotypes. The second consisted of 106 paired-end and 76 single-end amplicon sequences of DENV 3 genotype III and DENV 1 genotype I, respectively, where DEN-IM allowed detection of the intra-genotype diversity. The DEN-IM workflow, parameters and execution configuration files, and documentation are freely available at https:// github. com/ B-UMMI/ DEN-IM).
b116a14188bc1149cba0382e246ceb7df66cdedc	Background: Recently BRAF V600E mutations have emerged as genetic hallmark of hairy cell leukemia (HCL). This specific point mutation is present in virtually all cases of HCL but exceedingly rare in other peripheral B-cell neoplasms. Aim of the study: In this study we investigated the application of a BRAF V600E mutation specific antibody (clone VE1) to differentiate HCL from HCL mimics, such as HCLvariant and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Materials and methods: A total of 52 routinely processed formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens were investigated (bone marrow n046; spleen n06) for expression of V600E mutated BRAF protein. Results: All 32 cases of HCL were scored positive, all non HCL cases were scored negative. In 28 of 30 HCL cases the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation could be confirmed by direct sequencing while no BRAF mutations were detected among 20 HCL-mimics. We further screened 228 mature Bcell neoplasms with VE1 and detected one positive case of B-lymphocytic leukemia. Sequencing confirmed the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation. Conclusions: In conclusion we demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of VE1 immunohistochemistry for HCL. This on-slide technique might be particularly helpful in interpreting challenging biopsies with low tumor content.

de947b0c485c07c6e12c5feb4efd1ac6b1ac54f3	Family meetings are fundamental to the practice of palliative medicine and serve as a cornerstone of intervention on the inpatient palliative care consultation service. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the structure and process of in-patient family meetings, due to necessary but restrictive visitor policies that did not allow families to be present in the hospital. We describe implementation of telemedicine to facilitate electronic family (e-family) meetings to facilitate in-patient palliative care. Of 67 scheduled meetings and performed by the palliative care service, only 2 meetings were aborted for a 97% success rate of scheduled meetings occurring. On a five-point Likert-type scale, the average clinician rating of the e-family meeting overall quality was 3.18 (SD, 0.96). Of the 10 unique family participants that agreed to be interviewed, their overall ratings of the e-family meetings were high. Over 80% of respondent families participants reported that they agreed or strongly agreed that they were able to ask all of their questions, felt comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings with the clinical team, felt like they understood the care their loved one received, and that the virtual family meeting helped them trust the clinical team. Of patients who were able to communicate 50% of family respondents reported that the e-family meeting helped them understand their loved one's thoughts and wishes.
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	This study investigated abomasal luminal parameters in healthy and diarrheic calves by using a wireless ambulatory capsule (WAC). The acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was used to determine abomasal emptying rate. Four healthy and five diarrheic female Holstein-Friesian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study. For APAT, calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen/kg body weight, and blood samples were taken during a 12-h period afterward. Concomitantly, a WAC in the abomasum continuously measured luminal pH, pressure, and temperature. Five hours post suckling, intraluminal temperature was significantly higher in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves. Abomasal pH and pressure were not significantly different, but intraluminal pressure was always numerically lower in diarrheic calves. During APAT no significant differences in maximum acetaminophen concentrations (C max ) and time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (T max ) were observed. Nonlinear regression findings revealed a longer acetaminophen half-time (AAP t 1/2 ) in diarrheic calves compared to healthy calves [564 ± 96 min vs. 393 ± 84 min, respectively; P = 0.04] and lower area under the concentration curve values (e.g., 60 min postprandial AUC 60 681 ± 244 (µg•min)/mL vs. 1064 ± 23 (µg•min)/mL, respectively; P = 0.04). In conclusion, abomasal luminal conditions were different between diarrheic and healthy calves. Significant differences in APAT reflected a delay in abomasal emptying in diarrheic calves. Impaired abomasal movement may induce enhanced bacterial fermentation processes as indicated by a higher abomasal temperature in diarrheic calves, which should be considered in management of their feeding.
53418502dd5cdd7ae9e551ecd15398af5613b5b6	Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes AIDS in the domestic cat (Felis catus) but has not been explicitly associated with AIDS pathology in any of the eight free-ranging species of Felidae that are endemic with circulating FIV strains. African lion (Panthera leo) populations are infected with lion-specific FIV strains (FIVple), yet there remains uncertainty about the degree to which FIV infection impacts their health. Reported CD4+ T-lymphocyte depletion in FIVple infected lions and anecdotal reports of lion morbidity associated with FIV sero-prevalence emphasize the concern as to whether FIVple is innocuous or pathogenic. Here we monitored clinical, biochemical, histological and serological parameters among FIVple-positive (N=47) as compared to FIVple negative (N=17) lions anesthetized and sampled on multiple occasions between 1999 and 2006 in Botswana. Relative to uninfected lions, FIVple infected lions displayed a significant elevation in the prevalence of AIDS defining conditions: lymphandenopathy, gingivitis, tongue papillomas, dehydration, and poor coat condition, as well as displaying abnormal red blood cell parameters and elevated liver enzymes and serum proteins. Spleen and lymph node laparoscopic biopsies from free-ranging FIVple infected lions (N=8) revealed evidence of lymphoid depletion, the hallmark pathology documented in immunodefieciency virus infections of humans (HIV-1), macaques, and domestic cats. We conclude
6970df5eee622e854847bddc7fbb313c098b9f37	Avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) is a major poultry pathogen. A characteristic feature of IBV is the occurrence of many different strains belonging to different serotypes, which renders complete control of the disease by vaccination a challenging task due to the poor cross-protection between different serotypes. In this study, based on the results of S1 sequence analysis and virus crossneutralization tests, IBV strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 was found to be genetically and antigenically different from other known IBV types, representing not only a novel genotype, but also a novel serotype (designated as GI-28). Viruses belonging to this novel serotype have been isolated from several regions in China in recent years, suggesting endemic circulation of the serotype in various geographic locations in China. Further studies by complete genomic analysis showed that strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 may have originated from recombination events involving LX4 genotype IBVs and an as-yet-unidentified IBV donating a S1 gene, or from the result of accumulation of mutations and selections, especially in the S1 gene, from a LX4 genotype virus. ck/CH/LGX/111119 is a nephropathogenic strain, although it had broader tissue tropism (respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts) among chickens challenged at one day old. Infection of the oviducts with ck/CH/LGX/111119 found in this study may have severe implications because the virus will likely induce the occurrence of false layers.
1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	COVID-19 pandemic has spread all over the world for months. As its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, the accurate and fast detection of the COVID-19 infection is crucial. Although many recent studies have shown that deep learning based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans, there lacks a consistent and systematic comparison and evaluation on these techniques. In this paper, we first build a clean and segmented CT dataset called Clean-CC-CCII by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large CT scan dataset CC-CCII with three classes: novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls (Normal). After cleaning, our dataset consists of a total of 340,190 slices of 3,993 scans from 2,698 patients. Then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. With extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning, we find that the 3D CNN model DenseNet3D121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63% (F1score is 88.14% and AUC is 0.940), and another 3D CNN model ResNet3D34 achieves the best AUC of 0.959 (accuracy is 87.83% and F1-score is 86.04%). We further demonstrate that the mixup data augmentation technique can largely improve the model performance. At last, we design an automated deep learning methodology to generate a lightweight deep learning model MNas3DNet41 that achieves an accuracy of 87.14%, F1-score of 87.25%, and AUC of 0.957, which are on par with the best models made by AI experts. The automated deep learning design is a promising methodology that can help health-care professionals develop effective deep learning models using their private data sets. Our Clean-CC-CCII dataset and source code are available at:https://github.com/arthursdays/HKBU HPML COVID-19.
af85d62dad56c342735a9de492e94b1764a4fbcb	Background: Patient selection and cannulation arguably represent the key steps for the successful implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Cannulation is traditionally performed in the operating room or the catheterization laboratory for a number of reasons, including physician preference and access to real-time imaging, with the goal of minimizing complications and ensuring appropriate cannula positioning. Nonetheless, the patients' critical and unstable conditions often require emergent initiation of ECMO and preclude the safe transport of the patient to a procedural suite. Aims: Therefore, with the objective of avoiding delay with the initiation of therapy and reducing the hazard of transport, we implemented a protocol for bedside ECMO cannulation. County Medical Center between March 2015 and December 2019. Twenty-eight (31%) required veno-venous support and were all cannulated at the bedside. Overall survival was 71% with no morbidity or mortality related to the cannulation procedure. Conclusion: In the current pandemic, the strategy of veno-venous bedside cannulation may have additional benefits for the care of patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease-2019, decreasing the risk of exposure of health care worker or other patients to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 occurring during patient transport, preparation, or during disinfection of the procedural suite and the transportation pathway after ECMO cannulation.
89e5e252b3311d452f628ba23f5bc2f65f275af5	The efficient time schedule and prioritization of vaccine supplies are important in mitigating impact of an influenza pandemic. In practice, there are restrictions associated with limited vaccination coverage and the maximum daily vaccine administration. We extend previous work on optimal control for influenza to reflect these realistic restrictions using mixed constraints on state and control variables. An optimal control problem is formulated with the aim of minimizing the number of infected individuals while considering intervention costs. Time-dependent vaccination is computed and analysed using a model incorporating heterogeneity in population structure under different settings of transmissibility levels, vaccine coverages, and time delays.
4bef38bc6445329c2ebb4beb95b4f79c03d90edd	The effect of corona discharge-generated air ions on the filtration of aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 was studied. A carbon-fiber ionizer was installed upstream of a medium-efficiency air filter to generate air ions, which were used to charge the virus aerosols and increase their filtration efficiency. After the virus aerosols were captured by the filter for a certain time interval, they were exposed to a newly incoming air ion flow. Captured virus particles were detached from the filter by sonication, and their antiviral efficiency due to air ions was calculated by counting the plaque-forming units. The antiviral efficiency increased with ion exposure time and ion concentration. When the concentration of positive air ions was 10 7 ions/cm 3 , the antiviral efficiencies were 46.1, 78.8, and 83.7% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. When the ionizer was operated in a bipolar mode, the number concentrations of positive and negative ions were 6.6×10 6 and 3.4×10 6 ions/cm 3 , respectively, and the antiviral efficiencies were 64.3, 89.1, and 97.4% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. As a quantitative parameter for the performance evaluation of air ions, the susceptibility constant of bacteriophage MS2 to positive, negative, bipolar air ions was calculated as 5.5×10 −3 , 5.4×10 −3 and 9.5×10 −3 , respectively. These susceptibility constants showed bipolar ion treatment was more effective about 1.7 times than unipolar ion treatment.
ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	Given the higher mortality rate and widespread phenomenon of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) within the United States (US) population, understanding the mutational pattern of SARS CoV-2 has global implications for detection and therapy to prevent further escalation. Los Angeles has become an epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the US. Efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 require identifying its genetic and geographic variation and understanding the drivers of these differences. For the first time, we report genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates in the Los Angeles population using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). Samples collected at Cedars Sinai Medical Center were collected from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified and diagnosed 192 patients by our in-house qPCR assay. In this population, the highest frequency variants were in known mutations in the 5'UTR, AA193 protein, RdRp and the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the local community was tracked by integrating mutation data with patient postal codes with two predominant community spread clusters being identified. Notably, significant viral genomic diversity was identified. Less than 10% of the Los Angeles community samples resembled published mutational profiles of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, while >50% of the isolates shared closely similarities to those from New York State. Based on these findings we conclude SARS-CoV-2 was likely introduced into the Los Angeles community predominantly from New York State but also via multiple other independent transmission routes including but not limited to Washington State and China.
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 2 Abstract We evaluated farmworkers exposed to pesticides and individuals with no history of occupational exposure to pesticides. It was performed the comet assay to evaluate DNA damage. The immunophenotyping of TCD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood was performed by flow cytometry. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PON1, XRCC1, IL6, IL6R, TNF-α, and MIR137 genes were evaluated by real-time PCR. The exposed group was composed mostly by males (69.44%), with direct exposure to pesticides (56%) and with an average age range of 46 ± 13.89 years, being that 58.3% of farmworkers directly exposed to pesticides and reported the full use of personal protective equipment (PPE). DNA damage was greater in the exposed group (p < 0.05), reinforced by the use of PPE to denote a lower degree of DNA damage (p = 0.002). In this context, in the exposed group, we demonstrated that the use of PPE, age, gender and intoxication events were the variables that most contributed to increase DNA damage (p < 0.0001). Besides, the exposed group showed a significant increase in the subpopulations of T lymphocytes CD3 + CD4 + (p = 0.04) and CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + (p < 0.0001). SNPs in the TNF-α (rs361525) gene presented a difference in the genotype distribution between the groups (p = 0.002). The genotype distribution of TNF-α (rs361525) was also positively correlated with the DNA damage of the exposed group (r = 0.19; p = 0.01), demonstrating a higher risk of DNA damage in the farmworkers presenting the A mutated allele. Our findings demonstrate that pesticides can exert various deleterious effects on human health by damaging the DNA as well as by influencing the immune system in the case of both direct or indirect exposure and these issues are associated to age, gender, intoxication and the nonuse of PPE.
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	Bovine torovirus (BToV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is an established gastrointestinal infectious agent in cattle. No epidemiological research on BToV has been reported from Japan. In this study, we performed a survey to detect BToV in Japan in 2004 and 2005 using 231 fecal samples (167 from diarrheic cattle and 64 from asymptomatic cattle) that were analyzed by nested reverse transcription (RT) PCR using primers located in the consensus sequences of the reported BToV nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes. BToV N, M, and S genes were detected in 6.5% (15/231), 6.1% (14/231), and 5.6% (13/231) of samples by nested-RT-PCR, respectively. In conclusion, detectability was improved compared to the results of the first round of RT-PCR. BToV was detected at a significantly higher rate in diarrheic samples than in asymptomatic samples (14/167 diarrheic samples [8.4%] and 1/64 asymptomatic samples [1.6%]), suggesting that BToV may act as a risk factor for diarrhea in Japanese cattle. The nucleotide sequence of M fragments from the BToV isolates including the newly identified Japanese isolates showed more than 97% identity. A similar degree of homology was observed in the N gene fragment among BToV isolates with the exception of BRV-1 and BRV-2. Domestic samples were classified into three clusters by phylogenetic analysis of the S gene fragment, which were considerably correlated with the geographic origin of the samples. BToV positive areas did not adjoin each other but were spread across a wide range, suggesting that BToV exists conventionally in Japan and is geographically differentiated. We also developed an RFLP method to distinguish these clusters using two restriction enzymes, HaeIII and AccI. This method should be useful for comparing newly acquired BToV-positive samples with the reported BToVs.

The integral transforms are defined using so-called qualitative residuum based fuzzy integrals and integral kernels in the form of binary fuzzy relations. We present some of the basic properties of proposed integral transforms including a linearity property that is satisfied under specific conditions for comonotonic functions.
871ebc4ba030dbc666e9520d28b5f64e7a0ebf17	Pathogens of bacterial and viral origin hijack pathways operating in eukaryotic cells in many ways in order to gain access into the host, to establish themselves and to eventually produce their progeny. The detailed molecular characterization of the subversion mechanisms devised by pathogens to infect host cells is crucial to generate targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we review recent data indicating that coronaviruses probably co-opt membranous carriers derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, which contain proteins that regulate disposal of misfolded polypeptides, for their replication. In addition, we also present models describing potential mechanisms that coronaviruses could employ for this hijacking.
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. Findings From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by nextgeneration sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Interpretation Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	The SOLIDARITY and DisCoVeRy trials were launched to facilitate the rapid worldwide comparison of the efficacy and safety of treatments against COVID-19. This study aimed to review the trial designs of SOLIDARITY and DisCoVeRy and their feasibility to generate high-quality evidence. The DisCoVeRy trial design was detailed consistently in both the European and the US clinical rial registries. SOLIDARITY was registered on ICTRP, with country-specific information reported on country-level registry platforms. The DisCoVeRy trial's design appears to be ideal from the methodological perspective. Both trials appear difficult to implement, impractical, and disconnected from the pandemic reality. This is consistent with the apparent failure of the trials to deliver conclusions before the end of the pandemic. Both trials constitute an interesting initiative yet may lack the resources to support a highquality implementation. The authors call for a pandemic task force, with various experts on the front-line of COVID-19, to inform policy-makers to make effective decisions that may not be based on traditional, methodological state-of-the-art evidence, but rather pragmatic and revisable decisions reflecting emerging evidence for the benefit of patients and society.
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	Keywords The emergence and consequent impact of COVID-19 has led to clinicians and academics looking for evidence, with clinical controversies to parallel socio-economical and political ones. A key clinical controversy has been whether the use of angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might be detrimental or beneficial in COVID-19. This is a widely prescribed class of drugs with a strong evidence base in hypertension and cardiovascular risk reduction. Individuals have proposed stopping such drugs due to concern over up-regulation of the ACE2 receptor acting as the SARS-CoV-2 entry point; others paradoxically suggest prescribing this class of drugs to counteract a dysregulated angiotensinaldosterone system. We therefore explore the links between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the ACE2 receptor specifically; expanding on the observation that hypertension is prevalent among those diagnosed with COVID-19. SARS-Cov2 virus: the pathogen responsible for COVID-19. The SARS-Cov2 virus achieves cell entry through an S (spike) high-affinity protein binding to the catalytic domain of the ACE2 receptor; 1 pneumocytes are particularly vulnerable. ACE2: the RAAS is well characterized in hypertension, heart failure, and beyond. ACE converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to Ang II, predominantly in the lungs. The effects of Ang II are dependent on receptor binding: AT1 receptor binding stimulates the classical effects of Ang II, ranging from increased oxidative stress, through to vasoconstriction; in principle, AT2 receptor regulates opposing effects. ACE2 is an enzyme attached to cell membranes in the lungs, endothelium, and heart, as well as the kidneys. Its main pharmacological effect is to lower blood pressure by catalysing the cleavage of Ang I to Ang 1-9 and of Ang II to Ang 1-7 (vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory activity). ACE2 has additional affinity for other vasoactive substrates, including apelin-13 and bradykinin. Soluble ACE2 has also been described, cleaved from the cell surface but with a preserved catalytic activity. A sex difference exists, with men displaying higher ACE2 levels. 2,3 Circulating levels are low in good health, but rise in heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and kidney disease: • In 79 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (59% on an ACE inhibitor/ARB), the 10-year MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events) rate was higher in those with higher plasma ACE2 activity at baseline (P = 0.035); ACE2 remained an independent predictor in multivariable analysis [hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.7]. 2 • Hospitalization due to heart failure in the same cohort was associated with higher ACE2 with a HR of 1.0 (95% CI 1.4-11.5, P = 0.009). 2 • Post-operative ACE2 levels following orthopaedic surgery in 187 patients were significantly greater in patients with a subsequent inhospital cardiac event (25.3 vs. 39.5 pmol/mL/min, P = 0.012), though this did not remain significant in multivariate analysis. 4 • In 103 participants, increased ACE2 activity was associated with hypertension, impaired left ventricular systolic function, and older age; atrial fibrillation (P = 0.04) and vascular disease (P < 0.01) were independent predictors of plasma ACE2 activity. 3 ACE inhibitor/ARB use was reported in 28% of controls, 36% of paroxysmal AF, and 55% of persistent AF participants. Differing rates of ACE inhibitor/ARB use between groups is important considering the aforementioned effect on membrane-bound ACE2, and a largely unknown effect on soluble ACE2. Is ACE2 up-regulated by ACE inhibitor/ARB use, and does this facilitate COVID-19 cell entry and increase severity of infection?: The concept of the up-regulation of ACE2 arises from animal studies; with rats demonstrating reduced plasma Ang II, increased ACE2 mRNA, and higher plasma Ang 1-7 in response to lisinopril or enalapril, and the latter two effects also found with losartan. 5 However, conflicting evidence can also be found, with ramipril failing to increase ACE2 despite a similar duration of ACE inhibition. 6 Mechanistically, Ang II induces lysosomal internalization of ACE2, and thus reduces tissue expression; losartan prevents this through interaction and stabilization of ACE2 with AT1 receptors. 7 This leads to the converse argument, that ARBs could reduce SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by reducing availability of binding sites and reducing internalization of ACE2. However, a virus only needs one receptor to infect a cell, and the effect of ARB on Ang II breakdown to Ang 1-7 was not studied. There has not been any good evidence of ACE2 up-regulation associated with these drugs in humans 2,3 and, despite 61% sequence similarity between ACE1 and ACE2, ACE inhibitors do not effect ACE2 receptors. It is notable that animal work is predominantly based on tissue expression, and human work on soluble/circulating ACE2, when the relationship between these remains unclear. Furthermore, mice and rats are not
9306cdc04e064ce1f94afebefa524724bd5e1cfc	Protein microarray is considered to be one of the key analytical tools for high-throughput protein function analysis. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis HY5 functions as a novel DNA-binding tag (DBtag) for proteins. We also demonstrate that the DBtagged proteins could be immobilized and purified on a newly designed agarose/DNA microplate. Furthermore, we show three applications using the microarray: (1) detection of autophosphorylation activity of DBtagged human protein kinases and inhibition of their activity by staurosporine, (2) specific cleavage of DBtagged proteins by a virus protease and caspase 3, and (3) detection of a protein-protein interaction between the DBtagged UBE2N and UBE2v1. Thus, this method may facilitate rapid functional analysis of a wide range of proteins.
7ac7477b51d14d0b265043e777392dce8d83efb7	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3a protein is one of the opening reading frames in the viral genome with no homologue in other known coronaviruses. Expression of the 3a protein has been demonstrated during both in vitro and in vivo infection. Here we present biochemical data to show that 3a is a novel coronavirus structural protein. 3a was detected in virions purified from SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells although two truncated products were present predominantly instead of the full-length protein. In Vero E6 cells transiently transfected with a cDNA construct for expressing 3a, a similar cleavage was observed. Furthermore, co-expression of 3a, membrane and envelope proteins using the baculovirus system showed that both full-length and truncated 3a can be assembled into virus-like particles. This is the first report that demonstrated the incorporation of 3a into virion and showed that the SARS-CoV encodes a novel coronavirus structural protein.
a1679a198e5d4e1edede496ce4e3881e0c37904a	The aim of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of coccidian infections in suckling piglets and sows in Poland. The research was carried out in 14 out of 16 Polish provinces in the years 2003-2005. The investigation was conducted on three types of farms: large farms (>100 sows), medium farms (25-100 sows) and small farms (<25 sows). Diarrhoea of unweaned piglets was observed on all the examined farms. Overall, 780 litters of suckling piglets from 104 farms and 267 mother sows were examined. The faeces were analyzed with the modified McMaster method. Isopsora suis was found in 217 (27.8%) litters from 70 (66.7%) farms. Eimeria spp. was detected only in 20 (2.6%) litters from 12 (11.5%) farms. On the large farms I. suis infection was detected in 31.7% of litters whereas Eimeria spp. in 1.4% of them. On the medium sized farms I. suis was found in 18.1% of litters and Eimeria spp. in 0.6%. On the small farms I. suis was detected in only 13.2% of litters, whereas Eimeria spp. in as many as 28.9%. I. suis and Eimeria spp. oocysts were found in 18 (6.7%) and 16 (6%) sows respectively. From 72 sows producing I. suis infected piglets only 12 (16.7%) shed I. suis oocysts and as little as 4 (5.6%) shed Eimeria oocysts. In the remaining 56 sows (77.8%) no cases of coccidian infections were detected. The results of this investigation demonstrate the high prevalence of I. suis in suckling piglets on the large swine farms in Poland. #

The questions are ideal for polling students during lectures by means of a student response system that uses clicker remotes or smartphones running a suitable app. We describe our experiences implementing these clicker questions in a recent class and provide evidence of their effectiveness in terms of testing students' prior knowledge, gauging understanding of new material, increasing participation, and especially improving student satisfaction. Our conclusions are supported by a mid-semester student survey as well as anecdotal observations. The question bank has been released as an open-access educational resource under a Creative Commons license (BY-NC-SA) for free use by the mathematics community.
5c9372cbcf5acd3ce0e9ba3c3aa9e6a75bf9ed5a	Keywords: human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012 human coronavirus phylogenetic tree severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) a b s t r a c t Strains of human coronavirus (HCoV), namely HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and are the most common cause of non-rhinovirus-induced common cold in humans. Although the manifestations of coronavirus infection (i.e., rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough, nasal obstruction, and bronchitis) are generally self-limiting in healthy adults, certain strains such as HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection and febrile seizure, especially in infants, people of advanced age, and immunocompromised hosts. In 2003, a novel HCoV strain was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that began in Asia in 2002. The strain has hence been referred to as SARS-CoV. In addition, as recently as September 2012, another novel HCoV, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012, was identified as being the cause of fever, renal failure, pneumonia, and severe respiratory distress in two patients in the Middle East. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed highly conserved sequences of ORF1ab, spike, nucleocapsid, and envelope protein genes, but not membrane protein genes, between human betacoronavirus 2c EMC2012 and SARS-CoV. This review focuses on the differences in the genomes of certain HCoV strains, the pathogenesis of said strains, and recent developments in the establishment of therapeutic agents that might aid in the treatment of patients with such infections.
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	During outbreaks of deadly emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola, MERS-CoV) and bioterror threats (e.g., smallpox), actively monitoring potentially infected individuals aims to limit disease transmission and morbidity. Guidance issued by CDC on active monitoring was a cornerstone of its response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak. There are limited data on how to balance the costs and performance of this important public health activity. We present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern. We analyze data from New York City's Ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014-2016. For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at "low (but not zero) risk" and "some or high risk": 21 and 31 days, respectively. Extending our analysis to smallpox and MERS-CoV, we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to Ebola due to less variable incubation periods. Active monitoring can save lives but is expensive. Resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure-risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring.
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	Since the earliest descriptions of CMV reactivation in immune competent hosts, there have now been more than 20 studies demonstrating reactivation in non-immunesuppressed patients during critical illness . There is significant variability in estimated reactivation rates, most of which may be explained by methodology or kinetics. When these results are summarized, the median/mean rates of reactivation, respectively, are 24 and 23 % (Fig. 1a) . Abstract Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in nonimmune-suppressed critically ill patients is an area of increasing interest. CMV has long been appreciated as a pathogen in immunocompromised hosts. CMV reactivates in approximately one-third of latently infected nonimmune-suppressed hosts during critical illness; however, its role as a pathogen in these patients remains unclear. CMV reactivation has been linked to bacterial sepsis and likely results from inflammation, transient immune compromise, and viral epigenetic changes. While CMV may improve immune response to some bacterial infections, other data suggest that CMV induces exaggerated responses to severe infections that may be harmful to latently infected hosts. These results also suggest that previous infection history may explain significant differences seen between human septic responses and murine models of sepsis. While critically ill human hosts clearly have worse outcomes associated with CMV reactivation, determining causality remains an area of investigation, with randomized control trials currently being performed. Here we review the current literature and highlight areas for future investigation.
34ad10b8bf93bbe96efdb625808d7335ffec13c8	The use of Panax ginseng and Panax quinquefolius in traditional Chinese medicine dates back to about 5000 years ago thanks to its several beneficial and healing properties. Over the past few years, extensive preclinical and clinical evidence in the scientific literature worldwide has supported the beneficial effects of P. ginseng and P. quinquefolius in significant central nervous system, metabolic, infectious and neoplastic diseases. There has been growing research on ginseng because of its favorable pharmacokinetics, including the intestinal biotransformation which is responsible for the processing of ginsenosides -contained in the roots or extracts of ginseng -into metabolites with high pharmacological activity and how such principles act on numerous cell targets. The aim of this review is to provide a simple and extensive overview of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of P. ginseng and P. quinquefolius, focusing on the clinical evidence which has shown particular effectiveness in specific diseases, such as dementia, diabetes mellitus, respiratory infections, and cancer. Furthermore, the review will also provide data on toxicological factors to support the favorable safety profile of these medicinal plants.
aeae3e593ea4d3d0b59c83839837be75d2ea47d5	Virus recognition and induction of interferon (IFN) are critical components of the innate immune system. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) and RIG-I-like receptor families have been characterized as key players in RNA virus detection. Signaling cascades initiated by these receptors are crucial for establishment of an IFN signaling mediated antiviral state in infected and neighboring cells and containment of virus replication as well as initiation of the adaptive immune response. In this review, we focus on the diverse and overlapping functions of these receptors, their physiological importance, and respective viral inducers. We highlight the roles of TRL3, TLR7/8, retinoic acid inducible gene I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, and the RNA molecules responsible for activating these viral sensors.
327a206d906a71a562dffa0489a0a5d31d96219c	Host cells possess the metabolic assets required for viral infection. Recent studies indicate that control of the host's metabolic resources is a core host-pathogen interaction. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to usurp the host's metabolic resources, funneling them towards the production of virion components as well as the organization of specialized compartments for replication, maturation, and dissemination. Consequently, hosts have developed a variety of metabolic countermeasures to sense and resist these viral changes. The complex interplay between virus and host over metabolic control has only just begun to be deconvoluted. However, it is clear that virally induced metabolic reprogramming can substantially impact infectious outcomes, highlighting the promise of targeting these processes for antiviral therapeutic development.
2488fba7491c8e5e505f319481eef1394c355b51	Imaging techniques were used to document and monitor physical damage to the unique wall paintings at the Château de Germolles, Burgundy, France. Photogrammetry combined with scanning are the most appropriate techniques to monitor the evolution of microcrack networks in the cornice overhanging the paintings and preserved as a witness to 19th century additions. However, the application of these techniques was challenged due to the given constraints of a working height of 4 m and the required accuracy of a tenth of a millimetre. A special effort was therefore necessary to ensure sufficient stability of the acquisition protocol and to make it relevant during the four measurement campaigns planned over the two years of the project. The analysis of photogrammetric data has made it possible to document certain macro-deformations of the cornice according to the seasons of the year. The microcracks could be visualized and monitored from transformed 3D models of each segment for the different campaigns. The results obtained show only local movements, mainly on the walls that are most exposed to the specific climatic conditions of each season.
79dc90533e6cbbee93bbb3dffe18c25116f42b4a	Coronavirus disease of 2019 started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. In a few months, it has become a pandemic with devastating consequences for the global economy. By the end of June, with almost 2.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, United States is above other countries in the rankings. Furthermore, New York with more than 416 thousand cases is the epicenter of outbreak in the US and had more cases than any other countries in the world until first half of June. In this paper, we use a two-step Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) model to forecast the effect of the virus outbreak on the economic output of the New York state. In our model, we forecast the effect of the shutdown on New York's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) working with Unemployment Insurance Claim series representing a workforce factor, as well as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) ridership data indicating the economic activity. We predict annualized quarterly growth rate of real GDP to be between -3.99 to -4.299% for the first quarter and between -19.79 to -21.67% for the second quarter of 2020.
4a0de3f874ad61c102ddb195fc10aa721d9f5b85	Although primary genomic analysis has revealed that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) is a new type of coronavirus, the different protein trees published in previous reports have provided no conclusive evidence indicating the phylogenetic position of SARS CoV. To clarify the phylogenetic relationship between SARS CoV and other coronaviruses, we compiled a large data set composed of 7 concatenated protein sequences and performed comprehensive analyses, using the maximum-likelihood, Bayesian-inference, and maximum-parsimony methods. All resulting phylogenetic trees displayed an identical topology and supported the hypothesis that the relationship between SARS CoV and group 2 CoVs is monophyletic. Relationships among all major groups were well resolved and were supported by all statistical analyses. In the short amount of time since a novel coronavirus was identified as being the cause of the ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) around the world [1], several SARS coronavirus (CoV) isolates have been cloned, and several complete genomic sequences have been determined [2] [3] [4] . Preliminary sequence analyses have indicated that SARS CoV is a new type of coronavirus that does not belong to any group of coronaviruses yet characterized [2, 3] . However, the phylogenetic position and origin of SARS CoV remain elusive. Most reported phylogenetic analyses have been based on either individual proteins [2, 3, 5], short nucleotide sequences [1], or whole-genome similarity [6] . Although these analyses have not yielded conflicting results, the phylogenetic relationship between SARS CoV and
fd0814b06b01115f493a2c33c1a71ce42a64790d	 HCWs face a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during serving health care  Transmission may also occur in non-medical areas while speaking or eating  Proper use of PPE and basic infection control precautions are essential Specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care workers in a university hospital. Aim: To investigate the specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission among HCWs in a tertiary care university hospital. Upper respiratory samples of HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. A case-control study was conducted to explore the possible risk factors that lead to SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCWs. Of 703 HCWs screened between March 20 and May 20, 2020, 50 (7.1%) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 among physicians, nurses, cleaning personnel, and the other occupations were 6.3%, 8.0%, 9.1%, and 2.6%, respectively. The infection rate was 8.3% among HCWs who worked in COVID-19 units and 3.4% among those who did not work in COVID-19 units (RR = 2.449, CI = 1.062-5.649, p = .027). The presence of a SARS-CoV-2 positive person in the household (p = .016), inappropriate use of personnel protective equipment (PPE) while caring for patients with COVID-19 infection (p = .003), staying in the same personnel break room as an HCW without a medical mask for more than 15 minutes (p = .000), consuming food within one meter of an HCW (p = .003), and failure to keep a safe social distance from an HCW (p = .003) were statistically significant risk factors for infection. HCWs have a high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission while providing care to COVID-19 patients. Transmission may also occur in non-medical areas of the hospital while speaking or eating. Periodic screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 may enable early detection and isolation of infected HCWs.
7231a48f18f6185dfd2a8357c7f691216649caf1	There was rapid expansion and uptake of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, with ensuing reports of high patient satisfaction. However, the surgical patients' perspective on continuing virtual visits during the recovery phase and beyond has yet to be studied on a large scale. Objective: This study aims to determine the public's perception of telemedicine surgical consultations, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. With rapid expansion and uptake of telemedicine during the pandemic, many have posited that virtual visits will endure even as in-person visits are reinstated. The public's perception of telemedicine for an initial surgical consultation has not been previously studied. A 43-question survey assessed respondents' attitudes toward telemedicine for initial consultations with surgeons, both in the context of COVID-19 and during "normal circumstances." Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing marketplace. Results: Based on 1827 analyzable responses, we found that a majority (86%) of respondents reported being satisfied (either extremely or somewhat) with telemedicine encounters. Interestingly, preference for in-person versus virtual surgical consultation reflected access to care, with preference for telemedicine decreasing from 72% to 33% when COVID-related social Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. distancing ends. Preferences for virtual visits decreased with increasing complexity of the surgical intervention, even during the pandemic. A majority felt that "establishing trust and comfort" was best accomplished in person, and the vast majority felt it was important to meet their surgeons prior to the day of surgery. The public views telemedicine as an acceptable substitute for in-person visits, especially during the pandemic. However, it appears that an in-person interaction is still preferred when possible for surgical consultations. If telemedicine services are to persist beyond social distancing, further exploration of its impact on the patient-surgeon relationship will be needed. pandemic. However, it may be that an in-person interaction is still preferred when at all possiblefor initial surgical consultations. Ifexpanded telemedicine services are to persist beyond social distancing, the impact it could have on patient satisfaction and the therapeutic relationship between surgeons and their patients will need to be further explored.
586b2adbca2c4986b9939604184235b7d6ac080a	Aims: Severity of outcome in COVID-19 is disproportionately higher among the obese, males, smokers, those suffering from hypertension, kidney disease, coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined if serum levels of ACE2, the cellular entry point for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were altered in these high-risk groups. Methods: Associations of serum ACE2 levels to hypertension, T2D, obesity, CHD, smokers and males in a single center population-based study of 5457 Icelanders from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) of the elderly (mean age 75±6 years). Smokers, males, and individuals with T2D or obesity have altered serum levels of ACE2 that may influence productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in these high-risk groups. Conclusion: ACE2 levels are upregulated in some patient groups with comorbidities linked to COVID-19 and as such may have an emerging role as a circulating biomarker for severity of outcome in COVID-19.
281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	Background: Floods are some of the most common and destructive natural disasters in the world, potentially leading to both physical injuries and psychological disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD can damage functional capacity and interfere with social functioning. However, little is known about recovery from PTSD after floods. This study used 2013-2014 follow-up data on survivors of the 1998 Dongting Lake flood who were diagnosed with PTSD in 2000 to measure the prevalence rate of PTSD at follow-up and identify predictors of recovery from the PTSD diagnosis in 2000. Methods: Participants included survivors who had been diagnosed as having PTSD in 2000 after the 1998 Dongting Lake flood. PTSD at follow-up was reassessed using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version. Information on demographics, trauma-related stressors, post-trauma stressors, social support, and coping style were collected through face-to-face interviews. The association between the independent variables and PTSD at follow-up was analyzed using logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 201 participants with a PTSD diagnosis in 2000 were included in this study. A total of 19.4 % of the flood survivors with PTSD in 2000 continued to suffer from PTSD in 2013-2014. In the multivariable logistic regression model, individuals who had lost relatives (OR = 12.37, 95 % CI = 2.46-62.16), suffered from bodily injury (OR = 5.01, 95 % CI = 1.92-13.08), had a low level of social support (OR = 5.47, 95 % CI = 1.07-27.80), or had a negative coping style (OR = 4.92, 95 % CI = 1.89-12.81) were less likely to recover from PTSD. Conclusions: The prevalence rate of PTSD at follow-up indicates that natural disasters such as floods may have a negative influence on survivors' mental health for an extended period of time. Individuals who have lost relatives, suffered from bodily injury, had a low level of social support, or had a negative coping style were less likely to recover from PTSD. Therefore, effective psychological intervention measures are necessary for facilitating the recovery process from PTSD, especially for individuals with adverse prognostic factors.
d8adb6cbcaecb60b51fafaf0d20c1b1218207fc0	Several studies suggest that the open reading frame 3 (ORF3) gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is related to viral infectivity and pathogenicity, but its function remains unknown. Here, we propose a structure model of the ORF3 protein consisting of four TM domains and forming a tetrameric assembly. ORF3 protein can be detected in PEDV-infected cells and it functions as an ion channel in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast. Mutation analysis showed that Tyr170 in TM4 is important for potassium channel activity. Furthermore, viral production is reduced in infected Vero cells when ORF3 gene is silenced by siRNA. Interestingly, the ORF3 gene from an attenuated PEDV encodes a truncated protein with 49 nucleotide deletions, which lacks the ion channel activity.
ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802	Background: Viral respiratory infections have been associated with up to 80% of wheezing episodes and asthma exacerbations. However, studies on the role of these viruses in asthmatic patients in the interval between exacerbations are sparse. This study aimed to determine the presence of respiratory viruses, without symptoms of infection, in the airways of young asthmatics as compared to healthy controls. Material and Methods: Patients 10e35 years of age with stable asthma and a group of healthy controls were analyzed regarding the presence of RNA from common respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates by PCR. Self-reported asthma control and quality of life, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), spirometry, and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were recorded. Blood samples were collected to assess IgE sensitisation and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels. Results: In 354 patients with asthma and 108 healthy controls, human rhinovirus (HRV) was the only virus detected (4.5% of asthmatics vs. 0.9% of controls; p ¼ 0.08). HRV þ asthma patients had a higher degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation (median 37.7 vs. 10.4 kU A /L, p ¼ 0.04), and a tendency for higher levels of serum ECP (median 17.2 vs. 12.6 mg/L, p ¼ 0.07), as compared to their HRV À counterparts. Conclusions: Absence of symptoms of respiratory tract infection notwithstanding, HRV seems to be more prevalent in the airways of adolescents and young adults with asthma and a high degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation than in controls. The presence of HRV seems also to be related to systemic eosinophilic inflammation despite ongoing treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.
2f254a3799bc354fda7890b34b1d2bea1151e58f	Most traditional vaccines are composed either of a whole pathogen or its parts; these vaccines, however, are not always effective and can even be harmful. As such, additional agents known as adjuvants are necessary to increase vaccine safety and efficacy. This review summarizes the potential of biodegradable materials, including synthetic and natural polymers, for vaccine delivery. These materials are highly biocompatible and have minimal toxicity, and most biomaterial-based vaccines delivering antigens or adjuvants have been shown to improve immune response, compared to formulations consisting of the antigen alone. Therefore, these materials can be applied in modern vaccine development.
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	In many enveloped virus families, including HIV and HSV, a crucial, yet unexploited, step in the viral life cycle is releasing particles from the infected cell membranes. This release process is mediated by host ESCRT complex proteins, which is recruited by viral structural proteins and provides the mechanical means for membrane scission and subsequent viral budding. The prazole drug, tenatoprazole, was previously shown to bind to ESCRT complex member Tsg101 and quantitatively block the release of infectious HIV-1 from cells in culture. In this report we show that tenatoprazole and a related prazole drug, ilaprazole, effectively block infectious Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1/2 release from Vero cells in culture. By electron microscopy, we found that both prazole drugs block the release of HSV particles from the cell nuclear membrane resulting in their accumulation in the nucleus. Ilaprazole also quantitatively blocks the release of HIV-1 from 293T cells with an EC50 of 0.8 µM, which is more potent than tenatoprazole. Finally, we synthesized and tested multiple novel prazole-based analogs that demonstrate both binding to Tsg101 and inhibition of viral egress in the nanomolar range of HIV-1 from 293T cells. Our results indicate that prazole-based compounds may represent a class of drugs with potential to be broad-spectrum antiviral agents against multiple enveloped viruses, by interrupting cellular Tsg101 interaction with maturing virus, thus blocking the budding process that releases particles from the cell. These results provide the basis for the development of drugs that target enveloped virus budding that can be used ultimately to control multiple virus infections in humans.
4e1ef6274be3b2dc2398d24246bd9a98b8df129c	Chest CT is thought to be sensitive but less specific in diagnosing the 2019 coronavirus disease . The diagnostic value of CT is unclear. We aimed to compare the performance of CT and initial RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epicentre-Wuhan, China. Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled. Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus. With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed. A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. Results 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled. 34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT. The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa of 0.69. No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT. The comprehensive strategy had a higher sensitivity of 94% (32/34). Initial RT-PCR and chest CT had comparable diagnostic performance in identification of suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epidemic center. To compensate potential risk of false-negative PCR, chest CT should be applied for clinically suspected patients with negative 4 initial RT-PCR.
cf947a2dab50e962ae6ea2339d7061fafb01e48a	Estimating the number of people affected by COVID-19 is crucial in deciding which public health policies to follow. The authorities in different countries carry out mortality counts. We propose that the mortality reported in each country can be used to create an index of the number of actual cases at a given time. The specificity of whether or not deaths are rapid or not by COVID-19 also affects the number of actual cases. The number of days between the declaration of illness and death varies between 12 and 18 days. For a delay of 18 days, and using an estimated mortality rate of 2%, the number of cases in April 2020 in Tunisia would be 5 580 people. The pessimistic scenario predicts 22 320 infected people, and the most optimistic predicts 744 (which is the number of reported cases on April 12, 2020). Modeling the occurrence of COVID-19 cases is critical to assess the impact of policies to prevent the spread of the virus.
2ad4a32315e1ce061a37ba49106dc886512b5883	Novel Coronavirus Disease has become a rapidly growing pandemic involving several nations. It is of serious concern and extreme challenge not only to the health personnel but also to the countries for containment. The causative organism is SARS-CoV-2, RNA virus of subgenus Sarbecovirus, similar to the SARS virus, and seventh member of the human coronavirus family responsible for this zoonotic infection. It binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE-2) receptor and causes constitutional and respiratory symptoms. The major mode of transmission is human to human and the median incubation period is 4 days. The most common symptom as studied from various cohorts of COVID-19 patients are fever (83-98%) followed by fatigue (70%) and dry cough (59%); gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively uncommon differentiating it from SARS and MERS. Most of the SAR-CoV-2 infection are mild (80%) with a usual recovery period of 2 weeks. COVID-19 commonly affects males in the middle age and elderly age group, with highest case fatality (8-15%) among those aged >80 years. The disease begins with fever, dry cough, fatigue and myalgia progressing to dyspnoea and ARDS over 6 and 8 days post exposure, respectively. Underlying co-morbidities increase mortality in COVID-19. Poor prognostic factors are elderly, co-morbidities, severe lymphopaenia, high CRP and D-dimer >1 μg/L. The overall mortality rate ranges from 1.5 to 3.6%. COVID-19 has to be differen-55 tiated from other viral and bacterial pneumonias as they are more common among healthy adults. Despite constant and vigorous efforts by researchers and health agencies, we are far from containment, cure or prevention by vaccine; hence right information and stringent prevention and control measures are the only weapon in the armoury to combat the ongoing infection.
d83996a64e87a5a3ecb6597033d0a4c20e740d9a	Objectives/Hypothesis: To measure the populations of 36 fungi in the homes and sinuses of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and non-CRS patients. Study Design: Single-blind cross-sectional study. Methods: Populations of 36 fungi were measured in sinus samples and in the home vacuum cleaner dust of CRS (n ¼ 73) and non-CRS patients (n ¼ 16) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Etest strips containing amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole, and voriconazole were used to test the susceptibility of seven potentially relevant fungi. Results: Seven fungi (Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides types 1 and 2, Cladosporium herbarum, Penicillium brevicompactum, Penicillium crustosum, and Penicillium chrysogenum type 2) were discovered at very high concentrations in some CRS patients. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of these seven fungi demonstrated species specific sensitivities. Four CRS patients with marked elevations of fungal populations in their sinus samples underwent endoscopic sinus surgery. After surgical treatment, the fungal populations were reduced by several orders of magnitude. Conclusions: Seven fungi were found in very high concentrations in the sinuses of some CRS patients. Not one of the five common antifungal agents could control all seven of these fungi based on in vitro tests.

6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	Monostroma nitidum is a green single-cell layered algae that grows on the southwest coast of Japan. It is often used for salad ingredients, boiled tsukudani, soups, etc., due to its health benefits. M. nitidum is composed of many cell aggregates, and the various substances that fill the intercellular space are dietary fibers, vitamins, and minerals. Rhamnan sulfate (RS), a sulfated polysaccharide, is main the component of the fiber extracted from M. nitidum. Recently, some biological properties of RS have been demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies that probably protect human subjects from viruses and ameliorate vascular dysfunction caused by metabolic disorders, especially lifestyle-related diseases. In this review, we focus on the antithrombotic effects of RS and introduce its antiviral and other biological activities. Figure 1. (a) Monostroma nitidum; (b) longitudinal section of the tissue, which is composed of a single layer of cells; (c) tissue consists of many cell aggregates; bar indicates 20 μm. M. nitidum grows wild in shallow waters along the Pacific coast of Japan (Kii Peninsula, Kyushu, and Nansei Islands), Korean Peninsula, and Southern China. In Japan, seaweed farming is also being practiced in the southwest coastal areas of Mie, Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Nagasaki, and Okinawa prefectures. It is particularly popular in Matoya Bay, Ago Bay, Ise Bay, and Gokasho Bay in Mie Prefecture, accounting for about 70% of the total production in Japan. M. nitidum is a healthpromoting food that contains dietary fibers consisting of polysaccharides, minerals, and proteins, and it has been used extensively for nori boiled in soy sauce, miso soups, and salads. Cell walls of M. nitidum contain a large amount of rhamnan sulfate (RS), a sulfated polysaccharide [4, 5] . Although this macromolecule is poorly soluble in water, it can be solubilized and decomposed into smaller molecules by treating M. nitidum with hot water. The obtained extract is purified by anion-exchange resin column chromatography; sulfated substances bind to the column and are subsequently eluted from the column by increasing the concentration of sodium chloride. This method produces a highly purified RS [5] . Figure 2a shows hot water extract from the intercellular substance of M. nitidum, and Figure 2b shows highly purified RS from M. nitidum. Figure 2. (a) Hot-water extract from intercellular substance of M. nitidum; (b) highly purified rhamnan sulfate from M. nitidum. Purified RS is a macromolecular polysaccharide with a molecular weight of tens of thousands to millions. It consists of a polysaccharide with long linear chain structures of α-1,3-linked L-rhamnose connected with α-1,2-linked branched chains, to which several sulfate groups bind ( Figure 3) [6,7]; sulfate groups account for about 25% of M. nitidum-derived RS [8].
776a2bf0b1763d20b33b2f93f835170a888dfc39	Continuity and differentiation elements in the administrative reform cycles are considered from the perspective of implementation, and its gaps. The reformist seasons of the last 25 years mostly shared the same principles, goals and weaknesses in their implementation phases. The vicious cycle of administrative reforms has not been defused: the widespread disagreement in the policy community against further waves of comprehensive reform is an indicator of a persistent low degree of practical implementation, and rather of the prevalence of contradictory effects with respect to reforming principles and goals, like the performance evaluation introduced by statute in 2009. Creeping resistance within administrations is a constant presence, apparently unaffected by several waves of normative innovation. Notwithstanding the recent call for "concreteness" of the Five-Star Movement and League "government of change", we find that the lack of empirical, in-depth organizational analysis gives the real measure of current complexity to be dealt with.
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	Single-stranded RNA viruses such as alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles viruses and rhabdoviruses are characterized by their capacity of highly efficient self-amplification of RNA in host cells, which make them attractive vehicles for vaccine development. Particularly, alphaviruses and flaviviruses can be administered as recombinant particles, layered DNA/RNA plasmid vectors carrying the RNA replicon and even RNA replicon molecules. Self-amplifying RNA viral vectors have been used for high level expression of viral and tumor antigens, which in immunization studies have elicited strong cellular and humoral immune responses in animal models. Vaccination has provided protection against challenges with lethal doses of viral pathogens and tumor cells. Moreover, clinical trials have demonstrated safe application of RNA viral vectors and even promising results in rhabdovirus-based phase III trials on an Ebola virus vaccine. Preclinical and clinical applications of self-amplifying RNA viral vectors have proven efficient for vaccine development and due to the presence of RNA replicons, amplification of RNA in host cells will generate superior immune responses with significantly reduced amounts of RNA delivered. The need for novel and efficient vaccines has become even more evident due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has further highlighted the urgency in challenging emerging diseases. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 5130 2 of 29 tolerability profile [5] . Functional antibodies against the viral antigen could be induced and boosted when administered with a needle-free device but not when a needle-syringe was used. In the context of mRNA-based vaccines, self-replicating RNA viruses present an interesting and attractive alternative as described below [6]. The common feature of self-amplifying RNA viruses is their single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome embedded in a capsid and envelope protein structure [6] . In the case of alphaviruses and flaviviruses, the ssRNA genome is of positive polarity in contrast to measles viruses (MVs) and rhabdoviruses, which carry a negative sense ssRNA genome. In any case, the RNA genome of self-amplifying RNA viruses can act directly in the cytoplasm without any need of nucleic acid delivery to the nucleus. In the case of positive polarity, the translation can be initiated directly from the incoming ssRNA genome [7], whereas negative sense RNA molecules require the generation of a positive strand RNA template [8]. All self-amplifying RNA viruses initially express their nonstructural genes resulting in the formation of the RNA replication complex (RNA replicon), responsible for extreme RNA replication in infected host cells [7] . It has been estimated that 200,000 copies of RNA are made from a single RNA molecule, providing together with strong subgenomic promoters the basis for extremely high expression levels of viral proteins. This feature has been taken advantage of in expression vectors engineered from self-amplifying RNA viruses, which have been applied for mammalian and non-mammalian cell lines, primary cells and in vivo [9] . Moreover, self-amplifying RNA virus vectors have been used for vaccine development, targeting both infectious diseases and different types of cancers. In this review, the basic function of self-replicating RNA virus vectors is described, and various preclinical and clinical applications are presented. Although efficient expression systems have been developed for alphaviruses, flaviviruses, MVs and rhabdoviruses, the differences in the polarity of the ssRNA genome have required alternative engineering. In the case of alphaviruses and flaviviruses, the procedure is straightforward, whereas MVs and rhabdoviruses require the utilization of packaging cell lines and reverse genetics. For simplicity, the focus is here on the illustration of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV)-based expression system, one of the most commonly applied alphavirus expression systems (Figure 1) . Alphaviruses belong to the family of Togaviruses [7] . Particularly, SFV [10], Sindbis virus (SIN) [11] and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) [12] have been used for the engineering of expression vector systems. In this context, engineering of an expression vector carrying the SFV nonstructural protein genes (nsP1-4), where the gene of interest can be inserted downstream of the strong 26S subgenomic promoter allows in vitro transcribed RNA to be directly translated in cell lines and in vivo ( Figure 1) . Alternatively, replacement of the SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase promoter upstream of the nsP1-4 region with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter permits direct use of plasmid DNA in vitro or in vivo [13] . Another possibility is to co-transfect in vitro transcribed RNA from the expression vector and a helper vector expressing the SFV structural protein genes into mammalian host cells for production of replication deficient SFV particles. The reason for replication deficiency relates to the presence of the packaging signal in the nsP2 region of the expression vector, which prevents the packaging of the RNA from the helper vector [14] . Additionally, to reduce the formation of any replication proficient SFV particles, the second generation pSFV-Helper 2 vector was engineered [15] . Furthermore, for total elimination of RNA recombination and generation of replication proficient SFV particles a two-helper system with the capsid and spike protein genes on separated vectors was applied [16] . Finally, a full-length SFV genome with a second 26S subgenomic promoter and gene of interest introduced either downstream of the nsP genes or the structural genes can be applied, keeping in mind that replication proficient particles will be generated, obviously enhancing biosafety risks. In any case, the options and flexibility are excellent as alphavirus vectors can be used for vaccine development in the form of naked RNA replicons, DNA plasmid vectors and recombinant viral particles as described in more detail in the next sections.

Introduction of an FMDV-2A protease sequence in the KUN vector will allow removal of remaining KUN flanking regions from the recombinant product [18] . Virus production from KUN vectors has been facilitated by the engineering of a packaging cell line [19] . In addition to KUN vectors, expression systems for West Nile virus [20, 21] , yellow fever virus [22,23], dengue virus [24,25] and tick-borne encephalitis [26, 27] have been engineered.

Medical management is critical to actualizing the individual or family's intent to donate and maximizing the benefi t of that intent. This interval of care in the PICU begins with brain death and consent to donation and culminates with surgical organ procurement. During this phase, risks for hemodynamic instability and compromise of end organ function are high. The brain dead organ donor is in a distinct and challenging pathophysiologic condition that culminates in multifactorial shock. The potential benefi ts of aggressive medical management of the organ donor may include increased number of donors providing transplantable organs and increased number of organs transplanted per donor. This may improve graft function, graft survival, and patient survival in those transplanted. In this chapter, pathophysiologic changes occurring after brain death are reviewed. General and organ specifi c donor management strategies and logistic considerations are discussed. There is a signifi cant opportunity for enhancing donor multi-organ function and improving organ utilization with appropriate PICU management.

e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important animal and human emerging and re-emerging pathogens that are responsible for yearly seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. IAVs cause a wide range of clinical illnesses, from relatively mild infections by seasonal strains, to acute respiratory distress during infections with highly pathogenic avian IAVs (HPAI). For this study, we infected A549 human lung cells with lab prototype A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), a seasonal H1N1 (RV733), the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm09), or with two avian strains, an H5N1 HPAI strain or an H7N9 strain that has low pathogenicity in birds but high pathogenicity in humans. We used a newly-developed aptamer-based multiplexed technique (SOMAscan ® ) to examine >1300 human lung cell proteins affected by the different IAV strains, and identified more than 500 significantly dysregulated cellular proteins. Our analyses indicated that the avian strains induced more profound changes in the A549 global proteome compared to all tested low-pathogenicity H1N1 strains. The PR8 strain induced a general activation, primarily by upregulating many immune molecules, the seasonal RV733 and pdm09 strains had minimal effect upon assayed molecules, and the avian strains induced significant downregulation, primarily in antimicrobial response, cardiovascular and post-translational modification systems. Viruses 2019, 11, 1028 2 of 16 and the pandemic H1N1 2009 strains), H2N2 and H3N2. There has also been a sporadic but highly lethal spread of H5N1 and H7N9 from birds to humans [9] . Several anti-viral strategies, including small molecule inhibitors and yearly re-formulated vaccines, have been developed to combat IAV, but the virus extensive genetic plasticity, caused by an error-prone polymerase and capacity to mix genetic content, often leads to resistance to virus-targeted anti-viral strategies. Because all viruses are obligate parasites, and must therefore make widespread use of host cell machinery, an alternate anti-viral strategy that is being explored would be to elucidate host factors that are required by, and modulated by, the virus, for its successful pathogenicity and propagation. We [10-13] and others [14] [15] [16] [17] have used mass-spectrometry (MS)-based non-biased quantitative strategies to measure how IAV affects the host cell proteome. Each of these assays identified thousands of cellular proteins, and collectively, these studies have determined dysregulation of various pathways, such as acetylation, cell structure, defense responses, protein binding, responses to stress, stimulus and virus, alternative splicing, localization, transport, protein binding and nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism. However, these non-biased global types of strategies have a few limitations. First, since the more abundant proteins are likely to be identified by MS, the less abundant proteins, many of which play key functions, are more likely to be missed. In addition, there usually is less than 100% overlap between replicate MS-identified samples. Multiplex protein arrays have the potential to overcome such limitations, but most are antibody-based and currently limited to a few hundred analytes. A newly developed proteomics technology, called SOMAscan ® , and developed by SomaLogics, Inc. (Boulder, CO, USA) provides an alternate strategy to simultaneously sample >1300 specific proteins of interest [18] [19] [20] in up to~90 samples. SOMAmers ® are chemically modified slow off-rate aptamers (short nucleotides) to stabilize protein binding capacity. We used this technology to complement our earlier quantitative MS-based studies and identified numerous low-abundant proteins, including cytokines and chemokines that are differentially dysregulated by IAV associated with no or mild human infection, compared to H5N1 and H7N9 strains associated with highly pathogenic human infection.
bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5	The current retrospective study examined thought control strategies, or cognitive techniques individuals use to deal with unpleasant thoughts following stressful events, as potential mediators of adjustment in young women with histories of child sexual abuse (CSA). In a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self-reported on abuse experiences, thought control strategies, and current trauma symptoms, several key findings emerged: (i) Greater severity of the CSA event was associated with greater reported use of worry and punishment strategies and less use of social control strategies; (ii) Increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the CSA event was associated with greater levels of trauma symptoms, while increased use of social control strategies following the CSA event was associated with lower levels of trauma symptoms; and (iii) Worry, punishment, and social control strategies served as mediators between CSA severity and trauma symptoms. The results suggest that thought control strategies, specifically increased worry and punishment, and decreased social control, play a vital role in understanding adjustment after CSA. Future research should examine the roles of these cognitive control strategies as possible avenues of intervention following CSA.
558198b07f72e5bf554967b826db5eada9243c83	Last-mile logistics is regarded as an essential yet highly expensive component of parcel logistics. In dense urban environments, this is partially caused by inherent inefficiencies due to traffic congestion and the disparity and accessibility of customer locations. In parcel logistics, access hubs are facilities supporting relay-based last-mile activities by offering temporary storage locations enabling the decoupling of last-mile activities from the rest of the urban distribution chain. This paper focuses on a novel tactical problem: the geographically dynamic deployment of pooled relocatable storage capacity modules in an urban parcel network operating under space-time uncertainty. In particular, it proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization model for the access hub dynamic pooled capacity deployment problem with synchronization of underlying operations through travel time estimates, and a solution approach based on a rolling horizon algorithm with lookahead and a benders decomposition able to solve large scale instances of a real-sized megacity. Numerical results, inspired by the case of a large parcel express carrier, are provided to evaluate the computational performance of the proposed approach and suggest up to 28% last-mile cost savings and 26% capacity savings compared to a static capacity deployment strategy.
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	Previous studies have found large variations in the COVID-19 infection fatality rate (IFR). This study hypothesized that IFR would be influenced by COVID-19 epidemic intensity. We tested the association between epidemic intensity and IFR using serological results from a recent large SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey (N = 60,983) in 19 Spanish regions. The infection fatality rate for Spain as a whole was 1.15% and varied between 0.13% and 3.25% in the regions (median 1.07%, IQR 0.69-1.32%). The IFR by region was positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (rho = 0.54; p = 0.0162), cases/100,000 (rho = 0.75; p = 0.002), hospitalizations/100,000 (rho = 0.78; p = 0.0001), mortality/100,000 (rho = 0.77; p = 0.0001) and case fatality rate (rho = 0.49; p = 0.0327). These results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 IFR is not fixed. The Spanish regions with more rapid and extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 had higher IFRs. These findings are compatible with the theory that slowing the spread of COVID-19 down reduces the IFR and case fatality rate via preventing hospitals from being overrun, and thus allowing better and lifesaving care.

ff6b55c00278cf8081dec1ad430940165b23d91e	Background: We describe human rhinovirus (HRV) detections in SaKaeo province, Thailand. Methods: From September 1, 2003-August 31, 2005, we tested hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory illness and outpatient controls without fever or respiratory symptoms for HRVs with polymerase chain reaction and molecularlytyped select HRVs. We compared HRV detection among hospitalized patients and controls and estimated enrollment adjusted incidence. Results: HRVs were detected in 315 (16%) of 1919 hospitalized patients and 27 (9.6%) of 280 controls. Children had the highest frequency of HRV detections (hospitalized: ,1 year: 29%, 1-4 year: 29%, $65 years: 9%; controls: ,1 year: 24%, 1-4 year: 14%, $65 years: 2.8%). Enrollment adjusted hospitalized HRV detection rates were highest among persons aged ,1 year (1038/100,000 persons/year), 1-4 years (457), and $65 years (71). All three HRV species were identified, HRV-A was the most common species in most age groups including children aged ,1 year (61%) and all adult age groups. HRV-C was the most common species in the 1-4 year (51%) and 5-19 year age groups (54%). Compared to controls, hospitalized adults ($19 years) and children were more likely to have HRV detections (odds ratio [OR]: 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 15.8; OR: 2.0, CI: 1.2, 3.3, respectively) and hospitalized children were more likely to have HRV-A (OR 1.7, CI: 0.8, 3.5) or HVR-C (OR 2.7, CI: 1.2, 5.9) detection. Conclusions: HRV rates were high among hospitalized children and the elderly but asymptomatic children also had substantial HRV detection. HRV (all species), and HRV-A and HRV-C detections were epidemiologically-associated with hospitalized illness. Treatment or prevention modalities effective against HRV could reduce hospitalizations due to HRV in Thailand.

Dual Karush-Kuhn-Tucker second-order sufficient conditions are provided too. We suppose that the objective function and the active inequality constraints are only locally Lipschitz in the primal necessary conditions and only strictly differentiable in sense of Clarke at the extremum point in the dual conditions.

f3c10470815b973ad8057f0ab1b878fa71dfea3e	We briefly frame challenges and steps to overcoming those challenges in delivering care for patients with bipolar disorder via telehealth or telephone during COVID-19. Telehealth provides an invaluable opportunity to provide care for patients even under circumstances of social isolation. The issues discussed in Accepted Article this debate are intended to guide and assist clinicians, both in assessment and intervention, in adjusting to the use of virtual care for patients with bipolar disorder.
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	Mutual Information (MI) based feature selection methods are popular due to their ability to capture the nonlinear relationship among variables. However, existing works rarely address the error (bias) that occurs due to the use of finite samples during the estimation of MI. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing methods address the bias issue for the high-order interaction term which is essential for better approximation of joint MI. In this paper, we first calculate the amount of bias of this term. Moreover, to select features using χ 2 based search, we also show that this term follows χ 2 distribution. Based on these two theoretical results, we propose Discretization and feature Selection based on bias corrected Mutual information (DSbM). DSbM is extended by adding simultaneous forward selection and backward elimination (DSbM fb ). We demonstrate the superiority of DSbM over four state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and the number of selected features on twenty benchmark datasets. Experimental results also demonstrate that DSbM outperforms the existing methods in terms of accuracy, Pareto Optimality and Friedman test. We also observe that compared to DSbM, in some dataset DSbM fb selects fewer features and increases accuracy.

Rapid assessment of the cardiorespiratory function to monitor disease progression and guide treatment is essential. Therefore, we have designed the COVID-US: a simplified cardiopulmonary ultrasound approach to use in suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients, to aid front-line health workers in their decision-making in a surge crisis.
c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec	Indomethacin, a potent nonsteroidal inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase (cyclooxygenase) reduced yields of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in HEp-2 cells more than 99% if added to cultures at levels of lo-' M either before or after infection. Other permissive cell lines differed according to the treatment period and drug level required for restricting productive infections. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal. Strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin, which does not block cyclooxygenase function, was inactive. Enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin-treated HEp-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin El, cyclic AMP, or insulin. Conversely, indomethacin-treated cells remained restrictive for VSV if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA (actinomycin D or mitomycin C), messenger RNA synthesis (cu-amanitin), or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with mitomycin C markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV from a 90% inhibitory dose of about 10e4 M to one of lo-' M or lower. These findings suggest that preexisting host factors essential for replication of WV, although rendered nonfunctional by the drug indomethacin, can be replenished unless their synthesis is blocked by various classes of metabolic inhibitors. 345

dfe3e0bb96147cbc06e4cf7b5f3635cda8d13106	Objectives: This study aimed to assess the usefulness of a new chest X-ray scoring system, the 31 Brixia score, to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus , all CXR reports containing the Brixia score 34 were retrieved. We enrolled only hospitalized Caucasian patients with COVID-19 for whom the 35 final outcome was available. For each patient, age, sex, underlying comorbidities, 36 immunosuppressive therapies and the CXR report containing the highest score were considered for 37 the analysis. These independent variables were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression 38 model to extract the predictive factors for in-hospital mortality. 39 Results: 302 Caucasian patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. In the 40 multivariable logistic regression model, only Brixia score, patient age, and conditions that induced 41 immunosuppression were the significant predictive factors for in-hospital mortality. On receiver 42 operating characteristic curve analyses, the optimal cutoff values for Brixia score and patient age 43 were 8 points and 71 years, respectively. Three different models that included the Brixia score 44 showed excellent predictive power. 45 Conclusions: Patients with high Brixia score and at least one other predictive factor had the highest 46 risk of in-hospital death. 47 48 Key words 49 SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Chest X-ray; Scoring System 50 51 102 103 Discussion 104 In our large study cohort, the in-hospital mortality was 21.5%, and higher in men than in women. Multivariable analysis showed that only Brixia score, patient age, and immunosuppressive 106 conditions were the risk factors strongly associated with in-hospital mortality.
efd3a0adec621ead095b64ec9a3440f12af64ba8	The human gut microbiota has been the interest of extensive research in recent years and our knowledge on using the potential capacity of these microbes are growing rapidly. Microorganisms colonized throughout the gastrointestinal tract of human are coevolved through symbiotic relationship and can influence physiology, metabolism, nutrition and immune functions of an individual. The gut microbes are directly involved in conferring protection against pathogen colonization by inducing direct killing, competing with nutrients and enhancing the response of the gut-associated immune repertoire. Damage in the microbiome (dysbiosis) is linked with several life-threatening outcomes viz. inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, obesity, allergy, and auto-immune disorders. Therefore, the manipulation of human gut microbiota came out as a potential choice for therapeutic intervention of the several human diseases. Herein, we review significant studies emphasizing the influence of the gut microbiota on the regulation of host responses in combating infectious and inflammatory diseases alongside describing the promises of gut microbes as future therapeutics.
537abde4c5b849f55e62ff102f4f91dfca742ff7	A dataset of 103 SARS-CoV isolates (101 human patients and 2 palm civets) was investigated on different aspects of genome polymorphism and isolate classification. The number and the distribution of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions and deletions, with respect to a "profile", were determined and discussed ("profile" being a sequence containing the most represented letter per position). Distribution of substitution categories per codon positions, as well as synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in coding regions of annotated isolates, was determined, along with amino acid (a.a.) property changes. Similar analysis was performed for the spike (S) protein in all the isolates (55 of them being predicted for the first time). The ratio Ka/Ks confirmed that the S gene was subjected to the Darwinian selection during virus transmission from animals to humans. Isolates from the dataset were classified according to genome polymorphism and genotypes. Genome polymorphism yields to two groups, one with a small number of SNVs and another with a large number of SNVs, with up to four subgroups with respect to insertions and deletions. We identified three basic nine-locus genotypes: TTTT/TTCGG, CGCC/TTCAT, and TGCC/TTCGT, with four subgenotypes. Both classifications proposed are in accordance with the new insights into possible epidemiological spread, both in space and time.
0c377dd7decb2c054f500adceb434c1aeb573434	Hydroxytyrosol and dihydrocaffeoyl catechols with lipophilic properties have been synthesized in high yield using tyrosinase immobilized on multi-walled carbon nanotubes by the Layer-by-Layer technique. All synthesized catechols were evaluated against a large panel of DNA and RNA viruses, including Poliovirus type 1, Echovirus type 9, Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Coxsackievirus type B3 (Cox B3), Adenovirus type 2 and type 5 and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). A significant antiviral activity was observed in the inhibition of HSV-1, HSV-2, Cox B3 and CMV. The mechanism of action of the most active dihydrocaffeoyl derivative was investigated against a model of HSV-1 infection.
5d5a8cbd97e16906a58f62f9ab5a01c044ab2af5	Isoxazolidine analogues of homonucleos(t)ides were synthesized from nucleobase-derived nitrones 20a-20e (uracil, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, thymine, adenine) employing 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with allyl alcohol as well as with alkenylphosphonates (allyl-, allyloxymethyl-and vinyloxymethyl-and vinylphosphonate). Besides reactions with vinylphosphonate the additions proceeded regioselectively to produce mixtures of major cis and minor trans 3,5-disubstituted isoxazolidines (d.e. 28e82%). From vinylphosphonate up to 10% of 3,4-disubstituted isoxazolidines was additionally produced. Vicinal couplings, shielding effects and 2D NOE correlations were employed in configurational assignments as well as in conformational analysis to find out preferred conformations for several isoxazolidines and to observe anomeric effects (pseudoaxial orientation of phosphonylmethoxy groups) for those obtained from vinyloxymethylphosphonate. None of the tested compounds were endowed in vitro with antiviral activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses at subtoxic concentrations (up to 250 mM) nor exhibited antiproliferative activity towards L1210, CEM, and HeLa cells (IC 50 ¼ !100 mM).
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	Primates along with many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic ecological conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats. One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest-savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non-tree species (liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non-tree plants have been defined as fallback and non-preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forestsavannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. Am. J. Primatol. 77:948-962, 2015.

ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	For over 30 years, HIV/AIDS has wreaked havoc in the world. In the absence of an effective vaccine for HIV, development of new anti-HIV agents is urgently needed. We previously identified the antiviral activities of the scorpion-venom-peptidederived mucroporin-M1 for three RNA viruses (measles viruses, SARS-CoV, and H5N1). In this investigation, a panel of scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives were designed and chosen for assessment of their anti-HIV activities. A new scorpion venom peptide derivative Kn2-7 was identified as the most potent anti-HIV-1 peptide by screening assays with an EC 50 value of 2.76 mg/ml (1.65 mM) and showed low cytotoxicity to host cells with a selective index (SI) of 13.93. Kn2-7 could inhibit all members of a standard reference panel of HIV-1 subtype B pseudotyped virus (PV) with CCR5-tropic and CXCR4tropic NL4-3 PV strain. Furthermore, it also inhibited a CXCR4-tropic replication-competent strain of HIV-1 subtype B virus. Binding assay of Kn2-7 to HIV-1 PV by Octet Red system suggested the anti-HIV-1 activity was correlated with a direct interaction between Kn2-7 and HIV-1 envelope. These results demonstrated that peptide Kn2-7 could inhibit HIV-1 by direct interaction with viral particle and may become a promising candidate compound for further development of microbicide against HIV-1.
3edea664551396420ae233d6951c3a8a71c2870e	Human Bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in 2005 using a molecular virus screening technique. It is often found in respiratory samples and is a likely cause for respiratory diseases in children. HBoV is distributed worldwide and has been found not only in respiratory samples, but also in feces, urine and serum. HBoV infections are mostly found in young children and coinfections with other respiratory viruses are often found, exacerbating the efforts to link HBoV to specific symptoms. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of recent HBoV research, highlighting some recent findings.
cb04b7111c59c623bd68cf0441f18ccfcddb5b40	Throughout the rabies virus (RABV) infectious cycle, host-virus interactions define its capacity to replicate, escape the immune response, and spread. As phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism involved in most cellular processes, kinases represent a target of choice to identify host factors required for viral replication. A kinase and phosphatase small interfering RNA (siRNA) high-content screening was performed on a fluorescent protein-recombinant field isolate (Tha RABV). We identified 57 high-confidence key host factors important for RABV replication with a readout set at 18 h postinfection and 73 with a readout set at 36 h postinfection, including 24 common factors at all stages of the infection. Amongst them, gene clusters of the most prominent pathways were determined. Up to 15 mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) and effectors, including MKK7 (associated with Jun N-terminal protein kinase [JNK] signalization) and DUSP5, as well as 17 phosphatidylinositol (PI)-related proteins, including PIP5K1C and MTM1, were found to be involved in the later stage of RABV infection. The importance of these pathways was further validated, as small molecules Ro 31-8820 and PD 198306 inhibited RABV replication in human neurons. IMPORTANCE Rabies virus relies on cellular machinery for its replication while simultaneously evading the host immune response. Despite their importance, little is known about the key host factors required for rabies virus infection. Here, we focused on the human kinome, at the core of many cellular pathways, to unveil a new understanding of the rabies virus infectious cycle and to discover new potential therapeutic targets in a small interfering RNA screening. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and phosphatidylinositol metabolism were identified as prominent factors involved in rabies virus infection, and those findings were further confirmed in human neurons. While bringing a new insight into rabies virus biology, we also provide a new list of host factors involved in rabies virus infection.

In our empirical study, we find that European countries overall flatten the curves more effectively compared to the other regions, while Asia & Oceania also achieve some success, but the situations are not as optimistic elsewhere. Africa and America are still facing serious challenges in terms of managing the spread of the virus, and reducing the death rate, although in Africa the virus spreads slower and has a lower death rate than the other regions. By comparing the performances of different countries, our results incidentally agree with Gu et al. (2020) , though different approaches and models are considered. For example, both works agree that countries such as USA, UK and Italy perform relatively poorly; on the other hand, and Singapore perform relatively better.

Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed by the two section editors with the help of a medical librarian. The search through bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers was achieved using both MeSH headings and keywords in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of 15 candidate best papers was first selected by section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. Results: Over half of the 15 papers addressed the issue of data quality in the electronic health record (EHR). In addition to the focus on data quality, there were papers on other topics of long-standing interest to the field of HIM. These topics include privacy, security, and confidentiality of health information, comparability of different coding vocabularies, classifications and terminologies, and the HIM workforce. Finally, there were papers on newer topics for the HIM field, including mobile Health (mHealth), EHR use by public health departments, and usability of different strategies for displaying information in the EHR. Conclusions: Traditional HIM concerns about HIM practice and workforce as well as issues about data in the EHR including data quality, coding, and privacy and confidentiality continue to be a large part of the HIM research literature. However, newer topics which reflect innovative and emerging technologies, usability assessments, and the application of the EHR outside the traditional clinical setting are starting to appear and more research is needed on these newer areas.

a7e35b95fd9ae87cdde455093d564ccc1d3ede7b	Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the infectious agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 . Respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are well described, less defined is the clinical neurological spectrum of COVID-19. We reported a case of COVID-19 patient with acute monophasic Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and a literature review on the SARS-CoV-2 and GBS etiological correlation. Case Description A 68 years-old man presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute progressive symmetric ascending flaccid tetraparesis. Oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. Neurological examination showed bifacial nerve palsy and distal muscular weakness of lower limbs. The cerebrospinal fluid assessment showed an albuminocytologic dissociation. Electrophysiological studies showed delayed distal latencies and absent F waves in early course. A diagnosis of Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) subtype of GBS was then made. Conclusions Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are still under study. The case we described of GBS in COVID-19 patient adds to those already reported in the literature, in support of SARS-CoV-2 triggers GBS. COVID-19 associated neurological clinic should probably be seen not as a corollary of classic respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, but as SARS-CoV-2-related standalone clinical entities. To date, it is essential for all Specialists, clinicians and surgeons, to direct attention towards the study of this virus, to better clarify the spectrum of its neurological manifestations.

However, there is a paucity of data regarding long-term CT findings in survivors after SARS. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in lung function and lung thin-section computed tomography (CT) features in patients recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially the dynamic changes in ground-glass opacity (GGO). Clinical and radiological data from 11 patients with SARS were collected. The serial follow-up thin-section CTs were evaluated at 3, 6, and 84 months after SARS presentation. The distribution and predominant thin-section CT findings of lesions were evaluated. The extent of the lesions on the CT scans of the 11 patients decreased at 6 and 84 months compared to 3 months. The number of segments involved on 84-month follow-up CTs was less than those at 6 months (P<0.05). The predominant thin-section CT manifestation at 84 months (intralobular and interlobular septal thickening) was different than that at 6 months, at which GGO was predominant. During convalescence after SARS, GGO and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the main thinsection CT manifestation. Intralobular and interlobular septal thickening predominated over GGO at 84 months.

Windhager, et al., Second-to-fourth digit ratio and facial shape in Buryats of Southern Siberia, Early Human Development (2020), https://doi. Background. The 2 nd -to-4 th digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative predictor of a prenatal exposure to sex hormones. 2D:4D is sexually dimorphic (males < females). Studies, linking digit ratio and full facial shapes among Europeans, show that a low 2D:4D is associated with a set of malespecific facial features. Buryats -Mongolian people from Southern Siberiademonstrate a different pattern of facial sexual dimorphism than Europeans (narrower and more vertically elongated faces in men as opposed to women). Aim. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between facial shape and the 2D:4D in comparison to the pattern of facial sexual dimorphism in Buryats. Buryats: 88 men and 80 women aged 20 ± 2 years. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Outcome measures. To assess relationship between facial shape and 2D:4D we used a geometric morphometric approach based on standardized full-face frontal photographs and direct measurements of the digit lengths among right-handed individuals. Results. The results revealed that 2D:4D was associated with facial morphology in Buryat men, and to a lesser extent in women. Narrower faces, elongated in the vertical direction, and a narrower lower facial outline, were characteristic of Buryat men with low 2D:4D ratios, which corresponded to the male-like facial shapes in Buryats. In Europeans, such facial features were reported for men with high 2D:4D, which corresponded to female-like European facial shapes. Hence, our results show that sex-specific morphogenesis in humans is multidirectional, and that digit ratio is capable of predicting sexspecific facial traits even in populations with differing sexually-dimorphic morphology. During the last decades, the 2 nd -to-4 th digits ratio (2D:4D) has been extensively studied as a putative predictor of a prenatal exposure to sex hormonesin humans [1] [2] [3] [4] .Sexual dimorphism of digit ratios is found across a majority of vertebrates starting from amphibians [5,6], although it is not unidirectional in all species [7, 8] . For many human populations,the 2D:4Dhas been reported to be sexually dimorphic (with higher values in women) [9-13],which occursas early as at the 9 th week of gestation [14, 15] . The Leydig cells, which are responsible for production of testosterone (T), start functioning in human male fetusesfrom the 8 th week of gestation [16] , suggesting that an increase in T concentration during early prenatal development can be associated with sexspecific digit morphogenesis. Part of the mechanisms underlying an impact of prenatal androgen/estrogen exposure on the formation of differences in the 2 nd and 4 th digit lengths has Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f already been experimentally revealed in mice [17] . This, along with studies linking the development of digitsand gonads [18], and with androgen receptor sensitivity [19] , suggests 2D:4D to be a fine potential predictor of exposure to sex hormones in utero.The role of the 2D:4D as a marker is also supported by numerous studies reporting its association with sexspecific morphology and behaviour in humans [10, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] (although see [27] [28] [29] for criticism). Human facial morphology is also subjected to considerablesex differences, with menon average having more robust faces:a relatively lower forehead, an (at least slightly) higher facial width-toheight ratio (fWHR), and larger lower face [23, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .One of the reasons for this is also the exposure to gonadal hormones [23, 26, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Surprisingly, researchon the 2D:4D ratioin combination withfacial morphology are very rare. Few comprehensive studies, linkingdigit ratio and full facial shapesamong representatives of European populations [23, 26, 46] , have demonstrated that a low 2D:4D (a typically male trait)shows association with a set of population-specific male facial features, but with an admixture of some other, unrelated to chromosomal sex, patterns [23] .The associationbetween 2D:4D and facial shapewas alsoreported to be especially pronounced in men [23] .Another study, also focusing on a full-facial shape analysis among Europeans, has revealed that male-specific facial traits occur in boys even prior to puberty, and arenegatively associated with the 2D:4D ratio [25]. Sex-specific facial morphology may be subjected to population differences. A number of studies provide evidence that, leastways, such differences occur between Europeanand Asian populations.Primary differencesare located in such facial areas as the lower face, which in Europeans tend to demonstrate higher widths in men, and in Asiansin women [23, 32, 35, [37] [38] [47] [48] , nose, and lip shapes [38, 47, 49] . Therefore, it is ofa special interest to explore whether the association between 2D:4D and facial morphology in different populationscorresponds to the observed variation in facial sexual dimorphism. Udethe capital of Buryatia. All of them (with two exceptions) were students of different specialities (natural and social sciences, engineering, and arts) represented in approximately equal proportions. The body mass index of the participants was within the normal range (men: 22.06 ± 2.66 kg/m 2 ; women: 21.50 ± 2.48 kg/m 2 ; [53, 54] ). (b) Association between facial shape and 2D:4D in men and (c) in women. The average face here is deformed towards ± 5 standard deviations of 2D:4D from that mean. According to the deformation grids displayed in Fig.1b ,low 2D:4D(which presumably indicates a high level of prenatal androgenization) in menwas associated with male-relatedfacial features ( Fig. 1a) , such as a relatively narrower face with larger general height in the vertical plane, a Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f relatively narrower lower face (in the area of the bigonial breadth), and narrower eyesfissures.At the same time high 2D:4D(low prenatal androgenization) in men was associated with some characteristics typical of women in that population.However, not all of the sexspecificmorphometric traitscorresponded to the variation in facial shape explained by the 2D:4D ratio in men. Namely, such parameters are thedistance between the eyes and eyebrows as well as relativeforehead height, which aredistinctive features for menand women, but remained unaffected or demonstrated a reverse patternwhen seen as a function of 2D:4D ratios. Thus, the main differences associated with 2D:4Dare locatedin the mid-and lower part of the male face (in the craniofacial segment), whereas the area of the frontal bone (including forehead and the eyebrow region) did not show differencesin expected direction.In women with higher 2D:4D ratios, the relatively wider spacing of eyebrows and eyes reflect the female pattern, whereas the relatively more massive chin region and lower hairline do not fit the other patterns. The diminutiveness of shape changes even if presented for ±5 SD supports the comparably weak relationship between 2D:4D and facial shape in women. Our study demonstratedthat2D:4D ratio, as a putative proxy for prenatal androgen exposure,isassociated withmale facial morphology, which has also been previously reported forother populations [23, 25, 26, 46] . However, a comparison of our results with the results of thesestudiesshows that the pattern of facial sexual dimorphism, and accordingly the shape pattern of the association with 2D:4D differs between populations.Generally narrower faces, elongated in the vertical direction, and particularly a narrower lower facial outline, were characteristic of men (and boys) of European origin with high 2D:4D ratios. This in turn at least partly corresponded to thefemale-likefacial shapes in thatpopulation (Europeans). At the same time,low 2D:4D ratios in those studies were characteristic of men with relatively wider faces(especially in Journal Pre-proof Psychoneuroendocrinology 32(4) (2007) 313-321. https://doi.org/1016/j.psyneuen.2007.01.007.

Three different word lexicons were used and one of the outcomes of this research is the generation of a secondary dataset with more than 3658 records which can be used for other data analysis and data mining research. We used our secondary dataset to find and display correlations between different emotions on the videos and the correlation between emotions on the movies and users' scores on IMDb using the Pearson correlation method and found some statistically significant correlations.
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	The COVID-19 pandemic currently underway has overturned every personal, family, and work habit, generating new dynamics from the actual state of need whose consequences will be assessed over time. It is evident that remote work reduces distractions and maximizes the pro capite outcome of the single worker; however, the individual who spends his/her time in a stimulating environment, exchanging ideas and knowledge, increases not only his own creativity and inventiveness but even also those of the group he works with. In the Anglo-Saxon culture, the term "water cooler talk" or "water cooler conversation" is what happens when colleagues take a break from work-related tasks and discuss their hobbies, interests, and personal issues. Great ideas have always arisen thanks to interpersonal exchanges. It is not possible to replace the disruptive effect of contact and physical interaction between researchers, teachers, and students as it happens in a university context. Emmanuel Kant underlined the way individuals are pushed towards society by different and opposite tendencies, he speaks of "unsociable sociability" [1] as one of the most powerful factors of historical development and progress, because it stimulates people to develop their skills. However, it must be governed by rules that ensure its functioning: only through the regulation given by "external laws" the antagonism of individuals can be realized in such a way everyone's freedom can coexist with the freedom of all the others. In the medical-surgical field in general and especially in plastic surgery, the pandemic has generated the flowering of countless webinars sponsored by the national or international medical scientific societies when not organized by doctors considered points of reference for special topics as an alternative to the conferences that have necessarily been postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic effect. These circumstances have allowed the state of the art updating but in the meantime, it has generated at least two critical issues whose impact will have to be followed over time [2] . The first critical issue is technical: the Internet guarantees immediate access to great number of information in an attempt to universalize knowledge, but who checks and certifies the correctness of the information given by the faculties of the webinar? Moreover, who is able to verify how these new pieces of information are learnt? What's the impact on personal surgical activity? In fact, it is quite different to participate in the live conferences where close contact with tutors and mentors is provided, instead of listening to a webinar. The second important point is the so-called human-factor (this term is borrowed from the well-known growth factors in the biological field): medical knowledge has always benefited from the union of different thinking heads. In fact, many terms, entered into the daily practice as "brain storming" and "open space," generate the idea of a synergetic effect where inventiveness is enhanced through the physical contact, thanks to unexpected stimuli and contributions. Solo learning has been a fallback for this pandemic period but will never replace the role of the social impact on the knowledge progress. The process of acquiring knowledge is not only the result of a sum of notions, but it grows through the relationships between the new concepts acquired and the experience completed and enriched by the interaction with other people. "In life, a person can take one of two attitudes: to build or to plant. The builders might take years over their tasks, but one day, they finish what they're doing. Then they find that they're hemmed in by their own walls. Life loses its meaning when the building stops. Then there are those who plant.

It is still in its infancy; however, largely descriptive, and looking for the main drivers of particular phenomena, such as vaccination effects or pregnancy. But this lays the ground work for an increasingly sophisticated appreciation of subsystems and interactions and will lead to predictive modeling and a deeper understanding of human diseases and interactions with pathogens.
cd7128bccaa8c9ac0f98da48d995ecff46ca4137	Behavior diffusion through social networks is a key social process. It may be guided by various factors such as network topology, type of propagated behavior, and the strength of network connections. In this paper, we claim that the type of social interactions is also an important ingredient of behavioral diffusion. We examine the spread of academic achievements of first-year undergraduate students through friendship and study assistance networks, applying stochastic actor-oriented modeling. We show that informal social connections transmit performance while instrumental connections do not. The results highlight the importance of friendship in educational environments and contribute to debates on the behavior spread in social networks.

Very little is known about the infection mechanism for this virus. More importantly, there are no drugs or vaccines that can cure or prevent a person from getting COVID-19. In this study, the binding affinity of 2692 protease inhibitor compounds that are known in the protein data bank, are calculated against the main protease of the novel coronavirus with docking and molecular dynamics (MD). Both the docking and MD methods predict the macrocyclic tissue factor-factor VIIa (PubChem ID: 118098670) inhibitor to bind strongly with the main protease with a binding affinity of À10.6 and À10.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The TF-FVIIa inhibitors are known to prevent the coagulation of blood and have antiviral activity as shown in the case of SARS coronavirus. Two more inhibitors, phenyltriazolinones (PubChem ID: 104161460) and allosteric HCV NS5B polymerase thumb pocket 2 (PubChem ID: 163632044) have shown antiviral activity and also have high affinity towards the main protease of COVID-19. Furthermore, these inhibitors interact with the catalytic dyad in the active site of the COVID-19 main protease that is especially important in viral replication. The calculated theoretical dissociation constants of the proposed COVID-19 inhibitors are found to be very similar to the experimental dissociation constant values of similar protease-inhibitor systems.

398d903896858b2aecf8c6deb470847d702b2138	Cancer is a disease associated with aging. As the US population ages, the number of older adults with cancer is projected to dramatically increase. Despite this, older adults remain vastly underrepresented in research that sets the standards for cancer treatments and, consequently, clinicians struggle with how to interpret data from clinical trials and apply them to older adults in practice. A combination of system, clinician, and patient barriers bar opportunities for trial participation for many older patients, and strategies are needed to address these barriers at multiple fronts, five of which are offered here. This review highlights the need to (1) broaden eligibility criteria, (2) measure relevant end points, (3) expand standard trial designs, (4) increase resources (e.g., institutional support, interdisciplinary care, and telehealth), and (5) develop targeted interventions (e.g., behavioral interventions to promote patient enrollment). Implementing these solutions requires a substantial investment in engaging and collaborating with community-based practices, where the majority of older patients with cancer receive their care. Multifaceted strategies are needed to ensure that older patients with cancer, across diverse healthcare settings, receive the highest-quality, evidence-based care. literature documenting barriers to the accrual of older adults to cancer clinical trials (Figure 1) , there are few evidence-based strategies to mitigate these barriers [11, 12] . A recent systematic review revealed that among 8691 studies screened, only 12 relevant observational studies examined barriers hindering the participation of older adults in cancer clinical trials, and one (negative) randomized controlled trial evaluated an intervention to increase the enrollment of older adults in trials [8]. Moreover, few studies have focused on understanding the complex and multifactorial influences affecting the clinical trial participation of older patients with cancer in the community, where the majority of this population is often treated [13, 14] .

Limited information is available on comparative evaluation of IgG immunoassays against a clinical reference standard, i.e., RT-PCR positivity with >20 days of illness. This study addresses the need for comparing clinical performance of IgG immunoassays with respect to this alternate reference standard. Methods: We compared the performance of three immunoassays, an in-house RBD assay, and two commercial assays, the Diasorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S1 IgG CLIA which detects antibodies against S1/S2 domains of the Spike protein and the Zydus Kavach assay based on inactivated virus using a well-characterized panel of sera. 379 sera and plasma samples from RTPCR positive individuals >20 days of illness in symptomatic or RT-PCR positivity in asymptomatic individuals and 184 samples collected prior to 2019 were used for assay evaluation. Results: The sensitivity of the assays were 84.7 (95%CI 80.6 -88.1), 82.6 (95%CI 78.3 -86.2) and 75.7 (95%CI 71.0 -79.9) respectively for RBD, LIAISON and Kavach. Kavach and the in-house RBD ELISA showed a specificity of 99.5% and 100%, respectively. The RBD and LIAISON (S1/S2) assays showed high agreement (94.7%; 95%CI: 92.0, 96.6) and were able to correctly identify more positive sera/plasma than Kavach. Conclusion: Independent comparisons support the evaluation of performance characteristics of immunoassays. All three assays are suitable for serosurveillance studies, but in low prevalence sites, estimation of exposure may require adjustment based on our findings.
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impacts of infectious diseases including Avian Flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (hereafter SARS) on international tourist arrivals in Asian countries using both single datasets and panel data procedures. An autoregressive moving average model together with an exogenous variables (ARMAX) model are used to estimate the effects of these diseases in each SARS-and Avian Flu-infected country, while a dynamic panel model is adopted to estimate the overall impact on the region of these two diseases. The empirical results from both approaches are consistent and indicate that the numbers of affected cases have a significant impact on SARS-affected countries but not on Avian Flu-affected countries. However, since the potential damage arising from the Avian Flu and subsequent pandemic influenza is much greater than that resulting from the SARS, the need to take the necessary precautions in the event of an outbreak of Avian Flu and pandemic influenza warrants further attention and action. Therefore, the empirical findings of this study could add to the knowledge regarding the relationship between tourism and crisis management, especially in so far as the management of transmissible diseases is concerned. r

Within the small intestinal epithelium, adult stem cells integrate diverse signals to regulate regeneration and differentiation, thereby establishing overall cellularity. Accordingly, directing stem cell differentiation could provide a tractable approach to alter the abundance or quality of specialized cells of the small intestinal epithelium, including the secretory Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine populations. Yet, to date, there has been a lack of suitable tools and rigorous approaches to identify biological targets and pharmacological agents that can modify epithelial composition to enable causal testing of disease-associated changes with novel therapeutic candidates. To empower the search for epithelia-modifying agents, we establish a first-of-its-kind high-throughput phenotypic organoid screen. We demonstrate the ability to screen thousands of samples and uncover biological targets and associated small molecule inhibitors which translate to in vivo. This approach is enabled by employing a functional, cell-type specific, scalable assay on an organoid model designed to represent the physiological cues of in vivo Paneth cell differentiation from adult intestinal stem cells. Further, we miniaturize and adapt the organoid culture system to enable automated plating and screening, thereby providing the ability to test thousands of samples. Strikingly, in our screen we identify inhibitors of the nuclear exporter Xpo1 modulate stem cell fate commitment by inducing a panepithelial stress response combined with an interruption of mitogen signaling in cycling intestinal progenitors, thereby significantly increasing the abundance of Paneth cells independent of known WNT and Notch differentiation cues. We extend our observation in vivo, demonstrating that oral administration of Xpo1 inhibitor KPT-330 at doses 1,000fold lower than conventionally used in hematologic malignancies increases Paneth cell abundance. In total, we provide a framework to identify novel biological cues and therapeutic leads to rebalance intestinal stem cell differentiation and modulate epithelial tissue composition via high-throughput phenotypic screening in rationally-designed organoid model of differentiation.
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	Value theory forms the bedrock of several economic paradigms. It shapes how economists think about the purpose and functioning of the system as a whole. I identify three approaches to understanding value in economics: the British classical approach, exemplified by Smith and Ricardo, the neoclassical approach based on marginal utility theory, and Marxian value theory. The classical and neoclassical tradition explain exchange value by transhistorical use values. This gives rise to a conception of capitalism as a 'real economy', i.e. a system that produces goods and services for the purpose of satisfying people's needs and wants. Ecological economists adopt and extend the classical and neoclassical view, by predominantly studying a 'real real' economy, i.e. matter-energy stocks and flows and ultimate social outcomes. This allows an ecological critique of the economic process but fails to address underlying social drivers of ecological destruction. Marxian value theory provides a systemic (macro) understanding of value, which results in a realistic conception of capitalism as a monetary market economy. Marx's approach is the only value theory in economics that provides a fundamental critique of capitalism. I advocate a stronger integration of radical political economy and ecological economics to support social change.

We reformulate this problem as the transformation of an ordinary, one-safe Petri net into a flat, unit-safe NUPN (Nested-Unit Petri Net) and define a quality criterion based on the number of bits required for the structural encoding of markings. We propose various transformation methods, all of which we implemented in a tool chain that combines NUPN tools with third-party software, such as SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and tools for graph colouring and finding maximal cliques. We perform an extensive evaluation of these methods on a collection of more than 12,000 nets from diverse sources, including nets whose marking graph is too large for being explored exhaustively.

Coronavirus nucleoprotein (N) plays a structural role in virus assembly and has also been shown to be important in RNA synthesis. 4 In addition, template switching, an obligatory step in CoV transcription, needs to overcome an energy threshold. Therefore, we asked whether RNA chaperones are involved in transcription and, most importantly, if N is an RNA chaperone. RNA chaperones are proteins that bind RNA with broad specificity and that rescue RNAs trapped in unproductive folding states. 5-8 One of their main characteristics is that, once the RNA has been folded, they are no longer needed and, therefore, they can be removed without altering RNA conformation. There are three RNA chaperone activities easily evaluable in vitro: (i) enhancement of RNA ribozyme cleavage, (ii) rapid and accurate RNA-RNA annealing, and (iii) facilitation of RNA strand transfer and exchange. RNA chaperones decrease the activation energy required for a transition between transcription could be interpreted as a transition between two states: in the first one, a duplex between the nascent minus RNA strand and the genomic positive RNA used as template is formed; in the second one, the nascent RNA strand is paired with the TRS of the leader. Therefore, RNA chaperones could be involved in template switch by decreasing the energy required for the transition from the first to the second duplex (Fig. 1) . The last step in the current model of coronavirus transcription is a template switch
7e97f0e86c26dcb300aa58e766c14eec990e2584	Background: Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, public health interventions have been introduced globally in order to prevent the spread of the virus and avoid the overload of health care systems, especially for the most severely affected patients. Scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients, identifying treatment options and developing vaccines. In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Nonetheless, these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and hence to appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to develop a better understanding of the state and dynamics of the pandemic. Methods: In 100 out of 755 randomly selected constituencies, 3000 Munich households are identified via random route and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and subjects ≥14 years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of ≤3 ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children < 14 years, are offered a pharyngeal swab taken at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. In case of severe symptoms, participants will be transferred to a Munich hospital. For one year, the study teams re-visits the households for blood sampling every six weeks. (Continued on next page)
44b6eea3629b4e13595dc49813ee39a0d20dc5f2	The process of molecular adaptation following a cross-species virus transmission event is 9 currently poorly understood. Here, we identified 137 protein sites that experienced deceleration 10 in their rate of evolution along the HIV-1/SIV phylogeny, likely indicating gain-of-function and 11 consequent adaptation. The majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross-species 12 transmission events and varied between HIV-1 groups, indicating independent adaptation 13 strategies. The evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in 14 accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors, suggesting that these factors 15 are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host. Surprisingly, we observed that the non-16 pandemic HIV-1 group O, derived from gorillas, exhibited more rate deceleration events than 17 the pandemic group M, derived from chimpanzees. We suggest that the species barrier is higher 18 when the genetic distance of the hosts increases. Our approach paves the way for subsequent 19 studies on cross-species transfers in other major pathogens.
e7da5beab19d17e7d2bdd3c2de656447ebe4f20d	Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has recently been recognized as an important respiratory pathogen, especially in children. At present, our understanding of the characteristics of hMPV from China is very limited. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from 310 hospitalized pediatric patients. Twenty (6.5%) of them were infected with hMPV, and they all developed pneumonia. Sixty five percent (13/20) of the cases were under 12 months. Phylogenetic analysis of F gene fragments indicated that three sub-genotypes of hMPV(A2a/A2b, B1,B2) circulated in Tianjin and A2b was the predominant subtype. The Vero-E6 cell line was better than LLC-MK2 for hMPV isolation. Three hMPV strains were successfully isolated using the Vero-E6 cell line.
022f8ae85f37083c83b0a3991769a443d80bd7dd	Nowadays, remote healthcare monitoring systems (RHMS) are attracting patients, doctors and caregivers. RHMS reduces the number of unessential hospitalizations by providing the required healthcare services for patients at home. Furthermore, continuous health monitoring using RHMS is a hopeful solution for elderly people suffering from chronic diseases. RHMS is in general three tiers architecture where the first tier uses intelligent wearable sensors to gather physiological signs. The majority of wearable sensors constructors commercialized sensing devices with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication interfaces, which lead to the development of diverse RHMS deploying BLE communication interfaces for physiological patient data gathering. In this paper, we introduce the basic concepts related to RHMS design and development. Besides that, we focus our investigation on the BLE communication protocol used in the healthcare context and its configuration to sense several physiological data. Also, we highlight the different steps enabling reading sensed data on mobile application.
a66586127f4a105222ef82e28aaffb997ef1fd80	Carbocyclic nucleosides (−)-5′-homocarbovir and (+)-epi-4′-homocarbovir were prepared from an acylnitroso-derived hetero Diels-Alder cycloadduct. A kinetic enzymatic resolution generated an enantiopure aminocyclopentenol and Pd(0)-mediated decarboxylative allylations of allyl 2,2,2trifluoroethyl malonates were used to install the 4′-hydroxyethyl groups. Late stage derivatization gave access to the cyclopropylamine congenors, (−)-5′-homoabacavir and (+)-epi-4′homoabacavir. All carbonucleoside target molecules were evaluated for antiviral activity.

Comparisons of the structural polypeptides of 12 IBV isolates, consisting of M41, six serologically related viruses and representatives of five other serotypes, showed that the viruses could be placed in three groups on the molecular weights of the major glycopolypeptides. These were 31,000 and 86,000 for M41, the six related viruses and the serologically distinct SE 17; 27,000 and 89,000 for Iowa 97 and Ho]te and 27,000 and 91,000 for Connecticut and T strain.
fa28c65c049398eba8e4713618c6a24fa282748c	Our study gives a comprehensive picture of the evolution of all-cause mortality in Italy from 2016 to 2020 and describes the spatio-temporal differences in the excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. We showed a heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 pandemic across Italy, which should help policy makers when adopting control measures that affect the health-care system as well as having social and economic consequences. Additionally, the probabilistic methodology that we proposed is useful for real-time mortality surveillance, continuously monitoring local temporal trends and flagging where and when the mortality rates deviate from the expected range, suggesting a second wave of the pandemic, therefore requiring a timely intervention.

cdd82befa24c7c2e2a676a8f7cf364e87ff4cd7a	Results from a study of 238 coeliotomy-assisted intrauterine inseminations (CAII), performed at a specialist hospital, suggest that this technique can produce similar whelping rates to non-surgical or intravaginal insemination. 1 CAII is a relative simple artificial insemination technique that does not require specialised equipment or training. However, there is little published data on its clinical effectiveness, despite its apparent widespread use. This retrospective, single cohort, observational study reports the clinical outcomes of commercially performed CAII and the factors that affect its outcomes. In total, 174 CAIIs resulted in whelping and the authors conclude that good quality sperm is important for success. Whelping rates with CAII are not maximised unless more than 200 ¥ 10 6 progressively motile sperm are inseminated. bs_bs_banner EDITORIAL EDITORIAL
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	Uncertainties remain concerning the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Among unsettled controversies is whether tobacco smoking increases or protects from severe COVID-19. Several epidemiological studies reported reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations among smokers, while other studies reported the opposite trend. Some authors assumed that smokers have elevated airway expression of ACE2, the cell recognition site of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, but this suggestion remains unverified. We therefore performed data mining of two independent NCBI GEO genome-wide RNA expression files (GSE7894 and GSE994) and report that in both data sets, current smokers and never smokers have, on average, closely similar bronchial epithelial cell mRNA levels of ACE2, as well as TMPRSS2, coding for a serine protease priming SARS-Cov-2 for cell entry, and ADAM17, coding for a protease implicated in ACE2 membrane shedding. In contrast, the expression levels of TMPRSS4, coding for a protease that primes SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry similarly to TMPRSS2, were elevated in bronchial epithelial cells from current smokers compared with never smokers, suggesting that higher bronchial TMPRSS4 levels in smokers might put them at higher SARS-Cov-2 infection risk. The effects of smoking on COVID-19 severity need clarification with larger studies. Additionally, the postulated protective effects of nicotine and nitric oxide, which may presumably reduce the risk of a "cytokine storm" in infected individuals, deserve assessment by controlled clinical trials. ACE2, nicotine, nitric oxide, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4
1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554	Background: A novel human enterovirus (HEV) type within the species HEV-C, named EV109, was discovered from cases of respiratory illness in Nicaragua in September 2010. The aim of this study, was to retrospectively examine the presence and the role of EV109 in respiratory samples from two patients populations; infants below the age of 2 years, hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. Results: A total of 1149 nasopharingeal aspirates were collected and tested for the presence of EV109 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). In positive samples, the presence of the most common respiratory viruses was also assayed and clinical symptoms were evaluated. Samples from 2 of the 974 infants tested positive for EV109 RNA (0.2%) and belonged to patients with lower ARDs; co-infection with other viral pathogens under study was observed in both cases. In transplant recipients, one out of the 175 samples analyzed, from a patients with upper respiratory simptoms tested positive for HEV 109 in the absence of co-infecting viruses. Sequence analysis of amplified EV109 genomic regions, showed only a few nucleotide differences when compared with the Nicaraguan strains. Conclusions: Overall these results indicate that HEV109 variants have circulated and differentiated in different lineages worldwide. Although more cases and larger studies are needed, HEV109 infection may be associated to ARDs both in infants and in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. If these preliminary observations will be confirmed, improved molecular methods with a wider panel of potential pathogens will be useful for monitoring these categories of patients.
cd56ccc3526c0f5856c98b36f694f45f5c74c19f	Human-to-human transmission of influenza viruses is a serious public health threat, yet the precise role of immunity from previous infections on the susceptibility to airborne viruses is still unknown. Using human seasonal influenza viruses in a ferret model, we examined the roles of exposure duration and heterosubtypic immunity on influenza transmission. We found that airborne transmission of seasonal influenza strains is abrogated in recipient animals with pre-existing nonneutralizing immunity, indicating that transmissibility of a given influenza virus strain should be examined in the context of ferrets that are not immunologically naïve.
d1ff5b3f3f46093b23efa3c3f1f89dc39fd47720	Viral proteins evade host immune function by molecular mimicry, often achieved by short linear motifs (SLiMs) of three to ten consecutive amino acids (AAs). Motif mimicry tolerates mutations, evolves quickly to modify interactions with the host, and enables modular interactions with protein complexes. Host cells cannot easily coordinate changes to conserved motif recognition and binding interfaces under selective pressure to maintain critical signaling pathways. SLiMs offer potential for use in synthetic biology, such as better immunogens and therapies, but may also present biosecurity challenges. We survey viral uses of SLiMs to mimic host proteins, and information resources available for motif discovery. As the number of examples continues to grow, knowledge management tools are essential to help organize and compare new findings.
d14d114d813c5a5508db1b81da6471ca3401cdca	Graphical abstract J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights  Pudilan (PDL) was proven to be useful in the treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  Pudilan (PDL) might inhibit the cytokine storm in 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by affecting Interleukin-1β (IL-1β ) and related proteins.  Pudilan (PDL) might prevent the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells by affecting angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).  Pudilan (PDL) might also moderate human immune system with traditional Chinese medicine theory. Background Pudilan (PDL), a four-herb prescription with the traditional function of heat-clearing and detoxifying, has been clinically used as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 infectory agent in China for decades. PDL might also have therapeutic potentials for COVID-19 while the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. We used network pharmacology analysis and selected 68 co-targeted genes/proteins as targets of both PDL and COVID-19. These co-targeted genes/proteins were predicted by SwissDock Server for their high-precision docking simulation, and analyzed by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f STRING for proteins to protein interaction (PPI), pathway and GO (gene ontology) enrichment. The therapeutic effect for PDL treatment on COVID-19 was validated by the TCMATCOV (TCM Anti COVID-19) platform.
b87dbfb99e667d88cda4e153340b44404f7b4c98	Background: After the WHO issued the global alert for 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), many national health agencies began to screen travelers on entry in airports, ports and border crossings to try to delay local transmission. Methods: We reviewed entry screening policies adopted by different nations and ascertained dates of official report of the first laboratory-confirmed imported H1N1 case and the first laboratory-confirmed untraceable or 'local' H1N1 case. Results: Implementation of entry screening policies was associated with on average additional 7-12 day delays in local transmission compared to nations that did not implement entry screening, with lower bounds of 95% confidence intervals consistent with no additional delays and upper bounds extending to 20-30 day additional delays. Conclusions: Entry screening may lead to short-term delays in local transmission of a novel strain of influenza virus. The resources required for implementation should be balanced against the expected benefits of entry screening.
9a6c27dfb687bd031dad4a38710bba0534e58c27	Purpose: Coronavirus disease 2019 is creating an unprecedented healthcare crisis. Understanding the determinants of mortality is crucial to optimise intensive care unit (ICU) resource use and to identify targets for improving survival. In a multicentre retrospective study, we included 379 COVID-19 patients admitted to four ICUs between 20 February and 24 April 2020 and categorised according to time from disease onset to ICU admission. A Cox proportional-hazards model identified factors associated with 28-day mortality. Results: Median age was 66 years (53-68) and 292 (77%) were men. The main comorbidities included obesity and overweight (67%), hypertension (49.6%) and diabetes (30.1%). Median time from disease onset (i.e., viral symptoms) to ICU admission was 8 (6-11) days (missing for three); 161 (42.5%) patients were admitted within a week of disease onset, 173 (45.6%) between 8 and 14 days, and 42 (11.1%) > 14 days after disease onset; day 28 mortality was 26.4% (22-31) and decreased as time from disease onset to ICU admission increased, from 37 to 21% and 12%, respectively. Patients admitted within the first week had higher SOFA scores, more often had thrombocytopenia or acute kidney injury, had more limited radiographic involvement, and had significantly higher blood IL-6 levels. Age, COPD, immunocompromised status, time from disease onset, troponin concentration, and acute kidney injury were independently associated with mortality. The excess mortality in patients admitted within a week of disease onset reflected greater non-respiratory severity. Therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 might impact different clinical endpoints according to time since disease onset.
ba23ef78f7b162ec4ec37741a73e9984b6b63c94	Replication of avian infectious bronchitis virus in permissive BHK-21 cells is blocked when these cells are enucleated or irradiated with ultraviolet light prior to infection, or if cells sre treated with a-amanitin during the virus growth cycle. This coronavirus, like influenza virus, can replicate normally in the presence of cr-amanitin in Chinese hamster ovary cells which possess a drug-resistant RNA polymerase II. These findings indicate that avian infectious bronchitis virus requires the intact cell nucleus and one or more host transcriptional functions for productive infections, Preliminary data suggest that these cellular functions involve some aspect of virus-directed RNA synthesis.
8e1eaa3b676ca8163c72106b913606f6aeccfc48	Films illustrate 2 ways that epidemics can affect societies: fear leading to a breakdown in sociability and fear stimulating preservation of tightly held social norms. The first response is often informed by concern over perceived moral failings within society, the second response by the application of arbitrary or excessive controls from outside the community.
94f51ff48ecab31eb34912aca2d4c0e99dc74182	A rapid antiviral immune response may be related to viral interaction with the host cell leading to activation of macrophages via pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) or specific viral receptors. Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) is the specific receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus known to induce acute viral hepatitis in mice. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms responsible for the secretion of high-pathogenic MHV3-induced inflammatory cytokines. We report that the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a in peritoneal macrophages does not depend on CEACAM1a, as demonstrated in cells isolated from Ceacam1a )/) mice. The induction of IL-6 and TNF-a production was related rather to the fixation of the spike (S) protein of MHV3 on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in regions enriched in heparan sulphate and did not rely on viral replication, as demonstrated with denatured S protein and UVinactivated virus. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-a were produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice but not in livers from Tlr2 )/) mice. The histopathological observations were correlated with the levels of those inflammatory cytokines. Depending on mouse strain, the viral fixation to heparan sulfate/TLR2 stimulated differently the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-jB in the induction of IL-6 and TNF-a. These results suggest that TLR2 and heparan sulphate receptors can act as new viral PPRs involved in inflammatory responses.

c7e51348da71b6097b982610c3dadb9154e4651c	Bats are known reservoirs for numerous emerging infectious diseases, occupy unique ecological niches, and occur globally except for Antarctica. Given their impact on human and agricultural health, it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying immunocompetence in this reservoir host. To date, few studies have examined immune function in the Order Chiroptera, particularly among natural colonies of bats. The phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test has been widely used to measure delayed-type cellular immune response in a wide variety of vertebrates, and has been routinely employed in immunoecological studies. Although this test is frequently described as a measure of T cell proliferation, recent studies indicate it may represent a combination of immune responses. In mammals, the immune response is differentially, temporally and spatially regulated, therefore, we characterized the infiltrating leukocyte response to the PHA skin test in bats by examining a time-series of histological sections from PHA and saline injection areas in 41 Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). Results suggest that bats exhibit diverse leukocyte traffic within 6 h, and up to 24 h following subcutaneous PHA injection. There was a significant presence of lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages observed in the PHA-injected tissues, compared with saline-injected control tissues. We observed a highly significant negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils in PHA-injected tissue, with peak lymphocyte response at 12 h, and peak neutrophil response at 24 h post-injection. These results indicate substantial variation in the immune response of individuals, and may aid our understanding of disease emergence in natural populations of bats.
30c4e8dbd71c1d2d71db5f520df57107797ff455	Epidemiological studies of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and animal model data support the hypothesis that viruses initiate the immunopathogenic events leading to demyelination in MS. There have been no reports, however, of consistent detection of viruses in MS central nervous system tissue. We probed MS and control brain with cDNA probes specific for human, murine, porcine, and bovine coronaviruses. We report the in situ hybridization detection of coronavirus RNA in 12 of 22 MS brain samples using cloned coronavirus cDNA probes. In addition, tissue was screened for coronavirus antigen by immunohistochemical methods; antigen was detected in two patients with rapidly progressive MS. Significant amounts of coronavirus antigen and RNA were observed in active demyelinating plaques from these two patients. These findings show that coronaviruses can infect the human central nervous system and raise the possibility that these viruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of MS in some patients. sclerosis center, D~~~ 7 5 0 0~~, 501 E~~ Hapden A,,~, ~~~l wood, cO 801 CO; the tDepartment

09b2036eba6ba6a828fecc57c7ba7ff7ff7d9dcf	The data on the outcomes of solid organ transplant recipients who have contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still emerging. Kidney transplant recipients are commonly prescribed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (AAS) inhibitors given the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. As the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates the entry of coronaviruses into target cells, there have been hypotheses that preexisting use of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Given the common use of RAAS inhibitors among solid organ transplant recipients, we sought to review the RAAS cascade, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry, and pertinent data related to the effect of RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 to guide management of solid organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic. At present there is no clear evidence to support the discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
c8f9c5d7e30e601b4ea6e3c42696177c57aa1c47	Protein nuclear transport is an integral process to many cellular pathways and often plays a critical role during viral infection. To overcome the barrier presented by the nuclear membrane and gain access to the nucleus, virally encoded proteins have evolved ways to appropriate components of the nuclear transport machinery. By binding karyopherins, or the nuclear pore complex, viral proteins influence their own transport as well as the transport of key cellular regulatory proteins. This review covers how viral proteins can interact with different components of the nuclear import machinery and how this influences viral replicative cycles. We also highlight the effects that viral perturbation of nuclear transport has on the infected host and how we can exploit viruses as tools to study novel mechanisms of protein nuclear import. Finally, we discuss the possibility that drugs targeting these transport pathways could be repurposed for treating viral infections.
00623268d0ce12f11d6b3acb0cc012821f592b93	Coronavirus envelope (E) proteins are short ($100 residues) polypeptides that contain at least one transmembrane (TM) domain and a cluster of 2-3 juxtamembrane cysteines. These proteins are involved in viral morphogenesis and tropism, and their absence leads in some cases to aberrant virions, or to viral attenuation. In common to other viroporins, coronavirus envelope proteins increase membrane permeability to ions. Although an NMR-based model for the TM domain of the E protein in the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV E) has been reported, structural data and biophysical studies of full length E proteins are not available because efficient expression and purification methods for these proteins are lacking. Herein we have used a novel fusion protein consisting of a modified b-barrel to purify both wild type and cysteine-less mutants of two representatives of coronavirus E proteins: the shortest (76 residues), from SARS-CoV E, and one of the longest (109 residues), from the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV E). The fusion construct was subsequently cleaved with cyanogen bromide and all polypeptides were obtained with high purity. This is an approach that can be used in other difficult hydrophobic peptides.
69fa88ffea6e091803ed05debfc5f14578e36e9a	Chicken kidney (CK) cell cultures have historically proved useful for the assay of a number of viruses including coronaviruses. A technique for the preparation of such cell cultures, using a combination of manual and trypsin disaggregation of kidneys dissected from 2-to 3-week-old birds is described. This technique routinely gives high cell yield together with high viability and the resultant adherent primary cultures can be used for virus growth and plaque formation.
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	Background: Stepped-wedge designs (SWDs) are currently being used to investigate interventions to reduce opioid overdose deaths in communities located in several states. However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and social distancing orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the proposed intervention as they become widely available. These types of events induce confounding of the intervention effect by time. Such confounding is a well-known limitation of SWDs; a common approach to adjusting for it makes use of a mixed effects modeling framework that includes both fixed and random effects for time. However, these models have several shortcomings when multiple confounding factors are present. Methods: We discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce mortality associated with the opioid epidemic, and propose solutions to accommodate deviations from assumptions that underlie these models. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models under different sources of confounding. We specifically examine the impact of factors external to the study and premature adoption of intervention components. Results: When only external factors are present, our simulation studies show that commonly used mixed effects models can result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, but have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models are severely biased when confounding factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters; premature adoption of intervention components is an example of this scenario. In these scenarios, models that incorporate fixed intervention-by-time interaction terms and an unstructured covariance for the interventionby-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error, but may reduce power. Conclusions: The incorporation of fixed and random time effects in mixed effects models require certain assumptions about the impact of confounding by time in SWD. Violations of these assumptions can result in severe bias of the intervention effect estimate, under coverage of confidence intervals, and inflated Type 1 error. Since model choice has considerable impact on study power as well as validity of results, careful consideration needs to be given to choosing an appropriate model that takes into account potential confounding factors.
414521e701ed2e14e8bd5fa7a59a79cbf8add79d	Positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses (e.g. poliovirus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, SARS-coronavirus) remodel cellular membranes to form so-called viral replication compartments (VRCs), which are the sites where viral RNA genome replication takes place. To induce VRC formation, these viruses extensively rewire lipid metabolism. Disparate viruses have many commonalities as well as disparities in their interactions with the host lipidome and accumulate specific sets of lipids (sterols, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids) at their VRCs. Recent years have seen an upsurge in studies investigating the role of lipids in +RNA virus replication, in particular of sterols, and uncovered that membrane contact sites and lipid transfer proteins are hijacked by viruses and play pivotal roles in VRC formation.
eae636d786708e8b229d952affd28b9ea8321bc4	In calves, passive immunity of immunoglobulins can be acquired through ingestion of colostrum or colostrum replacers. Plasma can been used to supplement immunoglobulins in healthy or sick calves. Serum half-life of colostral derived immuglobulin G (IgG) is estimated to be 20 days. Half-life of IgG is important in determining response to antigens and timing of vaccination in calves. To date studies evaluating half-life of colostrum replacer or plasma derived IgG are lacking. The objectives of this study were to compare the serum halflife of IgG derived from colostrum, colostrum replacer and plasma in dairy calves reared up to 35 days of age. Thirty Jersey calves were randomly assigned to receive colostrum or colostrum replacer by oroesophageal tubing or plasma by intravenous administration. Serum samples were collected at 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days. Serum IgG concentrations were determined by radial immunodiffusion. The results indicated that half-life for IgG in colostrum fed (28.5 days) or plasma transfused calves (27.3 days) was longer than colostrum replacer fed calves (19.1 days). Further studies are required to evaluate pathogen specific immunoglobulins in order to recommend vaccination timing in calves fed colostrum replacers.
a7d1aa453c98881cc2669c24d623ae1365c22191	Background. Patients infected with influenza A(H7N9) virus present with acute lung injury (ALI) that is due to severe pneumonia and systemic inflammation. It is often fatal because there are few effective treatment options. Complement activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of virus-induced lung injury; therefore, we investigated the effect of targeted complement inhibition on ALI induced by H7N9 virus infection. Methods. A novel neutralizing specific antihuman C5a antibody (IFX-1) was used. This antibody blocked the ability of C5a to induce granulocytes to express CD11b while not affecting the ability of C5b to form the membrane attack complex. African green monkeys were inoculated with H7N9 virus and treated intravenously with IFX-1. Results. The virus infection led to intense ALI and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in association with excessive complement activation. Anti-C5a treatment in H7N9-infected monkeys substantially attenuated ALI: It markedly reduced the lung histopathological injury and decreased the lung infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. Moreover, the treatment decreased the intensity of SIRS; the body temperature changes were minimal and the plasma levels of inflammatory mediators were markedly reduced. The treatments also significantly decreased the virus titers in the infected lungs. Conclusions. Antihuman C5a antibody treatment remarkably reduced the ALI and systemic inflammation induced by H7N9 virus infection. Complement inhibition may be a promising adjunctive therapy for severe viral pneumonia.
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus and its rapid spread underlines the importance of understanding human mobility. Enclosed spaces, such as public transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide smart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different groups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination efforts.
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	This study empirically investigates the complex interplay between the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, mobility changes in retail and recreation, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas, and lockdown measures in 88 countries of the word. To conduct the study, data on mobility patterns, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people, lockdown measures, and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources (e.g., Google, UNDP, UN, BBC, Oxford University, Worldometer). A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic.
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	Background: Addition of high-dose cytarabine (HDCA) to the conventional cyclophosphamide/total-body irradiation (CY/TBI) regimen significantly improved prognosis after cord blood transplantation (CBT) for adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The efficacy of HDCA in bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (BMT/PBSCT), however, has not yet been elucidated. Findings: We conducted a cohort study to compare the prognosis of HDCA/CY/TBI (N = 435) and CY/TBI (N = 1667) in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS using a Japanese transplant registry database. The median age was 38 years, and 86.0 % of the patients had AML. Unrelated donors comprised 54.6 %, and 63.9 % of donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched. Overall survival (OS) was not improved in the HDCA/CY/TBI group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.14; p = 0.13). Neutrophil engraftment was inferior (HR, 0.80; p < 0.01), and the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis and thrombotic microangiopathy increased in HDCA/CY/TBI (HR, 1.47 and 1.60; p = 0.06 and 0.04, respectively), leading to significantly higher non-relapse mortality (NRM; HR, 1.48; p < 0.01). Post-transplant relapse and tumor-related mortality were not suppressed by the addition of HDCA. Conclusions: This study indicated the inefficacy of HDCA/CY/TBI in BMT/PBSCT for AML/MDS. Our results should be validated in large-scale prospective studies.

Specific RNA sequences and structural motifs can also enhance activation of OAS1 through currently undefined mechanisms. To better understand these drivers of OAS activation, we tested the impact of defined sequence changes within a short dsRNA that strongly activates OAS1. Both in vitro and in human A549 cells, appending a 3 -end single-stranded pyrimidine (3 -ssPy) can strongly enhance OAS1 activation or have no effect depending on its location, suggesting that other dsRNA features are necessary for correct presentation of the motif to OAS1. Consistent with this idea, we also find that the dsRNA binding position is dictated by an established consensus sequence (WWN 9 WG). Unexpectedly, however, not all sequences fitting this consensus activate OAS1 equivalently, with strong dependence on the identity of both partially conserved (W) and non-conserved (N 9 ) residues. A picture thus emerges in which both specific RNA features and the context in which they are presented dictate the ability of short dsRNAs to activate OAS1.

The COVID-19 pandemics required several changes in stroke management and it may have influenced some clinical or functional characteristics. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemics on stroke management during the first month of Italy lockdown. In addition, we described the emergency structured pathway adopted by an Italian University Hub Stroke Unit in the cross -border Italy-Slovenia area. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Methods. We analyzed admitted patients' clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019. Total admissions experienced a reduction of 45% during the lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (16 vs 29, respectively), as well as a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS>10) at admission (n=8, 50% vs n=8, 28%). A dramatic prevalence of stroke of unknown symp tom onset was observed in 2020 (n=8, 50% vs n=3, 10%). During lockdown, worse functional and independence outcomes were found, despite the similar proportion of reperfused patients. Similar 'symptoms alert-to-admission' and 'door-to-treatment' times were observed. During lockdown hospitalization was shorter and fewer patients completed the stroke work-up. In conclusion, the adopted strategies for stroke management during the COVID-19 emergency have suggested being effective, while suffering a reduced and delayed reporting of symptoms. Therefore, we recommend raising awareness among the population against possible stroke symptoms onset. Thus, think F.A.S.T. and do not stay-at-home at all costs.

a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems all over the world are struggling to manage the massive increase in emergency department (ED) visits. This has put an enormous demand on medical professionals. Increased wait times in the ED increases the risk of infection transmission. In this work we present an open-source, low cost, off-body system to assist in the automatic triage of patients in the ED based on widely available hardware. The system initially focuses on two symptoms of the infection -fever and cyanosis. The use of visible and far-infrared cameras allows for rapid assessment at a 1m distance, thus reducing the load on medical staff and lowering the risk of spreading the infection within hospitals. Its utility can be extended to a general clinical setting in non-emergency times as well to reduce wait time, channel the time and effort of healthcare professionals to more critical tasks and also prioritize severe cases. Our system consists of a Raspberry Pi 4, a Google Coral USB accelerator, a Raspberry Pi Camera v2 and a FLIR Lepton 3.5 Radiometry Long-Wave Infrared Camera with an associated IO module. Algorithms running in real-time detect the presence and body parts of individual(s) in view, and segments out the forehead and lip regions using PoseNet. The temperature of the forehead-eye area is estimated from the infrared camera image and cyanosis is assessed from the image of the lips in the visible spectrum. In our preliminary experiments, an accuracy of 97% was achieved for detecting fever and 77% for the detection of cyanosis, with a sensitivity of 91% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. Although preliminary results are promising, we note that the entire system needs to be optimized before use and assessed for efficacy. The use of low-cost instrumentation will not produce temperature readings and identification of cyanosis that is acceptable in many situations. For this reason, we are releasing the full code stack and system design to allow others to rapidly iterate and improve the system. This may be of particular benefit in low-resource settings, and low-to-middle income countries in particular, which are just beginning to be affected by COVID-19.
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	We replaced the HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) domain with different N-coding sequences to test SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) self-interaction capacity, and determined the capabilities of each chimera to direct viruslike particle (VLP) assembly. Analysis results indicate that the replacement of NC with the carboxyl-terminal half of the SARS-CoV N resulted in the production of wild type (wt)-level virus-like particles (VLPs) with the density of a wt HIV-1 particle. When co-expressed with SARS-CoV N, chimeras containing the N carboxyl-terminal half sequence efficiently packaged N. However, the same was not true for the chimera bearing the N amino-terminal half sequence, despite its production of substantial amounts of VLPs. According to further analysis, HIV-1 NC replacement with N residues 2-213, 215-421, or 234-421 resulted in efficient VLP production at levels comparable to that of wt HIV-1, but replacement with residues 215-359, 302-421, 2-168, or 2-86 failed to restore VLP production to wildtype levels. The results suggest that the domain conferring the ability to direct VLP assembly and release in SARS-CoV N is largely contained between residues 168 and 421.
3ebe9c3e3c98862d33e635bd0302513a2072c71a	Chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine are primarily known as antimalaria drugs. Here, we investigate the influence of hydration water on the molecular dynamics in hydroxychloroquine sulfate, a commonly used solubilized drug form. When hydration, even at a low level, results in a disordered structure, as opposed to the highly ordered structure of dry hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the activation barriers for the rotation of methyl groups in the drug molecules become randomized and, on average, significantly reduced. The facilitated stochastic motions of the methyl groups may benefit the biomolecular activity due to the more efficient sampling of the energy landscape in the disordered hydration environment experienced by the drug molecules in vivo.
3d502d3118bc79731c9d5a8e810d73ec382c19ad	COVID-19 epidemic has been suppressed in Hungary due to timely non-pharmaceutical interventions, prompting a huge reduction in the number of contacts and transmission of the virus. This strategy was effective in preventing epidemic growth and reducing the incidence of COVID-19 to low levels. In this report, we present the first epidemiological and statistical analysis of the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hungary. Then, we establish an age-structured compartmental model to explore alternative post-lockdown scenarios. We incorporate various factors, such as age-specific measures, seasonal effects, and spatial heterogeneity to project the possible peak size and disease burden of a COVID-19 epidemic wave after the current measures are relaxed.
cce28adf84a6833e1f16db79ba4409456d44c3cd	The COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread harm and disruption. Countries have implemented unprecedented measures to protect the lives and livelihoods of their inhabitants. The scope and composition of these responses are shaped, in part, by research and analysis about the estimated economic impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic and proposed responses to it. This analysis outlines basic features and principles involved in economic studies, specifically economic impact studies and economic evaluations, which have formed a significant part of the everincreasing evidence base about COVID-19. This analysis introduces economic studies in this context, highlighting what they can do, their limitations, and key steps involved in conducting them. It highlights examples of economic analysis focused on COVID-19 and on health emergencies and disasters more broadly. Knowing how economic studies are conducted, and their limitations, will help introduce how their findings can be a useful, usable, and used part of efforts to tackle this global health crisis.
a7c903a88894a0e40d3b9266d4004f782a48c60f	The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased food insecurity in the United States (US). The objective of this study was to understand the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income adults in the US as social distancing measures began to be implemented. On 19-24 March 2020 we fielded a national, web-based survey (53% response rate) among adults with <250% of the federal poverty line in the US (N = 1478). Measures included household food security status and COVID-19-related basic needs challenges. Overall, 36% of low-income adults in the US were food secure, 20% had marginal food security, and 44% were food insecure. Less than one in five (18.8%) of adults with very low food security reported being able to comply with public health recommendations to purchase two weeks of food at a time. For every basic needs challenge, food-insecure adults were significantly more likely to report facing that challenge, with a clear gradient effect based on severity of food security. The short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are magnifying existing disparities and disproportionately affecting low-income, food-insecure households that already struggle to meet basic needs. A robust, comprehensive policy response is needed to mitigate food insecurity as the pandemic progresses.
6a231615dfd547e25a9e727f29ab88a2b4869174	Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis), an important fishborne zoonotic parasite threatening public health, is of major socioeconomic importance in epidemic areas. Effective strategies are still urgently expected to prevent against C. sinensis infection. In the present study, paramyosin of C. sinensis (CsPmy) was stably and abundantly expressed on the surface of Bacillus subtilis spores. The recombinant spores (B.s-CotC-CsPmy) were incorporated in the basal pellets diet in three different dosages (1 × 10 5 , 1 × 10 8 , 1 × 10 11 CFU/g pellets) and orally administrated to grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). The immune responses and intestinal microbiota in the treated grass carp were investigated. Results showed that specific anti-CsPmy IgM levels in sera, skin mucus, bile, and intestinal mucus, as well as mRNA levels of IgM and IgZ in the spleen and head kidney, were significantly increased in B.s-CotC-CsPmy-10 11 group. Besides, transcripts levels of IL-8 and TNF-αin the spleen and head kidney were also significantly elevated than the control groups. Moreover, mRNA levels of tight junction proteins in the intestines of B.s-CotC-CsPmy-10 11 group increased. Potential pathogenetic bacteria with lower abundance and higher abundances of candidate probiotics and bacteria associated with digestion in 1 × 10 11 CFU/g B.s-CotC-CsPmy spores administrated fishes could be detected compared with control group. The amount of metacercaria in per gram fish flesh was statistically decreased in 1 × 10 11 CFU/g B.s-CotC-CsPmy spores orally immunized group. Our work demonstrated that B. subtilis spores presenting CsPmy on the surface could be a promising effective, safe, and needle-free candidate vaccine against C. sinensis infection for grass carp.
9e7f8de1719249f8ece171ed7686ce266aec6d06	The usefulness of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for rapid preclinical detection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection was evaluated. The RT-LAMP reaction could be finished in 60 min under isothermal condition at 65 C by employing a set of four primers targeting the 5 0 untranslated region of CSFV. The RT-LAMP assay of CSFV showed higher sensitivities than that of RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 5 copies per reaction. No cross-reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses including porcine circovirus type 2, porcine parvovirus, porcine pseudorabies virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. The detection rates of CSFV RT-LAMP, RT-PCR and virus isolation for samples including blood, tonsil, nasal and rectal swabs from uninoculated pigs without any clear clinical symptom were 89%, 78% and 71%, respectively. Furthermore, all of the assays showed higher sensitivity for blood and tonsil swabs samples than nasal and rectal swabs. These results indicate that the CSFV RT-LAMP assay is a valuable tool for its rapid, cost-effective detection and has potential usefulness for rapid pre-clinical detection and surveillance of classical swine fever in developing countries.
002fa340aa3b7a5d54ef3aa0e535b84e9e554cd0	The increase of the adoption of IoT devices and the contemporary problem of food production have given rise to numerous applications of IoT in agriculture. These applications typically comprise a set of sensors that are installed in open fields and measure metrics, such as temperature or humidity, which are used for irrigation control systems. Though useful, most contemporary systems have high installation and maintenance costs, and they do not offer automated control or, if they do, they are usually not interpretable, and thus cannot be trusted for such critical applications. In this work, we design Vital, a system that incorporates a set of low-cost sensors, a robust data store, and most importantly an explainable AI decision support system. Our system outputs a fuzzy rule-base, which is interpretable and allows fully automating the irrigation of the fields. Upon evaluating Vital in two pilot cases, we conclude that it can be effective for monitoring open-field installations.
ef55594c9c8ea28ed64d65e29fe14c6322f96773	Objective: To analyse the impact and repercussions of the surge in healthcare demand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, assess the potential effectiveness of various infection/disease control measures, and make projections on the best approach to exit from the current lockdown. Design: A four-compartment model was constructed for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the Wuhan data and validated with data collected in Italy, the UK, and the US. The model captures the effectiveness of various disease suppression measures in three modifiable factors: (a) the per capita contact rate (β) that can be lowered by means of social distancing, (b) infection probability upon contacting infectious individuals that can be lowered by wearing facemasks, personal hygiene, etc., and (c) the population of infectious individuals in contact with the susceptible population, which can be lowered by quarantine. The model was used to make projections on the best approach to exit from the current lockdown. Results: The model was applied to evaluate the epidemiological data and hospital burden in Italy, the UK, and the US. The control measures were identified as the key drivers for the observed epidemiological data through sensitivity analyses. Analysing the different lockdown exit strategies showed that a lockdown exit strategy with a combination of social separation/general facemask use may work, but this needs to be supported by intense

We present a safe & objective triaging method for afflicted with this disease in the prevailing morbid situation.
b4ffcd0614eec614554ca322abf9d7bff6c622b1	Many viruses have been investigated for the development of genetic vaccines and the ideal ones must be endowed with many properties, such as the quality and the quantity of the immunological response induced against the encoded antigens, safety and production on a large scale basis. Viral based vaccines must also deal with the potential problem of the pre-existing antivector immunity. Several viral vaccine vectors have emerged to date, all of them having relative advantages and limits depending on the proposed application. Recent successes re fl ect diverse improvements such as development of new adenovirus serotypes and prime-boost regimes. This chapter describes the features of four viral vector systems based on poxviruses, adenoviruses, alphaviruses and lentiviruses and recent results following their use with a particular emphasis on clinical research, highlighting the challenges and successes.
9cce8c80653a295cf8e653ebf49d821e5d5de10a	Objective: To describe a relatively rare hypersentivity reaction with pulmonary manifestations in a pediatric patient. Data sources: Electronic medical records. Study selection: Patient treatment in the pediatric critical care unit. Data extraction and synthesis: Electronic medical records. Conclusions: Eosinophilic pneumonias are rare in the pediatric population. Peripheral eosinophilia is not necessary to make the diagnosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage is the diagnostic study of choice. Lung biopsies are rarely needed to make the diagnosis. The treatment of choice is steroids. If steroids fail to improve the patient's condition, consider IVIG, and cyclosporine A.
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	The coronavirus 2019 pandemic and related policies have led to an unequal distribution of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. For Black women and birthing people, endemic vulnerabilities and disparities may exacerbate deleterious COVID-19 impacts. Historical and ongoing macro-level policies and forces over time have induced disproportionately higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality among Black women and birthing people, and contemporary macroeconomic and healthcare policies and factors continue to hold particular consequence. These factors induce detrimental psychological, health, and behavioral responses that contribute to maternal health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to disproportionately impact Black women and birthing people, as policy responses have failed to account for the their unique socioeconomic and healthcare contexts. The resulting consequences may form a 'vicious cycle', with upstream impacts that exacerbate upstream macro-level policies and forces that can further perpetuate the clustering of maternal morbidity and mortality in this population. Understanding the impacts of COVID-19 among Black women and birthing people requires theoretical frameworks that can sufficiently conceptualize their multi-level, interacting, and dynamic nature. Thus, we advocate for the proliferation of syndemic perspectives to guide maternal disparities research and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. These perspectives can enable a holistic and nuanced understanding of the intersection of endemic and COVID-19-specific vulnerabilities and disparities experienced by Black women and birthing people. Syndemic-informed research can then lead to impactful multi-level prevention strategies that simultaneously tackle both endemic and COVID-19-specific factors and outcomes that lead to the clustering of vulnerabilities and disparities over time. Significance Black women and birthing people are more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women in the United States. Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and related policies have exacerbated racial maternal health disparities and worsened Black maternal health.
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	Infectious disease outbreaks often have consequences beyond human health, including concern among the population, economic instability, and sometimes violence. A warning system capable of anticipating social disruptions resulting from disease outbreaks is urgently needed to help decision makers prepare appropriately. We designed a system that operates in near real-time to identify and predict social response. Over 150,000 Internet-based news articles related to outbreaks of 16 diseases in 72 countries and territories were provided by HealthMap. These articles were automatically tagged with indicators of the disease activity and population reaction. An anomaly detection algorithm was implemented on the population reaction indicators to identify periods of unusually severe social response. Then a model was developed to predict the probability of these periods of unusually severe social response occurring in the coming week, 2 and 3 weeks. This model exhibited remarkably strong performance for diseases with substantial media coverage. For country-disease pairs with a median of 20 or more articles per year, the onset of social response in the next week was correctly predicted over 60% of the time, and 87% of weeks were correctly predicted. Performance was weaker for diseases with little media coverage, and, for these diseases, the main utility of our system is in identifying social response when it occurs, rather than predicting when it will happen in the future. Overall, the developed near real-time prediction approach is a promising step toward developing predictive models to inform responders of the likely social consequences of disease spread.

Les outils traditionnels du diagnostic virologique comprennent la recherche antigénique directe par immunofl uorescence (IF) ou test immunoenzymatique (EIA), et l'isolement en culture. Les techniques d'IF ou EIA ont une sensibilité en général légèrement inférieure à celle de la culture, mais elles permettent de détecter également une fraction d'échantillons faussement négatifs en culture. Les résultats de plusieurs équipes, utilisant des techniques de reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), montrent que les méthodes moléculaires détectent plus d'échantillons positifs que les méthodes traditionnelles. Le travail est en cours pour élargir le nombre de virus identifi és par des RT-PCR multiplex et découvrir de nouveaux virus, tels le métapneumovirus humain, en cause dans les atteintes respiratoires de l'enfant. En conclusion, afi n de concilier rapidité, contrôle des coûts et un fort taux de détection des virus respiratoires, l'utilisation combinée de l'IF et de la RT-PCR multiplex semble ce jour la meilleure façon de progresser dans le diagnostic des maladies respiratoires de l'enfant. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits réservés. The conventionnal tools used for virological diagnosis include direct antigen detection by immunofl uorescence (IFA) or an immunoenzymatic test (EIA), and viral isolation technique (VIT). In most cases, IFA and EIA have a slightly lower sensitivity than VIT but are also able to detect some VIT-negative samples. Results of several teams using RT-PCR technologies show that the molecular methods detect more positive cases than the conventional tools. Work is under way to expand the number of viruses detected by multiplex RT-PCR and to determine wether newly discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, contribute to burden of paediatric lower respiratory infections. In conclusion, according to requirements of speed, low cost of the methods, and to achieve the highest rate of detection of respiratory viruses, the combined use of IFA and multiplex RT-PCR is today likely to be the best way to improve diagnosis of respiratory illnesses in children.

The virus has killed nearly 50000 people all over the world in only 3 months. These reforms bring major challenges to public health and healthcare system. The Pulmonary pathological features of COVID-19 initial phase are alveolar edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, gravitational consolidations, and interstitial thickening. The art of Lung Ultrasound (LUS) and its evolving applications for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia are widespread. This study aims to evaluate the surveillance value of LUS for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. We will evaluate a systematic search and a meta-analysis of diagnosis Due to the differences in different departments clinicians and different countries, there may be heterogeneity in the results.
31ed13b95edff14dd451ee960dd3a27567a1ded1	Monocytes are a highly plastic innate immune cell population that displays significant heterogeneity within the circulation. Distinct patterns of surface marker expression have become accepted as a basis for distinguishing three monocyte subsets in humans. These phenotypic subsets, termed classical, intermediate and nonclassical, have also been demonstrated to differ in regard to their functional properties and disease associations when studied in vitro and in vivo. Nonetheless, for the intermediate monocyte subset in particular, functional experiments have yielded conflicting results and some studies point to further levels of heterogeneity. Developments in genetic sequencing technology have provided opportunities to more comprehensively explore the phenotypic and functional differences among conventionally-recognized immune cell subtypes as well as the potential to identify novel subpopulations. In this review, we summarize the transcriptomic evidence in support of the existence of three separate monocyte subsets. We also critically evaluate the insights into subset functional distinctions that have been garnered from monocyte gene expression analysis and the potential utility of such studies to unravel subset-specific functional changes which arise in disease states.

Introducción: Durante el estado de alarma sanitaria establecido a causa de la pandemia de la COVID-19 se anularon la mayor parte de las consultas externas presenciales y se estableció una consulta telefónica para el seguimiento de pacientes coloproctológicos. El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar la eficacia de la consulta telefónica (teleconsulta) en el seguimiento de los pacientes de una unidad de coloproctología, en el contexto de la pandemia COVID-19. Método: Estudio descriptivo prospectivo de pacientes consecutivos en un solo centro. Se clasificó el resultado de la teleconsulta como alta, visita resuelta o reprogramación y se analizó por diferentes grupos diagnósticos. Resultados: Del 19 de marzo al 17 de abril de 2020 se realizó la teleconsulta de 190 pacientes. La tasa de respuesta fue del 94,2%(179). Las categorías diagnósticas de los pacientes atendidos fueron: 51(26,9%) neoplasia colorrectal, 48(25,3%) patología proctológica, 72(37,9%) disfunciones del suelo pélvico y 19(10%) otras patologías benignas. 105(55,26%) se pudieron recitar como si hubieran venido de forma presencial. Se dio el alta a 11(5,8%) pacientes. No se encontraron diferencias significativas entre las distintas categorías diagnósticas y la resolución de la teleconsulta. Los motivos de reprogramación se analizan en el estudio. Conclusión: En el contexto de pandemia, la teleconsulta, ha permitido resolver de forma definitiva el 61% de las visitas de seguimiento, evitando la reprogramación de 116 pacientes. El nuevo paradigma social y sanitario tras la pandemia, requerirá un replanteamiento de nuestro modelo de atención sanitaria, y en muchos aspectos la telemedicina puede ofrecer herramientas para ello. Page 2 of 21 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract Introduction: During the state of alarm established in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the face-to-face outpatient consultations were cancelled and a telephone consultation was established to follow up coloproctological patients. The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. Results: From March 19th to April 17 th , 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients. The new social and health paradigm after the pandemic will require a rethinking of our healthcare model, and in many aspects, telemedicine can offer tools for this.
e5eda77b5add970a692565f0bfd52697dacd1ed2	Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients complicated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) Method: We performed a comprehensive literature search of several databases to find studies that assessed VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a primary outcome of all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of VTE sufferers. Results: Eight studies have been included with a total of 1237 pooled subjects. Venous thromboembolism was associated with higher mortality (2.48 (1.35, 4.55), p=0.003; I 2 5%, p=0.35) after we performed sensitivity analysis, ICU admission (RR 2.32 (1.53, 3.52), p<0.0001; 80%, p <0.0001), and mechanical ventilation need (RR 2.73 (1.56, 4.78), p=0.0004; 77%, p=0.001). Furthermore, it was also associated to male gender (RR 1.21 (1.08, 1.35), p=0.0007; I 2 12%, p=0.34), higher white blood cells count (MD 1.24 (0.08, 2.41), 0.04; I 2 0%; 0.26), D-dimer (MD 4.49 (2.74, 6.25), p<0.00001; I 2 67%, p=0.009) and LDH levels (MD 70.93 (19.33, 122.54), p<0.007; I 2 21%, p=0.28). In addition, after sensitivity analysis was conducted, VTE also associated with older age (MD 2.79 (0.06, 5.53), p=0.05; I 2 25%, p=0.24) and higher CRP levels (MD 2.57 (0.88, 4.26); p=0.003; I 2 0%, p=0.96). Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients was associated with increased mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation requirement. Male gender, older age, higher levels of biomarkers, including WBC count, D-Dimer, and LDH were also being considerably risks for developing VTE in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization.
98e4897f897dc42c8dc56b1a8a31b8e853315faa	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the amount of residual obturation material of retroinstrumented surgically resected roots using controlled memory (CM) files and to evaluate the incidence of adverse treatment outcomes. Methods: Thirty maxillary anterior teeth in human cadavers were selected and non-surgical root canal treatment was performed on these teeth. A standardized 4-mm osteotomy and a 3-mm root resection with as close to a zero-degree bevel as possible was made on each tooth. A microsurgical diamond tip was used to create a 1-2 mm starting point for each retropreparation. A 25/06 and 30/06 VTaper 2H (SS White, Lakewood, NJ) were bent at a about 90-degree angle to mimic the clinical and anatomical restrictions and used to create a retropreparation to a depth of 14-mm. Micro-CT scans were taken and analyzed for volume and percentage of residual obturation material at 5-and 10-mm. Additionally, the incidence of instrument separation and crack and ledge formation in the teeth were recorded. Results: The median volume of residual obturation at 5-and 10-mm was 0.18 mm 3 (interquartile range of 0.36 mm 3 ), and 1.97 mm 3 (interquartile range of 1.99 mm 3 ) respectively. The overall incidence of file separation during retropreparation was 13.33% (4/30). Among the cases analyzed with micro-CT, none showed crack or ledge formation. Conclusions: Retroinstrumentation of surgically resected roots using controlled memory files cleans the canal effectively with relatively low adverse treatment outcomes. This novel technique, while limited in application, is a safe and effective way to achieve a deep, clean retropreparation.
1b36b32858911340bc1fda4c2105dd2525843c7a	Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated response measures have led to unprecedented challenges for service providers working with vulnerable children and families around the world. Objective: The goal of the present study was to better understand the impact of the pandemic and associated response measures on vulnerable children and families and provide data-informed recommendations for public and private service providers working with this population. Participants and Setting: Representatives from 87 non-government organizations (NGOs) providing a variety of direct services (i.e. residential care, family preservation, foster care, etc.) to 454,637 vulnerable children and families in 43 countries completed a brief online survey. Methods: Using a mixed methods design, results examined 1) ways in which children and families have been directly impacted by COVID-19, 2) the impact of the pandemic on services provided by NGOs, 3) government responses and gaps in services for this population during the pandemic, and 4) strategies that have been effective in filling these gaps. Results: Data revealed that the pandemic and restrictive measures were associated with increased risk factors for vulnerable children and families, including not having access to vital services. The NGOs experienced government restrictions, decreased financial support, and inability to adequately provide services. Increased communication and supportive activities had a positive impact on both NGO staff and the families they serve. Conclusions: Based on the findings, ten recommendations were made for service providers working with vulnerable children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.
5ced69d4c60f405e23d6cd1de3e0bb8ffb771e9a	Most viruses modify their genomic and mRNA 5 0 -ends with the addition of an RNA cap, allowing efficient mRNA translation, limiting degradation by cellular 5 0 -3 0 exonucleases, and avoiding its recognition as foreign RNA by the host cell. Viral RNA caps can be synthesized or acquired through the use of a capping machinery which exhibits a significant diversity in organization, structure and mechanism relative to that of their cellular host. Therefore, viral RNA capping has emerged as an interesting field for antiviral drug design. Here, we review the different pathways and mechanisms used to produce viral mRNA 5 0caps, and present current structures, mechanisms, and inhibitors known to act on viral RNA capping.

The previous researches on MES integration rarely considered the problem of system data security access. A three-level data security access mechanism based on the independence of the system administrators, security administrators, and security auditors is proposed which integrated into the MES integration framework to guarantee the business and engineering data security access for the related distributed clients. The principle is using the domain to make the logical isolation for different clients and data sources and applying the pre-defined data sharing rules for safe access. In the proposed MES integration framework model, the data interoperation between MES and the engineering software systems is discussed which includes ERP (Enterprise Resource Management), CAPP (Computer Aided Process Planning), DNC (Distribution Numerical Control), WMS (Warehouse Management System), and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), etc., the implementation method of personalized data display GUI is discussed as well. The study is based on the KMMES developed by Wuhan KM-Software of China, and it has been deployed in over forty companies from the sections of aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding and other industries.
012df38102699db78d83961b6dcb2c1138c810c1	The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unprecedented in our professional lives and much effort and resources will be devoted to care of patients (and HCW) affected by this illness. We must also continue to aim for the same standard of care for our non-COVID respiratory patients, while minimizing risks of infection transmission to our colleagues. This commentary addresses the key paired issues of minimizing performance of diagnostic/staging bronchoscopy in patients with suspected/known lung cancer while maximizing the safety of the procedure with respect to HCW transmission of COVID-19.
3380c2147c090bd81525c67d4200fb3860517008	Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a refractory and recurrent inflammatory skin disease. Various factors including heredity, environmental agent, innate and acquired immunity, and skin barrier function participate in the pathogenesis of AD. Thelper (Th) 2-dominant immunological milieu has been suggested in the acute phase of AD. Antigen 85B (Ag85B) is a 30-kDa secretory protein well conserved in Mycobacterium species. Ag85B has strong Th1-type cytokine inducing activity, and is expected to ameliorate Th2 condition in allergic disease. To perform Ag85B function in vivo, effective and less invasive vaccination method is required. Recently, we have established a novel functional virus vector; recombinant human parainfluenza type 2 virus vector (rhPIV2): highly expressive, replication-deficient, and very low-pathogenic vector. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of rhPIV2 engineered to express Ag85B (rhPIV2/Ag85B) in a mouse AD model induced by repeated oxazolone (OX) challenge. Ear swelling, dermal cell infiltrations and serum IgE level were significantly suppressed in the rhPIV2/Ag85B treated mouse group accompanied with elevated IFN-c and IL-10 mRNA expressions, and suppressed IL-4, TNF-a and MIP-2 mRNA expressions. The treated mice showed no clinical symptom of croup or systemic adverse reactions. The respiratory tract epithelium captured rhPIV2 effectively without remarkable cytotoxic effects. These results suggested that rhPIV2/Ag85B might be a potent therapeutic tool to control allergic disorders.

7bd6421206f7ff61993a361896c3ffc02e3d7f51	Real-world datasets often contain many missing values due to several reasons. This is usually an issue since many learning algorithms require complete datasets. In certain cases, there are constraints in the real world problem that create difficulties in continuously observing all data. In this paper, we investigate if graphical causal models can be used to impute missing values and derive additional information on the uncertainty of the imputed values. Our goal is to use the information from a complete dataset in the form of graphical causal models to impute missing values in an incomplete dataset. This assumes that the datasets have the same data generating process. Furthermore, we calculate the probability of each missing data value belonging to a specified percentile. We present a preliminary study on the proposed method using synthetic data, where we can control the causal relations and missing values.
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	The reasons for a wide variation in severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the affected countries of the world are not known. Two recent studies have suggested a link between the BCG vaccination policy and the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. In the present study we compared the impact of COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates (CFR) between countries with high disease burden and those with BCG revaccination policies presuming that revaccination practices would have provided added protection to the population against severe COVID-19. We found a significant difference in the CFR between the two groups of countries. Our data further supports the view that universal BCG vaccination has a protective effect on the course of COVID-19 probably preventing progression to severe disease and death. Clinical trials of BCG vaccine are urgently needed to establish its beneficial role in COVID-19 as suggested by the epidemiological data, especially in countries without a universal BCG vaccination policy.
eb7ed9704b8aca731653e08d7a790c84f4352f37	Posttranslational modifications are increasingly recognized as key strategies used by bacterial and viral pathogens to modulate host factors critical for infection. A number of recent studies illustrate how pathogens use these posttranslational modifications to target central signaling pathways in the host cell, such as the NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways, which are essential for pathogens' replication, propagation, and evasion from host immune responses. These discoveries open new avenues for investigating the fundamental mechanisms of pathogen infection and the development of new therapeutics.

46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	The emergence of the highly pathogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has reignited interest in coronavirus biology and pathogenesis. An emerging theme in coronavirus pathogenesis is that the interaction between specific viral genes and the host immune system, specifically the innate immune system, functions as a key determinant in regulating virulence and disease outcomes. Using SARS-CoV as a model, we will review the current knowledge of the interplay between coronavirus infection and the host innate immune system in vivo, and then discuss the mechanisms by which specific gene products antagonize the host innate immune response in cell culture models. Our data suggests that the SARS-CoV uses specific strategies to evade and antagonize the sensing and signaling arms of the interferon pathway. We summarize by identifying future points of consideration that will contribute greatly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing coronavirus pathogenesis and virulence, and the development of severe disease in humans and animals.
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus strain disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. The admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of COVID-19 include severe hypoxia, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases. The diseases also share similar comorbidity risks including dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic renal failure. Sepsis has been observed in up to 59% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy/drug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe COVID-19 patients. This would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of COVID-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease. As there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed COVID-19 patients correlating their genomic profile, disease severity and outcome, co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors (such as ethnicity, blood group, smoking, BMI etc.), a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible. We therefore ran a study on the UK Biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes, and correlated these with COVID-19 patients. Sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Like the initial studies for COVID-19 patients, standard genome wide association studies (GWAS) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis. We used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from UK Biobank. We identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes, which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis. Many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction, PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling, immune response regulation, aberrant GABA and neurogenic signaling. This study has identified 70 sepsis related genes, many of them for the first time, that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe COVID-19 patients. We have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe COVID-19.
1ebf2746af842ad7998b3528bafabc2243a7d617	Thermoeconomic analysis, a combined application of thermodynamic and economic analyses, has emerged as an important tool to optimize the performance of desalination systems. Contrary to conventional economic analysis, it offers flexibility to investigate and improve the performance of each component in the system, individually. The current paper presents a comprehensive framework for conducting thermoeconomic analysis of desalination systems. In this regard, different energy calculation methods are discussed first. Then a detailed review of theoretical developments of thermoeconomic analyses is conducted to summarize the correlations/magnitude of important economic parameters. This is followed by a discussion on cost balance equations for important desalination components. Finally, a systematic thermoeconomic analysis model is developed for the mechanical vapor compression desalination system operating under different arrangements as an example. The monetary value of each stream calculated using appropriate fiscal parameters in the system is presented in the form of a cost flow diagram. The study can be used to conduct the thermoeconomic analysis of other commercial desalination systems. ⁎ Corresponding authors at: Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology, Rahim
1ee530e6cf6878b8453f003e7e6c099e34469ad5	Background-Recently, several new human coronaviruses have been identified. Study design-A recombinant protein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on portions of the nucleocapsid protein of group I human coronaviruses was developed and was used to screen serum from 243 children and young adults. HCoV-229E, the percentages of seropositive individuals were 57.1% for infants < 2 months old; 38.9% for infants 2-3 months old; 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old; 42.9-50.0% for infants 6-12 months old; and 34.8-62.5% for individuals 1-20 years old. For HCoV-NL63, the percentages of seropositive individuals were 45.2% for infants < 2 months old; 11.1% for infants 2-3 months old; 4.7% for infants 4-5 months old; 28.6-40.0% for infants 6-12 months old; and 25.0-70.3% for individuals 1-20 years old. Conclusions-Infection with these viruses is common in childhood though the prevalence of these viruses may vary from year to year.
76b43ac37334b49675e5448467c20d050c8b3f31	11 Purpose The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anterior chamber fluid and/or the vitreous in 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA on the ocular surface is unclear. Knowledge about the 13 infectious state of intraocular structures could influence the daily work of ophthalmic 14 surgeons. 15 Observations We analyzed ocular samples from a patient who had succumbed to COVID-16 19 pneumonia for the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We detected viral RNA in the ocular-17 surface samples on one swab and in one excidate from the conjunctiva. Samples from the 18 anterior chamber and vitreous revealed no SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 19 Conclusions and Importance SARS-CoV-2 can effectively be inactivated with standard 20 disinfection agents. The now proven absence of SARS-CoV-2 in intraocular fluids could 21 influence how ophthalmic surgeons work. Without having to account for the risk of a 22 contagion via the anterior chamber and/or vitreous body, the surgical staff would require no 23 additional, more elaborate protection. 24 25 Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; Covid-19, ocular surgery; infectious diseases 26 27 28 29 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
a58babc187608d204e7237eceb4daa6e8f9f0fb4	The optical spectra of 3,896 Seyfert 1 (Sy1) galaxies detected with WISE at z < 0.4 were analyzed for evidence of outflows. In 37% of the Sy1s the outflows appear as broad, blue-shifted, of the [OIII]λ5007Å with a mean maximum velocity V max ∼1014 km s −1 , consistent with AGN winds. For each Sy1 we deduced that black hole (BH) mass, bolometric luminosity, Eddington ratio and power-law index of the continuum, which we compared with the star formation rate (SFR) and host morphology. Having separated our sample in two spectroscopic subgroups, Sy1s with only broad Balmer lines (Sy1B) and with both narrow and broad (Sy1N) lines and distinguishing those that show as outflow (Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw), we report the following differences: 1) the BH mass is systematically higher and the powerlaw steeper in the Sy1B-Sy1Bw than in the Sy1N-Sy1Nw, 2) V max is higher in the Sy1Bw than in the Sy1Nw, correlated in both groups with the BH mass and bolometric luminosity, 3) the Eddington ratio and SFR are higher in the Sy1 with outflows, and 4) the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the Sy1s are normal for their morphology and mass; typical of early-type spiral galaxies in the green valley, far from the quenched regime. From these results we conclude that in Sy1s AGN winds are triggered by higher accretion rates and probably radiatively launched, and there is no clear evidence of an effect on the star formation.
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	Recent epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which can be categorized according to its clinical symptoms as typical or atypical, have markedly increased worldwide. A primary causative agent for typical HFMD outbreaks, enterovirus 71 (EV71), has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in S phase for own replication; however, it is not clear whether coxsackievirus (CVA6), the main agent for atypical HFMD, also regulates the host cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CVA6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in G0/G1-phase. Furthermore, synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral production. To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by CVA6 infection, we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at G0/G1 or G2/M. Our results demonstrate that CVA6 infection promotes G0/G1 phase entry from G2/M phase, and inhibits G0/G1 exit into S phase. In line with its role to arrest cells in G0/G1 phase, the expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, P53, P21, and P16 is regulated by CVA6. Finally, the non-structural proteins of CVA6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and protease 3C , are demonstrated to be responsible for the G0/G1-phase arrest. These findings suggest that CVA6 infection arrested cell cycle in G0/G1-phase via non-structural proteins 3D and 3C, which may provide favorable environments for virus production.
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	The 3C-like main peptidase 3CL pro is a viral polyprotein processing enzyme essential for the viability of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). While it is generalized that 3CL pro and the structurally related 3C pro viral peptidases cleave their substrates via a mechanism similar to that underlying the peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (CLSPs), some of the hypothesized key intermediates have not been structurally characterized. Here, we present three crystal structures of SARS 3CL pro in complex with each of two members of a new class of peptide-based phthalhydrazide inhibitors. Both inhibitors form an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of Cys145, trapping the enzyme's catalytic residues in configurations similar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis of native substrates. Most significantly, our crystallographic data are consistent with a scenario in which a water molecule, possibly via indirect coordination from the carbonyl oxygen of Thr26, has initiated nucleophilic attack on the enzyme-bound inhibitor. Our data suggest that this structure resembles that of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate during the deacylation step of normal peptidyl cleavage.
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	A large percentage of the deaths from COVID-19 occur among residents of long-term care facilities. There are two possible reasons for this phenomenon. First, the structural features of such settings may lead to death. Alternatively, it is possible that individuals in these facilities are in poorer health than those living elsewhere, and that these individuals would have died even if they had not been in these facilities. Our findings show that, controlling for the population density, the percentage of older adults in the population, and the number of hospital beds per capita, there is a significant positive association between the number of long-term care beds (LTCB) per capita and COVID-19 mortality rates. This finding provides support for the claim that long-term care living arrangements (of older people) are a significant risk factor for dying from COVID-19.
797d4bc91a5889c5fbcd4a51cbd1459fe277fe58	Intracranial inoculation of immunocompetent mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a fatal neurologic illness. In this disease a marked increase in MHC class I expression was found, closely associated with viral antigens and inflammatory infiltrates, in meninges, choroid plexus and ventricular ependyma but not within the brain parenchyma. Immunosuppression prevented MHC induction. Mice inoculated at birth had persistent infections, with LCMV antigens found primarily in neurons, but no inflammatory cells or focal increase in MHC class I. Failure of infected neurons to express MHC class I allows them to escape destruction by cytotoxic T cells (CTL) but may increase their susceptibility to be persistently infected by non-lytic viruses.
d6bbcc059331dda0ac8c4a897f4d7171d0d1cb99	To substantiate psychological symptoms following humidifier disinfectant (HD) disasters, counseling records of 26 victims and 92 family members of victims (45 were bereaved) were analyzed retrospectively. Among the victims, 34.6% had Clinical Global Impression-Severity scores of over 4, which meant they were moderately ill. While anxiety/fear and depression with respiratory symptoms were frequently observed in victims and family members, chronic psychological distress such as alcohol/smoking abuse and insomnia was relatively high in bereaved family members. In conclusion, it is important to provide mental health support for victims and their families, focusing on the characteristic symptoms of each group as well as monetary compensation.
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	In this manuscript we propose a method for pricing insurance products that cover not only traditional risks, but also unforeseen ones. By considering the Poisson process parameter to be a mixed random variable, we capture the heterogeneity of foreseeable and unforeseeable risks. To illustrate, we estimate the weights for the two risk streams for a real dataset from a Portuguese insurer. To calculate the premium, we set the frequency and severity as distributions that belong to the linear exponential family. Under a Bayesian set-up, we show that when working with a finite mixture of conjugate priors, the premium can be estimated by a mixture of posterior means, with updated parameters, depending on claim histories. We emphasise the riskiness of the unforeseeable trend, by choosing heavy-tailed distributions. After estimating distribution parameters involved using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, we found that Bayesian premiums derived are more reactive to claim trends than traditional ones.
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	The effect of anaesthetic gases given via laryngeal mask on nasal ciliary beat pattern and frequency has not been studied. Anaesthetic gases such as iso¯urane, halothane and en¯urane are known to reduce ciliary beat frequency, but it is unknown whether they also cause cilia to beat in a dyskinetic fashion. Brush biopsies of nasal mucosa were taken pre-and post-anaesthesia with iso¯urane, given via a laryngeal mask, from patients undergoing nasal surgery. The samples were observed by light microscopy, and high-speed digital video recordings were made to determine ciliary beat frequency. Using slow-motion playback, the ciliary beat pattern was scored for dysmotility, and the proportion of immotile cilia in the sample was determined. We found that ciliary beat frequency decreased signi®cantly (P < 0.01) after exposure to iso¯urane (10.24 Hz compared to 9.20 Hz). However, iso¯urane did not alter the ciliary beat pattern or the proportion of immotile cilia.
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	Protein ubiquitination is a highly conserved post-translational modification affecting various biological processes including viral propagation. Ubiquitination has multiple effects on viral propagation, including viral genome uncoating, viral replication, and immune evasion. Ubiquitination of viral proteins is triggered by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). This involves the covalent attachment of the highly conserved 76 amino acid residue ubiquitin protein to target proteins by the consecutive actions of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes, and the 26S proteasome that together form a multiprotein complex that degrades target proteins. The UPS is the primary cytosolic proteolytic machinery for the selective degradation of various forms of proteins including viral proteins, thereby limiting viral growth in host cells. To combat this host anti-viral machinery, viruses have evolved the ability to employ or subvert the UPS to inactivate or degrade cellular proteins to favour viral propagation. This review highlights our current knowledge on the different roles of the UPS during viral propagation.
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	This paper describes the increasing role of ontologies in the context of Grid computing for obtaining, comparing and analyzing distributed heterogeneous scientific data. In the communities of people committed to a common goal, the management of resources and services becomes very important. We chose the application domain of human disease research and control. A characteristic of the domain is that trusted databases exist but their schemas are often poorly or not documented. The network of biomedical databases forms a loose federation of autonomous, distributed, heterogeneous data repositories ripe for information integration. Grid services will provide a dynamic way to use resources in such a large distributed scientific environment while the use of ontology enables the system to carryout reasoning at 3 levels: a) available information in all Bio-Databases (Grid nodes) worldwide, b) reasoning about the retrievable information from each node, c) reasoning about the retrieved information and presenting it in a meaningful format for users. We adopted the ontology design methodology of DOGMA and developed Generic Human Disease Ontology (GenDO) that contains common general information regarding human diseases. The information is represented in 4 "dimensions": (a) disease types, (b) causes (c) symptoms and (d) treatments. We illustrate how this GenDO helps to produce Specific Human Disease Ontologies (SpeDO) on request. We show how the combination of two different but complementary techniques, namely Grid computing and ontology, results in a dynamic and intelligent information system. The two approaches together, being complementary, enable the system as a whole. Recent developments in integrating parallel and distributed computing, combined with improvements in overall network bandwidth have made it possible to add a new dimension to distributed computing: the Grid. Grid offers data management facilities and access to distributed resources by providing cross-institutional integration of information and resources in an environment. Grid means resource integration and collaboration [13] .
3d921c03dc23ee850655ddfd9d5ebe3956d70bf8	The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 remains uncertain, which has important implications for estimating transmission potential, forecasting epidemic trends, and decision-making in prevention and control. Purpose: To estimate the central tendency and dispersion for incubation period of COVID-19 and, in turn, assess the effect of a certain length of quarantine for close contacts in active monitoring. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and arXiv, : medRxiv preprint 2 / 16 Data Extraction: From each recruited study, either individual-level incubation period data or summarized statistics for central tendency and dispersion measures were extracted, as well as population characteristics including sample size, average age, and male proportion. Data Synthesis: Fifty-six studies encompassing 4 095 cases were included in this meta-analysis. The estimated median incubation period for general transmissions was 5.8 days [95% confidence interval (95%CI), 5.3 to 6.2 d]. Median and dispersion were higher for SARS-CoV-2 incubation compared to other viral respiratory infections. Furthermore, about 20 in 10 000 contacts in active monitoring would develop symptoms after 14 days, or below 1 in 10 000 for young-age infections or asymptomatic transmissions. Limitation: Small sample sizes for subgroups; some data were possibly used repeatedly in different studies; limited studies for outside mainland China; non-negligible intra-study heterogeneity. The long, dispersive incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to the global spread of COVID-19. Yet, a 14-day quarantine period is sufficient to trace and identify symptomatic infections, which while could be justified according to a better understanding of the crucial parameters.
107f0d5a47f48f85d6645cac0e7008edc4d9d8cd	Public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek transdisciplinary understanding of infection in wildlife hosts. With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or "species", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts.

9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	CD200, a type I membrane glycoprotein, plays an important role in prevention of inflammatory disorders, graft rejection, autoimmune diseases and spontaneous fetal loss. It also regulates tumor immunity. A truncated CD200 (CD200 tr ) resulting from alternative splicing has been identified and characterized as a functional antagonist to full-length CD200. Thus, it is important to explore the mechanism(s) controlling alternative splicing of CD200. In this study, we identified an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) located in exon 2, which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein SF2/ ASF. Deletion or mutation of the ESE site decreased expression of the full-length CD200. Direct binding of SF2/ASF to the ESE site was confirmed by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Knockdown of expression of SF2/ASF resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ESE, whereas overexpression of SF2/ASF increased expression of the full-length CD200. In vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of CD200 with increased expression of SF2/ASF and the full-length CD200. Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that SF2/ASF regulates the function of CD200 by controlling CD200 alternative splicing, through direct binding to an ESE located in exon 2 of CD200.

354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	COVID-19 is an extremely infectious disease with a relatively large virus incubation period in the affected people who may be asymptomatic. Therefore, to reduce the transmission of this pathogen, several countries have taken many intervention measures. In this paper, we show that the impact of these measures in India is different from several other countries. It is shown that an early lockdown in late March 2020 changed the initial exponential growth curve of COVID-19 to a linear one, but a surge in the number of cases from late April 2020 brought India back to a quadratic trajectory. A regional analysis shows the disparate impact of the intervention in different states. It is further shown that the number of reported infections correlates with the number of tests, and therefore regions with limited diagnostics resources may not have a realistic estimate of the virus spread. This insufficiency of diagnostic test data is also reflected in an increasing positivity rate for India nearly 2.5 months after the lockdown, inconsistent with the trends observed for other geographical regions. Nonetheless, future projections are made using different epidemiological models based on the available data, and a comparative study is presented. In the absence of a reliable estimate of the true number of infections, these projections will have a limited accuracy: with that limitation, the most optimistic prediction suggests a continuing virus transmission through September 2020.
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	Wide heterogeneity of disease course ranging from asymptomatic spread 1, 2 to respiratory failure and death 3, 4 has become a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. While this clinical spectrum is well documented, its immunologic underpinnings are less clear. We have therefore initiated studies of the B cell responses as they would participate in both early effector responses and in the initiation of memory formation. In terms of effector responses, we were particularly interested in the engagement and clinical correlates of the extra-follicular pathway (EF) we recently described in flaring SLE 5 . In this systemic autoimmune disease, the EF pathway is initiated by newly activated naïve B cell (aN) leading to large expansion of autoantibody-producing antibody-secreting cells through the generation of an epigenetically primed B cell precursor which are double negative (DN) for naïve (IgD) and memory markers (CD27) and lacking expression of CXCR5 and CD21 (DN2) 6, 7, 8 . These highly activated D2 cells are also distinguished by high expression of CD11c and T-bet and are TLR7-driven. Both TLR7-stimulation which is triggered by ssRNA and the central role played by their murine counterparts (typically characterized as Age-Associated B cells), in viral clearance, strongly supported the hypothesis that DN2 cells and the global EF pathway could be prominently engaged in COVID-19 patients 9 . Also of note, EF B cell activation is particularly prominent in SLE patients of African-American ancestry, a population disproportionately represented in severe COVID-19 6, 9 . In this study we find that critically ill patients with COVID-19 robustly upregulate B cells within the extrafollicular pathway, produce enormous numbers of antibody secreting cells, and lose unique transitional B cell populations that correlate with positive prognosis. This patient cluster associates tightly with biomarkers of poor outcomes and exhibits high rates of mortality. Thus, this B cell phenotype might serve as an immunological marker of severe COVID-19 infection at early stages and could therefore identify a patient subset likely to benefit from targeted immunomodulatory therapy aimed at alleviating disease burden. : medRxiv preprint 3 of COVID-19 + patient ASCs revealed a significant increase over healthy controls (Fig 1d) , and substantial ASC maturation as indicated by high expression of the plasma cell marker CD138 (Fig 1e) . Counterintuitively, while ASC generation and maturation are often correlates of protection in vaccine responses 22 , in patients with COVID-19 increased ASC instead portended negative disease outcomes with ICU-admitted patients presenting with significantly more ASCs than their HD and outpatient counterparts (Fig 1f) . Closer examination of the initial clustering separated the COVID-19+ patients into two distinct clusters. By removing the healthy donors and re-clustering, two groups of COVID-19 patients resulted with strong upregulation of the EF response pathway (EF-Cov), and those with a muted EF response but enhanced transitional B cell signal (Tr-COV) (Fig 2a) . This was not a reflection of infection duration as both clusters were sampled at similar times post symptom onset (Fig 2b) . Re-assessment of ASC expansion revealed significantly higher frequencies in the EF-CoV cluster, averaging >10% of CD19+ B cells -well above frequencies after robust vaccine responses that include quadrivalent influenza virus, hepatitis A, tetanus toxoid, and yellow fever vaccines (Fig 2c) . Enriched ASC maturation, and increases in the aN and DN2 B cell compartments also correlated with ASC expansion within the EF-CoV cluster, but not in the Tr-CoV cluster or healthy donors (Fig   2d-e) . Surprisingly, the composition of the DN compartment, a key indicator of EF response skewing, appeared almost identical to patients with active SLE in the replacement of the switch-memory (sM) associated DN1 population with the ASC-associated DN2 subset (Fig 2f-h) . EF response characterization has identified the pathway as peripherally focused, inflammatory, and highly associated with IL-6 and IP-10 23, 24 . Indeed, chemokine receptor analysis of EF populations showed a significant decrease in central homing predisposition (CD62L, CXCR5) (Fig 2i) . Instead, CXCR3 expression across the subsets, coupled with increased levels of IP-10 within the plasma of the EF-Cov cluster is highly suggestive of peripheral homing to inflamed tissue sites as described in both lung 25 and kidney 26 (Fig 2j-k) . Indeed, the two highest cytokine correlates of the EF pathway, IP-10 and IL-6 23, 24 , are strongly upregulated in EF-Cov cluster and reflect the associations with poor outcome prognosis in emerging SARS-CoV-2 literature 27, 28 (Fig 2k-l) .

In the current epidemiological context, clinical and biological work-up led to a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Unfortunately, one of the patients died during hospitalization, but the other recovered and was discharged. LEARNING POINTS • In the current epidemiological situation, anosmia and dysgeusia in the absence of other respiratory conditions should be carefully evaluated. • Special attention should be given to patients with non-classic COVID-19 symptoms in order to reduce transmission and protect health providers
ba67fce2eafcacf3a4b97bc1e74d0d3037f01ba4	Understanding concurrent and parallel programming can be a very hard task on first contact by students. This paper describes the development and experimental results of the FSP2JAVA tool. The proposed method starts from concurrent systems modeling through Finite State Processes (FSP). After that, the method includes an automatic code generation from the model. This goal is achieved by a domainspecific language compiler which translates from the FSP model to Java code. The FSP2JAVA tool is available for free download in the github site. We argue that this tool helps in teaching concurrent systems, since it abstracts all complex languages concern and encourages the student to be focused at the fundamental concepts of modeling and analysis.
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	Pure solitons are for the first time distilled from the resonant continuous wave (CW) background in a fiber laser by utilizing nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT). It is identified that the soliton and the resonant CW background have different eigenvalue distributions in the nonlinear frequency domain. Similar to water distillation, we propose the approach of soliton distillation, by making NFT on a steady pulse generated from a fiber laser, then filtering out the eigenvalues of the resonant CW background in the nonlinear frequency domain, and finally recovering the soliton by inverse NFT (INFT). Simulation results verify that the soliton can be distinguished from the resonant CW background in the nonlinear frequency domain and pure solitons can be obtained by INFT. The term 'soliton' refers to the localized solution of integral nonlinear systems [1]. Solitons are the balanced product of diffraction and nonlinearity, where they can propagate without distortion in the medium. In optics, solitons can be generated by a cancellation of nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium. Due to the anomalous dispersion of fiber, the existence of solitons in optical fibers was theoretically predicted [2] and experimentally verified [3], which greatly promoted the exploration of solitons in nonlinear systems. Due to the natural information representor of "1" for binary communication, ultrashort pulse duration and distortion-less transmission, solitons are considered as a perfect candidate for high-speed telecommunications in fiber optical transmissions [4]. Strictly speaking, solitons only exist in conservative systems, for example, a system that can be governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). With a loose definition, ultrashort pulses generated in a fiber laser can be considered as solitons, since the pulse repeats itself at a fixed position in the fiber laser under the condition of steady state. Solitons generated in fiber lasers can be considered as an averaged soliton when all cavity parameters are distributed [5]. To achieve soliton generation in fiber lasers, various passive mode-locking techniques are applied [6][7][8]. Different from pulse propagation in a fiber where the system is conservative under the assumption of propagation without loss, a fiber laser is a dissipative system where gain and loss affect the pulse generation while simultaneously it is a periodic boundary system. Independent of detailed mode-locking mechanism, solitons generated in fiber lasers experience periodical disturbances, such as gain and loss, and release the excess energy as dispersive waves. If the phase difference between the soliton and the dispersive wave is multiples of 2 , they will interfere with each other and Kelly sidebands will symmetrically appear on the spectrum [9]. In addition, incoherent sidebands may appear on the spectrum too [10]. Here, both Kelly sidebands and incoherent sidebands are collectively referred to the resonant continuous wave (CW) background. As Kelly sidebands coherently interfere with solitons, it is challenging to get rid of them. People always used an external spectral filter to filter out the CW component before amplifying the soliton for specific applications [11]. However, spectral filtering simultaneously changes solitons. So far, no method has been proposed to separate solitons from the parasitic resonant CW background. Alternatively, people prefer to use the appearance of Kelly sidebands as a criterion to verify the generation of soliton [12,13]. The true optical spectrum of a pure soliton generated from a fiber laser is so far unknown. It is interesting to know the details of a pure soliton, instead of a composite of a soliton and the resonant CW background. The coherent and incoherent spectral sidebands of the composite spectrum have been identified by using the dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) technique [10]. To separate a soliton from the mixture of solitons and the resonant CW background from a fiber laser can answer a fundamental distress that what is the real difference between a soliton from a conservative system and a dissipative system. The implementation of pure solitons would also rule out background induced soliton interaction [14], which will greatly simplify analysis of soliton interaction in nonlinear systems. Recently, an elegant method of nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) has attracted worldwide research interests [15], which can
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	A phenomenological approach is proposed to monitor the propagation of the COVID-19pandemic first waves. A large set of data collected at a worldwide scale during the first months of 2020 is compiled into series of semi-logarithmic plots, for a selection of thirty-two countries from the five continents. Three regimes are identified in the propagation of an epidemic wave: a pre-epidemic regime 1, an exponential-growth regime 2, and a resorption regime 3. A two-parameters scaling of the first-wave death variation reported in China is used to fit those reported in other countries. Comparison is made between the propagation of the pandemic in different countries, which are classified in four groups, from group A where the pandemic first waves were contained efficiently, to group D where the pandemic first waves widely spread. Group A is mainly composed of Asian countries, where fast and efficient measures have been applied. Group D is composed of Western-Europe countries and the United States of America, where late decisions and confused political communication (pandemic seriousness, protection masks, herd immunity etc.) led to significant death tolls. The threat of large resurging epidemic waves after a hasty lockdown lift is discussed, in particular for the countries from group D, where the number of contagious people remained high in the beginning of May 2020. The situation is opposite in Asian countries from group A, where the number of contagious people was successfully maintained to a low level. In particular, the results obtained by Hong Kong and South Korea are highlighted, and the measures taken there are presented as virtuous examples that other countries may follow.

90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	The sample is generated cross-sectionally, but can also be thought of as survival data. Each fit test provides interval censored information: masks observed to fail a fit test at time t failed at some point in (0, t) (masks are assumed to have been initially functional). Masks that pass the fit test fail some time in the future (t, t max ). For survival analysis we assume that each mask is independent with failure hazard from from a common distribution. Our parametric survival model fits a 3-parameter generalized gamma hazard to the interval censored data. Non-parametric or semi-parametric estimators which do not assume a functional form of the hazard are common in traditional survival analysis, and are available for interval censored data as well. However, nonparametric estimates (NPMLE) for interval censored data are not unique; in some regions any baseline hazard matching continuity requirements is equally supported by the data. Confidence intervals for interval censored baseline hazards are an active area of research (Wang et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2019), with completely nonparametric estimation methods yielding slow n 1 3 convergence without a known asymptotic law (Groeneboom and Wellner 1992). Several semi-parametric methods have recently been shown to have n 1 2 convergence with Gaussian asymptotics making them amenable to bootstrapping (Wang et al. 2016; Bouaziz, Lauridsen, and Nuel 2018; Zhao et al. 2019; Li, Pak, and Todem 2019). Proportional hazards regression was used to model factors other than duration of use in this framework. Modeling the data as cross-sectional observations of fit passing versus failure as a function of time is also supportable because no participant-mask pair is observed more than once and there is minimal information to support extrapolation from before the earliest test time. Because only a very small number of individuals are tested on more than one mask, we do not model or adjust for participant effects. Integrated b-splines and constrained step functions allow modeling the failure log-odds as a monotone increasing function of time in a traditional logistic regression analysis. This approach yields much better studied statistical behavior; however, given the modest sample size the probability statements produced should be taken as approximate. The cross-sectional model does not encode any behavior before the earliest test time (e.g. that all masks initially fit). We found that the cross-sectional model and non-parametric and semi-parametric survival models yield essentially identical point estimates when tuned appropriately, which is anticipated based on the use of step functions and splines to model the baseline hazard in the survival routines. Factors beyond use duration were analyzed with proportional hazards regression (interval survival) or logistic regression (cross sectional). Calculations were performed in R 3.6.3 with package flexsurv (Jackson 2016) for parametric survival modeling, icenReg (Anderson-Bergman 2017) for non-parametric survival modeling, and cgam (Liao and Meyer 2019) for monotone logistic regression.

Conclusions: The armored RNA with 1,891 bases exogenous RNA was constructed and the expression system can be used as a platform for preparation of the armored RNA containing long RNA sequences. The armored RNA is a noninfectious recombinant pseudoviral particle, which is used as a calibration standard or internal assay control, because the packaged RNA is resistant to RNase digestion. The template RNA can be easily extracted from the armored RNA standard particles by using common RNA extraction methods, which make the RNA available as an RNA standard for quantification, RNA size standards and a transient gene expression system in vitro or in vivo [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . A preferred strategy for producing the armored RNA is by self-assembly of coat protein of the MS2 bacteriophage.

Methods: The plasmid pET-MS2-pac was constructed with one C-variant pac site, and then the plasmid pM-CR-2C containing 1,891-bp chimeric sequences and two C-variant pac sites was produced. Meanwhile, three plasmids (pM-CR-C, pM-CR-2W and pM-CR-W) were obtained as parallel controls with a different number and affinity of the pac site . Finally, the armored RNA was expressed and purified. Results: The armored RNA with 1,891 bases target RNA was expressed successfully by the one-plasmid expression system with two C-variant pac sites , while for one pac site , no matter whether the affinity was changed or not, only the 1,200 bases target RNA was packaged. It was also found that the C-variant pac site could increase the expression efficiency of the armored RNA.

4b4c8d31ce1d963ed055dbf0864758ea16762a11	Although there is a significant amount of literature that deals with the identification of plant viral proteins involved in membrane remodeling and vesicle production in infected cells, there are very few investigations that report on the impact that infection has on the overall architecture and dynamics of the early secretory endomembranes. Recent investigations have shown that for some viruses the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies and other organelles are heavily recruited into virusinduced perinuclear structures. These structures are not isolated organelles and are dynamically connected to the bulk of non-modified endomembranes. They also have a functional link with peripheral motile vesicles involved in virus intracellular movement. The full molecular events that consubstantiate with this endomembrane recruitment in virus-induced structures remain to be elucidated but viral genome replication and virion assembly are probably taking place within these structures.

The MeOH extracts of the fruits of the Paulownia tree yielded many small molecules capable of targeting PLpro. Five of these compounds were new geranylated flavonoids, tomentin A, tomentin B, tomentin C, tomentin D, tomentin E (1-5). Structure analysis of new compounds (1-5) by NMR showed that they all contain a 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety. This chemotype is very rare and is derived from cyclization of a geranyl group with a phenol functionality. Most compounds (1-12) inhibited PLpro in a dose dependent manner with IC 50 's raging between 5.0 and 14.4 lM. All new compounds having the dihydro-2H-pyran group showed better inhibition than their parent compounds (1 vs 11, 2 vs 9, 4 vs 12, 5 vs 6). In kinetic studies, 1-12 emerged to be reversible, mixed inhibitors.
5140264a43a83ae13192a7d2d3c75ae24f918d6c	Background: Among food pantry users there is a high prevalence of both smoking and food insecurity, which may be related to one another. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a smoking cessation program carried out in food pantries on the smoking status and the food security status of food pantry users. Methods / design: Before starting the cluster randomised controlled trial, stakeholders will be engaged to adapt a behavioural group counselling program for smoking cessation to the needs of the food pantry users in a pre study. Food pantry users and workers as well as other experts, such as smoking cessation trainers, social workers, and psychologists, will be involved, using the world café technique and telephone interviews and a qualitative thematic analysis for data analysis to design the concept of the intervention program will be applied. In the second phase, the impact of the intervention on the smoking status and on food insecurity will be investigated by a cluster randomised controlled trial. A total of 416 food pantry users across 32 clusters (food pantries) in Berlin, Germany, should be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the waiting list control group. The intervention will consist of a behavioural group counselling program for smoking cessation, specially tailored for food pantry users, as well as optional nicotine replacement therapy and the implementation of environmental smoking reduction measures in the food pantries. The primary outcomes 6 months after the treatment will be selfreported continuous smoking abstinence, validated by exhaled carbon monoxide (< 10 ppm of carbon monoxide), and increased food security level (the percentage of participants with an improved food security level).

Results from cross-sectional and cohort studies show that asthma starts in childhood in a large proportion of cases. A proper diagnosis is easier to make in adults and school-age children, as permanent changes in lung development, the strong impact of environmental factors on the airways, the immunologic maturity process, and the use of some diagnostic tools make asthma more difficult to diagnose in preschool children. This period of a child's life is an interesting challenge for pediatricians and specialists. The aim of the present review is to analyze the current knowledge regarding making an early and accurate asthma diagnosis and therefore deciding on the correct treatment to gain control over asthma symptoms and minimize health risks.
49d38b24e73f9fc1e483f13ca5b9cbfc298fcd95	Camels are livestock that exhibit unique morphological, biochemical, and behavioral traits, which arose by natural and artificial selection. Investigating the molecular basis of camel traits has been limited by: (1) the absence of a comprehensive record of morphological trait variation (e.g., diseases) and the associated mode of inheritance, (2) the lack of extended pedigrees of specific trait(s), and (3) the long reproductive cycle of the camel, which makes the cost of establishing and maintaining a breeding colony (i.e., monitoring crosses) prohibitively high. Overcoming these challenges requires (1) detailed documentation of phenotypes/genetic diseases and their likely mode of inheritance (and collection of related DNA samples), (2) conducting association studies to identify phenotypes/genetic diseases causing genetic variants (instead of classical linkage analysis, which requires extended pedigrees), and (3) validating likely causative variants by screening a large number of camel samples from different populations. We attempt to address these issues by establishing a systematic way of collecting camel DNA samples, and associated phenotypic information, which we call the "Cdrom Archive." Here, we outline the process of building this archive to introduce it to other camel researchers (as an example). Additionally, we discuss the use of this archive to study the phenotypic traits of Arabian Peninsula camel breeds (the "Mezayen" camels). Using the Cdrom Archive, we report variable phenotypic traits related to the coat (color, length, and texture), ear and tail lengths, along with other morphological measurements.
f64907d42f432259a2c915ac997745af8359b1dc	Objective: This study aimed to assess the presence of novel coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Methods: A prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 30 confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients were selected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from 26 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. At an interval of 2 to 3 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice with disposable sampling swabs for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Results: Twenty-one common-type and nine severe-type NCP patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from the only one patient with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT-PCR results. Fifty-eight samples from other patents were all negative. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis.

Based on in vitro data, CHOICES (CHlorOquine and Imatinib Combination to Eliminate Stem cells) was an international, randomised phase II trial designed to study the safety and efficacy of imatinib (IM) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) compared with IM alone in CP-CML patients in major cytogenetic remission with residual disease detectable by qPCR. Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to either arm. Treatment 'successes' was the primary end point, defined as ≥0.5 log reduction in 12-month qPCR level from trial entry. Selected secondary study end points were 24-month treatment 'successes', molecular response and progression at 12 and 24 months, comparison of IM levels, and achievement of blood HCQ levels >2000 ng/ml. At 12 months, there was no difference in 'success' rate (p = 0.58); MMR was achieved in 80% (IM) vs 92% (IM/HCQ) (p = 0.21). At 24 months, the 'success' rate was 20.8% higher with IM/HCQ (p = 0.059). No patients progressed. Seventeen serious adverse events, including four serious adverse reactions, were reported; diarrhoea occurred more frequently with combination. IM/HCQ is tolerable in CP-CML, with modest improvement in qPCR levels at 12 and 24 months, suggesting autophagy inhibition maybe of clinical value in CP-CML.

As a result, various public health measures have been taken that led to delaying the first confirmed case of COVID-19 until March 10, 2020, and with no intensive care admissions or deaths until July 6, 2020. These measures included promoting universal personal protection and preventions, such as the use of face masks and handwashing, restricting international travel, suspending all training and educational activities from kindergartens to universities, and banning major public gatherings such as the celebration of the national New Year holiday. These measures have been accompanied by active infection surveillance and self-isolation recommendations. The Mongolian case shows that with robust preventive systems, an effective response to a pandemic can be mounted in a low-income or middle-income country. We hereby examine the emergency preparedness experience, effectiveness, and challenges of the early outbreak policies on COVID-19 prevention in Mongolia, as well as any unintended consequences.

18890e35816452e85a1db8c7a9974ae62c5e10ee	A simplified mathematical model of oral hydrocortisone delivery in adrenal insufficiency is described; the model is based on three components (gastric hydrocortisone, free serum cortisol and bound serum cortisol) and is formulated in terms of linear kinetics, taking into account the dynamics of glucocorticoid-protein binding. Motivated by the need to optimise cortisol replacement in the situations of COVID-19 infection, the model is fitted to recently-published data on 50 mg dosing and earlier data on 10 mg dosing. The fitted model is used to predict typical responses to standard dosing regimes, which involve a larger dose in the morning and 1 or 2 smaller doses later in the day, and the same regimes with doses doubled. In all cases there is a circadian-like response, with early morning nadir. The model is also used to consider an alternative dosing strategy based on four equal and equally-spaced doses of 10, 20 or 30 mg per 24 h, resulting in a more even response resembling a response to sustained inflammatory stress.
575eb53a312d827a688f809be60e1eb0bc52d99d	Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was primarily detected in 2012 and still causing disease in human and camel. Camel and bats have been identified as a potential source of virus for disease spread to human. Although, significant information related to MERS-CoV disease, spread, infection, epidemiology, clinical features have been published, A little information is available on the sequence diversity of Spike protein gene. The Spike protein gene plays a significant role in virus attachment to host cells. Recently, the information about recombinant MERS-CoV has been published. So, this work was designed to identify the emergence of any another recombinant virus in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods: In this study samples were collected from both human and camels and the Spike protein gene was amplified and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of MERS-CoV Spike protein gene were used to analyze the recombination, genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship with selected sequences from Saudi Arabia. Results: The nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 65.7% to 99.8% among all the samples collected from human and camels from various locations in the Kingdom. The lowest similarity (65.7%) was observed in samples from Madinah and Dammam. The phylogenetic relationship formed different clusters with multiple isolates from various locations. The sample collected from human in Jeddah hospital formed a closed cluster with human samples collected from Buraydah, while camel sample formed a closed cluster with Hufuf isolates. The phylogenetic tree by using Aminoacid sequences formed closed cluster with Dammam, Makkah and Duba isolates. The amino acid sequences variations were observed in 28/35 samples and two unique amino acid sequences variations were observed in all samples analyzed while total 19 nucleotides sequences variations were observed in the Spike protein gene. The minor recombination events were identified in eight different sequences at various hotspots in both human and camel samples using recombination detection programme. Conclusion: The generated information from this study is very valuable and it will be used to design and develop therapeutic compounds and vaccine to control the MERS-CoV disease spread in not only in the Kingdom but also globally.
5df25b46c3f42c20960c6e6e0caeb981b2f7759d	Background: Theaflavins (TFs) are a category of natural compounds characterized with the benzotropolone skeleton. The prominent benefits of TFs have been well documented. Amount of research were conducted and excellent achievements were disclosed during the past years. However, as far as we know, there is no comprehensive review about TFs. Scope and approach: This review summarized the recent research progress. The activity of TFs on anti-oxidation, anti-mutagenicity, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral effect as well as the epidemiological cure were sorted. Converging pioneer literature and deduction, the underlying formation mechanism of TFs was proposed. Subsequently, acquisition of TFs was pointed out to be the fundament for further research. Accelerated by enzyme, bio-synthesis of TFs were reviewed simultaneously. At the end, employing modern analysis instrument and technology, isolations of TFs were enumerated. Key findings and conclusions: Structure of the skeleton as well as functional groups were paramount related with the bio-activity of TFs. Meanwhile, oxidation pathway of two catechin molecules to form TFs were hypothesized. Also, ascertainment of the several therapeutic efficiency of the family members of TFs would be the next step in the future. ARTICLE HISTORY
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	Microbiome-host interactions play significant roles in health and in various diseases including autoimmune disorders. Uncovering these inter-kingdom cross-talks propels our understanding of disease pathogenesis and provides useful leads on potential therapeutic targets. Despite the biological significance of microbe-host interactions, there is a big gap in understanding the downstream effects of these interactions on host processes. Computational methods are expected to fill this gap by generating, integrating, and prioritizing predictions-as experimental detection remains challenging due to feasibility issues. Here, we present MicrobioLink, a computational pipeline to integrate predicted interactions between microbial and host proteins together with host molecular networks. Using the concept of network diffusion, MicrobioLink can analyse how microbial proteins in a certain context are influencing cellular processes by modulating gene or protein expression. We demonstrated the applicability of the pipeline using a case study. We used gut metaproteomic data from Crohn's disease patients and healthy controls to uncover the mechanisms by which the microbial proteins can modulate host genes which belong to biological processes implicated in disease pathogenesis. MicrobioLink, which is agnostic of the microbial protein sources (bacterial, viral, etc.), is freely available on GitHub. Cells 2020, 9, 1278 2 of 15 known to have negative impacts on the host [7] . Most of the inferences between microbial composition changes and disease phenotypes have been based on associations and correlations, with little explanations of the mechanisms driving the phenotypes. Studying microbiome-host interactions and its influence on host biological mechanisms is important for monitoring health and disease and for discovering/fine-tuning therapeutic interventions. Such interactions are mediated by the interplay between various molecular components expressed by the host and the microbiome. For example, bacterial molecules such as metabolites [8], proteins [9-12], and small RNAs [13] can interact with host molecules and, through host intracellular pathways and regulatory networks, can modulate the expression of genes in various biological processes [14] [15] [16] , thus maintaining healthy states or transition to diseased states. Besides the metabolite-mediated interactions, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are one of the most relevant types of molecular interplay between microbes and host organisms [12] . Experimental techniques to test interspecies PPIs are time consuming and have limitations imposed by cost [1, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Hence, there is a dearth of validated interspecies PPIs in publicly available databases, and these are mostly limited to pathogens. However, using predicted microbe-host PPIs, it is possible to build interaction networks to better understand the cross-talk between the microbial and host proteins and how these interactions interfere with host metabolism and physiology [22] . Recent studies have also shown how protein-protein interactions between emerging pathogens such as COVID-19 and the host have enabled the discovery of potential drug candidates for clinical testing and validation [23] . Various resources and pipelines which generate or store microbe-host interaction predictions are currently available. They include PHISTO [24], PATRIC [25], Proteopathogen2 [26], VirBase [27], and HPIDB [28]. Most of these resources store PPIs and/or genomic analysis of virulence but are limited to pathogens [22]. Tools such as COBRA [29], RAVEN [30], NetCooperate [31], and Kbase [32] which consider commensal microbes are based on the use of metabolomics data alone [33] . Moreover, most of the existing resources and pipelines are confined to predicting the direct molecular interactions at the microbe-host interface and do not infer the downstream effects on functional processes and host signalling pathways. To fill these gaps in understanding the effect of the microbiome on the host, we introduce MicrobioLink-a computational pipeline to analyse microbiome-host interactions at a cellular level using network and systems biology approaches. Using MicrobioLink, it is possible to identify potential pathways by which microbes can modulate the expression of key host molecules such as genes, proteins, or microRNAs. In order to demonstrate the applicability of MicrobioLink, we performed a case study investigating how the gut microbiome potentially modulates autophagy genes in Crohn's disease (CD). By providing custom-made lists of microbial proteins, host receptor proteins, molecular interaction networks, and the target node sets, users can harness the functionalities of MicrobioLink to understand the mechanisms which mediate the influence of microbial proteins derived from the individual microbes or the microbiome.
30681359b04febf00baa33cce43fc7d2236c9561	SARS-CoV-2 is a highly virulent and deadly RNA virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic and several deaths across the world. The pandemic is so fast that any concrete theory of sudden widespread of this disease is still not known. In this work, we studied and analyzed a large number of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the world using the multifractal approach. The mutation events in the isolates obey the Markov process and exhibit very high mutational rates, which occur in six specific genes and highest in orf1ab gene, leading to virulent nature. f (α) analysis indicated that the isolates are highly asymmetric (left-skewed), revealing the richness of complexity and dominance by large fluctuations in genome structure organization. The values of Hq and Dq are found to be significantly large, showing heterogeneous genome structure self-organization, strong positive correlation in organizing the isolates, and quite sensitive to fluctuations in and around it. We then present multiple-isolates hosts-virus interaction models, and derived Price equation for the model. The phase plane analysis of the model showed asymptotic stability type bifurcation. The competition among the mutant isolates drives the trade-off of the dominant mutant isolates, otherwise confined to the present hosts.
8c248b7ecd86825a3926cd16c51e89bcc7d63aaf	Background. Infectious complications of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy in children and young adults have not been well described. Methods. Medical records of patients ≤26 years old receiving CD19 CAR T-cell infusion (CTI) at a single institution between 2014 and 2017 were reviewed. The number of infections per 100 days-at-risk (infection density) in the 90 days preceding and 0-28 and 29-90 days after CTI was calculated. Poisson regression and Cox analyses were utilized to identify risk factors for infections. Results. Eighty-three patients received CTI during the study period. Most patients (98%) had refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Infections occurred in 54% of patients in the 90 days before CTI (infection density, 1.23) and in 40% of patients in the first 28 days following CTI (infection density, 2.89). Infection density decreased to 0.55 in the 29-90 days post-CTI. Most infections were bacteremias (39%) or respiratory viral infections (43%). Pre-CTI risk factors associated with infection included prior hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), immunoglobulin G (IgG) level <400 mg/dL, and lymphodepletion other than cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine; post-CTI risk factors included higher-severity CRS and IgG <400 mg/dL. Conclusions. Infection rates in children and young adults receiving CD19 CAR T-cell therapy increase in the first month and then decline. Understanding types and timing of infections and contributing risk factors may help inform prophylactic and monitoring strategies. Specific attention should be given to patients with prior HCT, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, and severe CRS.
e1e63a4d4a200579e6279066dc5cd9cc6a8600d0	Background: Tocilizumab was approved for chimeric antigen receptor TÀcell therapy induced cytokine release syndrome and it may provide clinical benefit for selected COVIDÀ19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed hypoxic COVIDÀ19 patients who were consecutively admitted between March 13, 2020 and April 19, 2020. Patients with lung infiltrates and elevated inflammatory markers received a single dose of tocilizumab if no contraindication was present. Systemic steroid, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin were concomitantly used for majority of the patients. Findings: Of the 51 patients included for analysis, 28 (55%) received tocilizumab and 23 (45%) did not receive tocilizumab. Tocilizumab cohort required more invasive ventilation (68% vs. 22%) at baseline and during entire hospitalization (75% vs. 48%). The median time to clinical improvement in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts was 8 days (Interquartile range [IQR]: 6¢25 À 9¢75 days) vs. 13 days (IQR: 9¢75 À 15¢25 days) among patients who required mechanical ventilation at any time (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 1¢83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0¢57 À 5¢84) and 6¢5 days vs. 7 days among all patients (Hazard ratio for clinical improvement: 1¢14, 95% CI: 0¢55 À 2¢38), respectively. The median duration of vasopressor support and invasive mechanical ventilation were 2 days (IQR: 1¢75 À 4¢25 days) vs. 5 days (IQR: 4 À 8 days), p = 0.039, and 7 days (IQR: 4 À 14 days) vs. 10 days (IQR: 5 À 15 days) in tocilizumab vs. no tocilizumab cohorts, p = 0.11, respectively. Similar rates of hospitalÀacquired infections occurred in both cohorts (18% in tocilizumab and 22% in no tocilizumab cohort). Interpretation: In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with significantly shorter duration of vasopressor support. Although not statistically significant, tocilizumab also resulted in shorter median time to clinical improvement and shorter duration of invasive ventilation. These findings require validation from ongoing clinical trials of Tocilizumab in COVIDÀ19 patients.
85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of mortality driven by infectious 28 agents. RNA viruses such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the new pandemic 29 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can be highly pathogenic. Clinical and experimental evidence indicate 30 that most severe and lethal cases do not depend on the viral burden and are, instead, 31 characterized by an aberrant immune response. In this work we assessed how the innate immune 32 response contributes to the pathogenesis of RNA virus infections. We demonstrate that type III 33 interferons produced by dendritic cells in the lung in response to viral recognition cause barrier 34 damage and compromise the host tissue tolerance. In particular, type III interferons inhibit tissue 35 repair and lung epithelial cell proliferation, causing susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections. 36 Overall, our data give a strong mandate to rethink the pathophysiological roles of this group of 37 interferons and their possible use in the clinical practice against endemic as well as emerging 38 viral infections. 39 40 41 3 Main text. 42 The ability to resolve viral infections of the lung is dependent on the actions of interferons (IFNs) 43 and inflammatory cytokines. These molecules are induced during viral infections, yet the relative 44 contributions of each interferon or cytokine to host defense and a return to homeostasis remains 45 undefined. In particular the actions of type III IFNs (IFN-λ) have attracted much attention, as 46 these cytokines operate primarily at mucosal surfaces, in part due to the selective expression of 47 the type III IFN receptor in epithelia and neutrophils (1-3). Recent work established that unlike 48 their type I or II counterparts, type III IFN signaling induces antiviral activities while simultaneously 49 minimizing the tissue destructive activity of neutrophils (4-6). When considered in the context of 50 an increasing number of viral infections, including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory 51 syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2, where inflammation appears to be the primary driver of 52 life threatening symptoms (7-12) , the ability of type III IFNs to limit immunopathology but maintain 53 antiviral activity is significant. Indeed, discussions on the possible use of IFN-λ against SARS-54 COV-2 have begun (13) and a clinical trial (14) has been initiated with the human pegylated-IFN-55 λ1a. Despite this interest of the use of type III IFNs to treat viral infections, we know very little 56 about the short-and long-term actions of this family of secreted factors. 57 During viral infections of the lung, immunopathology may predispose the host to opportunistic 58 bacterial infections, referred to as superinfections, which take advantage of this unbalanced status 59 and often lead to lethal consequences (15-17). In contrast to its protective effect against acute 60 viral infections, IFN-λ was found to decrease bacterial control in virus-bacteria superinfection 61 models(18-20) . Whether this is due to the anti-inflammatory activity of IFN-λ that results in a 62 reduced resistance of the host to a subsequent bacterial infection or to the capacity of this group 63 of interferons to alter the physiology of the lung upon a viral encounter remains unresolved. As 64 of present the contribution of type III IFN to the human pathology of severe viral infections and 65 bacterial superinfections is unknown. Superinfections represent the first cause of lethality upon 66 influenza virus infection (21) and correlate with severity in coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 67 4 patients (11, 22-24). Mouse models of SARS, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (25, 26) 68 and influenza (5, 27-29) are characterized by a robust induction of IFN-λ, however, the 69 involvement of this group of interferons in COVID-19 is more controversial. Although in vitro 70 studies on nasal and bronchial primary epithelial cells demonstrate IFN-λ induction by SARS-71 CoV-2 (30), another study found a reduced production of both type I and type III IFNs in vitro and 72 ex vivo (31). 73 To directly evaluate the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to induce interferons in the upper or 74 lower airways, we tested the presence of IFNs, and other inflammatory cytokines, in the swabs 75 of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, as well as the bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid of severe 76 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Although we confirmed that COVID-19 patients present a scarce 77 production of inflammatory mediators in the upper airways, the BAL fluid of patients with severe 78 disease presented elevated levels not only of inflammatory cytokines, but also of specific 79 members of the type III IFN family (Fig. 1A-E) . Thus, IFN-λ production is associated with the most 80 pathogenic endemic as well as emerging RNA viral infections. 81 In order to directly evaluate the contribution of IFN-λ to the immune pathology driven by 82 RNA respiratory viruses uncoupled from its effect on viral replication, we devised an experimental 83 system in which pattern recognition receptors (PRR) involved in viral sensing were stimulated 84 with their cognate ligands in mice that can, or cannot, respond to IFN-λ. RNA viruses are directly 85 sensed by two major classes of PRR (32, 33) . Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize viral nucleic 86 acids in the endosomal compartment with TLR7 recognizing single-stranded RNA directly from 87

As these applications evolve and mature, it is evident that many of these applications must address similar requirements, such as policies, security and flexibility. It is important a software architecture is created to meet these requirements. We outline the requirements for a public health surveillance application, and define a set of common components to address these requirements. These components are configured to produce services used in the development of public health applications. Results: A layered software architecture, the ALPHA architecture, has been developed to support the development of public health applications. The architecture has been used to build eleven surveillance applications for the Public Health Agency of Canada in the areas of disease surveillance, survey, distributed data collection and inventory management. We have found that a software architecture that addresses requirements on policies, security and flexibility facilitates the development of configurable public health applications. By creating this architecture, key success factors, such as reducing cost and time-to-market of applications, adapting to changing surveillance targets and increasing user efficiency are achieved.

5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	Objective The clinical characteristics and chest imaging findings of viral pneumonia and several interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) overlap, and viral pneumonia may be underrecognized and misdiagnosed as certain ILDs. To clarify the frequency of viral pneumonia among patients with acute progressive clinical courses that required a differential diagnosis between ILDs and pneumonia, and to determine the most frequent ILDs misdiagnosed in cases of viral pneumonia. We retrospectively analyzed patients hospitalized from 2010 to 2017 with an acute clinical course (! 30 days) who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the differential diagnosis of infection and ILDs. We performed a multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses using the patients' preserved BAL fluid. The final diagnosis was made by a multidisciplinary approach and after considering the PCR results. The diagnosis at discharge was compared to the final diagnosis. Results Among the 109 patients, 53 were diagnosed with viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia and other diseases showed some differences in symptoms and laboratory data; however, the differences were small or overlapped. Viral pneumonia was misdiagnosed on discharge as acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (AFOP/COP/CEP) (n=22), acute interstitial pneumonia (n=5), connective tissue disease-related ILDs (n=3), unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia (n=2), drug-induced ILD (n=1), and pneumonia (n=20). Conclusion Approximately half of the patients who underwent BAL had viral pneumonia. The most common ILD-related misdiagnoses were AFOP/COP/CEP. Differences in symptoms and laboratory findings between viral pneumonia and other diseases were small, and viral pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis when physicians encounter cases in which the abovementioned ILDs are suspected.

93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	Structural HDV domains, amino acid motifs, and post-translational modifications of HDAg regulate the processes of HDV transcription, nuclear localization and export, and replication. RNA-editing of the amber stop codon of the antigenomic strand leads to L-HDAg mRNA transcription. L-HDAg acts mainly as an inhibitor of certain stages of HDV RNA replication and is required for virion assembly and attachment to HBV envelope proteins (1) . Farnesylation of the C-terminus Cys-211 is a crucial modification required for incorporating HDV particles into HBV envelope proteins (2) . Recent experimental evidence demonstrates that HDV infectious particles can be produced using envelope proteins from viruses other than HBV (3) . However, farnesylation of the L-HDAg C-terminus is a requirement. As with the recently described snake deltavirus, duck-associated, and other vertebrate and invertebrate deltavirus sequences (4-6) , the rodent deltavirus (RDeV) ORF does not encode the CXXQ C-terminal motif required for packaging. Genomic and antigenomic HDV RNA replication takes place in the nucleus, with genomic HDV RNA and mRNA synthesized in nuclear bodies, and antigenomic HDV RNA replicated in the nucleolus (7, 8) . S-HDAg employs DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) for genomic HDV RNA replication by functionally interacting with its clamp formation, forcing it to use an RNA instead of a DNA template (9, 10) . HDV RNA genomes are replicated under a double rolling-circle replication scheme, forming multimers that are later self-cleaved by ribozyme structures (11-13) . Two ribozyme regions self-cleave the genomic and the antigenomic human HDV RNA respectively (14) . SI Appendix Fig. S4 shows the HDV ribozyme structures together with predicted ribozyme structures for the rodent deltavirus. The coiled-coil domain at the N-terminal HDAg is responsible for the formation of dimers/multimers as well as for activating/promoting and inhibiting RNA replication (15, 16) . The HDV nuclear localization signal (NLS) is located between residues 66-75 on the S-HDAg with the conserved amino acid domains 66-EGAPPAKRAR-75 (17) . Essential for the nuclear import are the acidic glutamic acid residue at position 66 and the basic arginine residue at position 75 (17) . S-RDeAg shows a slightly different NLS composition, although presenting an acidic aspartic acid residue at position 66 and a basic arginine residue at position 74. Pro-205 of the L-HDAg is critical for the nuclear export signal's (NES) functionality, which directs L-HDAg to the cytoplasm via a chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-independent pathway, a transport factor found at nuclear pores (18, 19) . However, nuclear export of genomic HDV RNA is independent of L-HDAg and because genomic HDV RNA is synthesized by Pol-II, it has been speculated that it may be exported by the same mechanism as for splicing-dependent cellular mRNAs (18) . S-HDAg is an essential activator for HDV RNA replication and undergoes the following modifications: i) Arg-13 methylation, ii) Lys-72 acetylation, iii) Ser-177 phosphorylation, iv) sumoylation of several Lysine residues. Methylation at Arg-13 is essential for translocating S-HDAg to the nucleus and for antigenomic RNA replication (20, 21) . Experimental evidence shows this site to be involved in transporting the antigenomic RNA into the nucleus (21) . Non-methylated S-HDAg mediates the nuclear transport of genomic HDV RNA (21) . The nuclear transport of HDAg is also mediated by Lys-72 acetylation (22) . Lys-72 acetylation additionally regulates the synthesis of the different HDV RNA species, enhancing genomic HDV RNA and mRNA replication (23) . Very recently, experimental evidence showed that acetylation

We propose a method that incorporates simple semantics into TDT by splitting the term space into groups of terms that have the meaning of the same type. Such a group can be associated with an external ontology. This ontology is used to determine the similarity of two terms in the given group. We extract proper names, locations, temporal expressions and normal terms into distinct sub-vectors of the document representation. Measuring the similarity of two documents is conducted by comparing a pair of their corresponding sub-vectors at a time. We use a simple perceptron to optimize the relative emphasis of each semantic class in the tracking and detection decisions. The results suggest that the spatial and the temporal similarity measures need to be improved. Especially the vagueness of spatial and temporal terms needs to be addressed.

9bad9c5864165815b35dd2c78cd0ed7b285f0517	This paper analyzes the main trend of the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) vaccines in recent years. Designing an HIV-1 vaccine that provides robust protection from HIV-1 infection remains a challenge despite many years of effort. Therefore, we describe the receptor binding domain of gp120 as a target for developing AIDS vaccines. And we recommend some measures that could induce efficiently and produce cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies with high binding affinity. Those measures may offer a new way of the research and development of the potent and broad AIDS vaccines.

ef17f33bbdbe5b6ba517f066befe5b399744b47d	With the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China, in January 2020, the escalating number of confirmed and suspected cases overwhelmed the admission capacity of the designated hospitals. Two specialty field hospitals-Huoshenshan and Leishenshan-were designed, built and commissioned in record time (9-12 days) to address the outbreak. This study documents the design and construction of Leishenshan Hospital. Based on data collected from various sources such as the semi-structured interviews of key stakeholders from Leishenshan Hospital, this study found that adhering to a product, organization, and process (POP) modeling approach combined with building information modeling (BIM) allowed for the ultra-rapid creation, management, and communication of project-related information, resulting in the successful development of this fully functional, state-of-the-art infectious disease specialty hospital. With the unfortunate ongoing international COVID-19 outbreak, many countries and regions face similar hospital capacity problems. It is thus expected that the lessons learned from the design, construction and commissioning of Leishenshan Hospital can provide a valuable reference to the development of specialty field hospitals in other countries and regions.
cb676ff025c22858a5c98adf8c6196a5f99f39c9	With rapid advances in technologies, especially in artificial intelligence, smart sensors, big data analytics, and robotics, the service industry began introducing robots to perform a variety of functions. While the main purpose of deploying robots has been productivity improvement, the current COVID-19 pandemic has brought more urgent purpose, providing contactless service for social distancing. This study explores the service quality provided by robots based on real data in a hotel setting. A sample of 201 guests provided their expected service quality by robots and the actual performance experience after the service. We analyzed this relationship using importance performance analysis (IPA) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The results revealed that customers' top priorities for robots' service quality are assurance and reliability, while tangible and empathy were not as important. Customers were not satisfied with robots' responsiveness, but this construct was found to be a low priority.
40814daa0a6652bbe89c5f4c09aa783c04014cf8	Foster parents are crucial to the function of the child welfare system. Despite developments in research related to the grief and loss of foster parents, more research would be helpful in building a stronger understanding and knowledge base for helping foster parents manage the removals of foster children in their home. This study included ten foster parents from the United States and explored their experience with loss and the stress associated with the expected or unexpected removal of a foster child from their home. The findings of the data analysis yielded three overarching themes: (1) managing or coping with ambiguous loss; (2) systemic impacts of a move or removal on a family; (3) need for helpful preparation or support for dealing with the loss of foster child. Implications include better preparation and support for foster parents dealing with moves and removals of foster children, as well as considering less abrupt removals of children from foster homes.
7416c523189beff122c97c6d554e3c63a1b5aed2	The COVID-19 pandemic is straining public health systems worldwide and major non-35 pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to slow its spread 1-4 . During the initial phase 36 of the outbreak the spread was primarily determined by human mobility 5,6 . Yet empirical evidence 37 on the effect of key geographic factors on local epidemic spread is lacking 7 . We analyse highly-38 resolved spatial variables for cities in China together with case count data in order to investigate 39 the role of climate, urbanization, and variation in interventions across China. Here we show that 40 the epidemic intensity of COVID-19 is strongly shaped by crowding, such that epidemics in dense 41 cities are more spread out through time, and denser cities have larger total incidence. Observed 42 differences in epidemic intensity are well captured by a metapopulation model of COVID-19 that 43 explicitly accounts for spatial hierarchies. Densely-populated cities worldwide may experience more 44 prolonged epidemics. Whilst stringent interventions can shorten the time length of these local 45 epidemics, although these may be difficult to implement in many affected settings. 46 47 Main text 63 China provides richly detailed epidemiological time series 2,17,18 across a wide range of geographic 64 contexts, hence the epidemic there provides an opportunity to evaluate the role of factors in shaping the

87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	Rabies remains a major public health concern in many developing countries. The precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown, though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction. Mice that received intranasal inoculation of an attenuated rabies virus (RABV) strain HEP-Flury exhibited subtle clinical signs, and eventually recovered, which is different from the fatal encephalitis caused by the virulent RABV strain CVS-11. To understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance, we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. HEP-Flury or CVS-11 intranasally inoculated mice. Our results revealed that both RABV strains altered positively and negatively the expression levels of many host genes, including genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation and cell death. It is found that HEP-Flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, and the innate immunity pre-activated by HEP-Flury or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection can effectively prevent the CVS-11 to invade central nervous system (CNS), but fails to clear the CVS-11 after its entry into the CNS. In addition, following CVS-11 infection, genes implicated in cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up-regulated, while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down-regulated. On the other hand, several genes involved in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the HEP-Flury infection as compared with the CVS-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of CD4 + T cells and MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated RABV from the CNS. The differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post-exposure treatment window for RABV infection.
a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	Infectious diseases are an important cause of human death. The study of the pathogenesis, spread regularity, and development trend of infectious diseases not only provides a theoretical basis for future research on infectious diseases, but also has practical guiding significance for the prevention and control of their spread. In this paper, a controlled differential equation and an objective function of infectious diseases were established by mathematical modeling. Based on cellular automata theory and a compartmental model, the SLIRDS (Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible) model was constructed, a model which can better reflect the actual infectious process of infectious diseases. Considering the spread of disease in different populations, the model combines population density, sex ratio, and age structure to set the evolution rules of the model. Finally, on the basis of the SLIRDS model, the complex spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was simulated. The simulation results are similar to the macroscopic characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in real life, thus the accuracy and rationality of the SLIRDS model are confirmed.
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	Plant artificial micro-RNAs (amiRs) have been engineered to target viral genomes and induce their degradation. However, the exceptional evolutionary plasticity of RNA viruses threatens the durability of the resistance conferred by these amiRs. It has recently been shown that viral populations not experiencing strong selective pressure from an antiviral amiR may already contain enough genetic variability in the target sequence to escape plant resistance in an almost deterministic manner. Furthermore, it has also been shown that viral populations exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of the antiviral amiR speed up this process. In this article, we have characterized the molecular evolutionary dynamics of an amiR target sequence in a viral genome under both conditions. The use of Illumina ultradeep sequencing has allowed us to identify virus sequence variants at frequencies as low as 2 Â 10 À6 and to track their variation in time before and after the viral population was able of successfully infecting plants fully resistant to the ancestral virus. We found that every site in the amiR-target sequence of the viral genome presented variation and that the variant that eventually broke resistance was sampled among the many coexisting ones. In this system, viral evolution in fully susceptible plants results from an equilibrium between mutation and genetic drift, whereas evolution in partially resistant plants originates from more complex dynamics involving mutation, selection, and drift.
51fcc2884bf01279f7d643c9dd1915b3d47f3929	Influenza A viruses cause annual epidemics and irregular pandemics. A vaccine with heterosubtypic protection (hetero-protection) has been needed. In the present study, various influenza H1, H3, H5, and H9 hemagglutinin (HA) proteins were expressed in insect cells, and then mice were subcutaneously immunized with the expressed HA proteins, and challenged by influenza A viruses (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) or A/chicken/Guangdong/96 (H9N2)). The results first showed that wild-type H3 hemagglutinin (HA) (H3-WT), but not a transmembrane domain (TM) mutant, had hetero-protection against both H1N1 and H9N2 with survival rates of 17% and 33% respectively, and that wild-type H1 (H1-WT), H5 (H5-WT) and H9 (H9-WT) had no hetero-protection against H1N1 or H9N2 except for H5-WT against H1N1 with a survival rate of 17%. Then the H3-WT TM replaced the TMs of H1-WT, H5-WT and H9-WT to generate recombinant H1-TM, H5-TM and H9-TM respectively, and whether the H3-WT TM-dependent heteroprotection could be transferred to these TM mutants was investigated. The results showed that the H3-WT TM-dependent hetero-protection was transferable. H1-TM against H9N2 and H9-TM against H1N1 were with survival rates of 33% and 17% respectively, and H5-TM against both H1N1 and H9N2 with survival rates of 50% and 17% respectively. Furthermore, higher dosage H5-TM scored 100% hetero-protection against H1N1. These results demonstrated that replacement of the TMs of non-H3 HAs with H3-WT TM could enhance their hetero-protection. These findings would help the development of future influenza vaccines against pandemics such as the recently appeared H7N9 infection.
379b306405782e794cb4f158ed79b856bc5d2672	The COVID-19 pandemic (that started in early 2020) is causing several disruptions in the short-and mid-term, to which businesses have to adapt. Some retailers have reacted to the emergency immediately, displaying a plethora of different intervention types. The authors aim to synthesize the challenges that retailers are facing during the COVID-19 emergency. We do this from the perspective of both consumers and managers, with the goal of providing guidelines on and examples of how retailers can handle this unprecedented situation.
47998ce47866b5151aea13d028c6f8e32936c96d	objective To investigate the relationship between avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) and corticosteroid treatment given to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). methods Longitudinal study of 71 former SARS patients (mainly health care workers) who had been treated with corticosteroids, with an observation time of 36 months. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) and X-rays of hips, knees, shoulders, ankles and wrists were taken as part of the post-SARS follow-up assessments. results Thirty-nine per cent developed AVN of the hips within 3-4 months after starting treatment. Two more cases of hip necrosis were seen after 1 year and another 11 cases of AVN were diagnosed after 3 years, one with hip necrosis and 10 with necrosis in other joints. In total, 58% of the cohort had developed AVN after 3 years of observation. The sole factor explaining AVN in the hip was the total dose of corticosteroids received. conclusion The use of corticosteroids in SARS has been debated; opinions conflict about whether the immediate benefits in terms of saving lives compensate for the adverse effects, including AVN.
55977712092b4e2ac6c4d152ce67df2ca7870a72	Uniform interpolants were largely studied in non-classical propositional logics since the nineties, and their connection to model completeness was pointed out in the literature. A successive parallel research line inside the automated reasoning community investigated uniform quantifier-free interpolants (sometimes referred to as "covers") in first-order theories. In this paper, we investigate cover transfer to theory combinations in the disjoint signatures case. We prove that, for convex theories, cover algorithms can be transferred to theory combinations under the same hypothesis needed to transfer quantifier-free interpolation (i.e., the equality interpolating property, aka strong amalgamation property). The key feature of our algorithm relies on the extensive usage of the Beth definability property for primitive fragments to convert implicitly defined variables into their explicitly defining terms. In the non-convex case, we show by a counterexample that cover may not exist in the combined theories, even in case combined quantifier-free interpolants do exist.
e2045bdfd74eefda85d073b04cdd5739eae93691	Purpose: As an important measure to alleviate long-term care (LTC) costs for the disabled due to the aging of the population, long-term care insurance (LTCI) system has been paid more attention in China. In addition to the government-led public LTCI system that has been piloted in cities such as Qingdao, Chongqing and Shanghai, health insurers such as the China Life Insurance Company are also experimenting with various types of commercial LTCI in the private market. However, the commercial LTCI market is developing very slowly due to public awareness and other reasons. On the other hand, COVID-2019 has had an impact on the cognition of the importance of long-term care for the elderly due to the fact that the death cases of COVID-2019 have been mainly concentrated in the elderly population with chronic diseases such as hypertension. Therefore, the

Here, we review current knowledge of infl uenza viruses, their life cycle, interspecies transmission, and past pandemics and discuss the molecular basis of pandemic acquisition, notably of hemagglutinin (lectin) acting as a key contributor to change in host specifi city in viral infection.
997fc48311d9bcdf4098cff2accf702f27f3d989	Background: The response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has required conserving capacity and resources to avoid the health sector being overwhelmed. This paper describes Geelong's general surgical response, surgical activity, outcomes and the effect on surgical training. Methods: Data collected from surgical audits; hospital databases and patient's medical records were used to compare the first 7 weeks of our new service delivery (All surgical cases, morbidity and mortality were discussed at weekly surgical audit meetings conducted by videoconference. Treatment performance indicators were tested by chisquared test for proportions, and by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. Results: Elective general surgery decreased by 45.9% but an essential service was maintained by substantially increasing our public in private operating to perform 81 cases. Despite a 30% decrease in emergency department presentations, general surgery admissions decreased only 6.1% while emergency operations increased 13.9%. We used telehealth to conduct 81.3% of outpatient appointments and 61.8% of pre-operative anaesthetic reviews. No significant differences were found for overall surgical outcomes, including appendicectomy (perforation rates) and laparotomy (length of stay and morbidity). Operative exposure for trainees was maintained. Conclusion: Geelong was able to provide a safe and effective general surgery service during the first 7 weeks of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. There are some valuable lessons which could be adopted elsewhere in the event of a surge or second wave of cases. © 2020 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons ANZ J Surg (2020) ANZJSurg.com
9469e473aa6b43662d6b219af4b8ce4dc3b265c6	Data visualization is an important tool for exploring and communicating findings in medical research, and specially in epidemiological surveillance. The COVID19-Tracker app systematically produces daily updated data visualization and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain. It collects automatically daily data on COVID-19 diagnosed cases, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality, from February 24 th , 2020 onwards. Two applications have already been developed; 1) to analyze data trends and estimating short-term projections; and 2) To assess the effect of the lockdown on the trend of incident data. We are currently planning to improve the app by uploading shortly new applications for data visualization and analysis, which may help for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic data in Spain.
9dec2d98cff04a86a066196d1833dcd80879d151	Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulphate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulphate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulphated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulphate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.

e24d82d4595bf22a6f5267d83fc409cd6ceaf42f	This paper introduces Time Series Regression (TSR): a little-studied task of which the aim is to learn the relationship between a time series and a continuous target variable. In contrast to time series classification (TSC), which predicts a categorical class label, TSR predicts a numerical value. This task generalizes forecasting, relaxing the requirement that the value predicted be a future value of the input series or primarily depend on more recent values. In this paper, we motivate and introduce this task, and benchmark possible solutions to tackling it on a novel archive of 19 TSR datasets which we have assembled. Our results show that the state-of-the-art TSC model Rocket, when adapted for regression, performs the best overall compared to other TSC models and state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models such as XGBoost, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression. More importantly, we show that much research is needed in this field to improve the accuracy of ML models.

In under 7 weeks, we enrolled a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-recovered participants, developed neutralization assays to interrogate serum and monoclonal antibody responses, adapted our high throughput antibody isolation, production and characterization pipeline to rapidly screen over 1000 antigen-specific antibodies, and established an animal model to test protection. We report multiple highly potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and show that passive transfer of a nAb provides protection against highdose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian hamsters. The study suggests a role for nAbs in prophylaxis, and potentially therapy, of COVID-19. The nAbs define protective epitopes to guide vaccine design.

Prioritization of medical countermeasures for evaluation in randomized 46 clinical trials is critically hindered by the lack of COVID-19 animal models that 47 enable accurate, quantifiable, and reproducible measurement of COVID-19 48 pulmonary disease free from observer bias. We first used serial computed 49 tomography (CT) to demonstrate that bilateral intrabronchial instillation of SARS-50 CoV-2 into crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) results in mild-to-moderate 51 lung abnormalities qualitatively characteristic of subclinical or mild-to-moderate 52 COVID-19 (e.g., ground-glass opacities with or without reticulation, paving, or 53 alveolar consolidation, peri-bronchial thickening, linear opacities) at typical 54 locations (peripheral>central, posterior and dependent, bilateral, multi-lobar). We 55 then used positron emission tomography (PET) analysis to demonstrate increased 56 FDG uptake in the CT-defined lung abnormalities and regional lymph nodes. 57 PET/CT imaging findings appeared in all macaques as early as 2 days post-58 exposure, variably progressed, and subsequently resolved by 6-12 days post-59 exposure. Finally, we applied operator-independent, semi-automatic quantification 60 of the volume and radiodensity of CT abnormalities as a possible primary endpoint 61 for immediate and objective efficacy testing of candidate medical countermeasures. 62 63
eb75b255e56960c472d2d13c3b23d5b392e95253	The increased demand for online services of spatial information poses new challenges to the combined filed of Computer Science and Geographic Information Science. Amongst others, these include fast indexing of spatial data in distributed networks. In this paper we propose a novel semantic overlay network for large-scale multi-dimensional spatial information indexing, called SON_LSII, which has a hybrid structure integrating a semantic quad-tree and Chord ring. The SON_LSII is a small world overlay network that achieves a very competitive trade-off between indexing efficiency and maintenance overhead. To create SON_LSII, we use an effective semantic clustering strategy that considers two aspects, i.e., the semantic of spatial information that peer holds in overlay network and physical network performances. Based on SON_LSII, a mapping method is used to reduce the multi-dimensional features into a single dimension and an efficient indexing algorithm is presented to support complex range queries of the spatial information with a massive number of concurrent users. The results from extensive experiments demonstrate that SON_LSII is superior to existing overlay networks in various respects, including scalability, maintenance, rate of indexing hits, indexing logical hops, and adaptability. Thus, the proposed SON_LSII can be used for large-scale spatial information indexing.
251136fc97e9c78c94f9dea6093cc5511e3c46dc	A model describing the dynamics related to the spreading of non-lethal infectious diseases in a fixed-size population is proposed. The model consists of a non-linear delay-differential equation describing the time evolution of the increment in the number of infectious individuals and depends upon a limited number of parameters. Predictions are in good qualitative agreement with data on influenza, which is taken to be a representative type of non-lethal infectious disease. The European Physical Journal B
3a6935631f66d18934640a27e316f6b7a4b1ed94	The coronavirus has affected billions of people worldwide. As of early June, estimates of infections exceeded six million individuals, about double the number from early May. The United States has experienced more cases than Spain, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Canada, Japan, and Russia combined. To make things worse, the structure of the U.S. health-care system may significantly impede access to needed medical services while exposing patients to financial liabilities. One particularly concerning feature may be the limitations on access imposed by provider networks. This article briefly reviews what we know about the narrowing of provider networks, and how findings from a series of recent articles illustrating the often-severe restrictions imposed by these networks may be particularly detrimental in the middle of a global health emergency. I also highlight how the actions taken by policymakers to temporarily mitigate these problems have fallen short and what potential long-term solutions might look like.
7270d1edf2f31f3eefd3130ff8a97ff6840e3248	Purpose Deferring cancer surgery can have profound adverse effects including patient mortality. During the COVID-19 pandemic, departmental reorganisation and adherence to evolving guidelines enabled provision of uninterrupted surgical care to patients with bone and soft tissue tumours (BST) in need of surgery. We reviewed the outcomes of surgeries on BST during the first two months of the pandemic at one of the tertiary BST centres in the UK. Materials and methods Between 12 March 2020 and 12 May 2020, 56 patients of a median age of 57 years (18-87) underwent surgery across two sites: index hospital (n = 27) and COVID-free facility (n = 29). Twenty-five (44.6%) patients were above the age of 60 years and 20 (35.7%) patients were in ASA III and ASA IV category. The decision to offer surgery was made in adherence with the guidelines issued by the NHS, BOOS and BSG. Results At a minimum follow-up of 30 days post-surgery, 54 (96.4%) patients were recovering well. Thirteen patients (23.2%) had post-operative complications which included four (7.1%) patients developing pulmonary embolism. The majority of complications (12/13 = 92.7%) occurred in ASA III and IV category patients. Four (7.1%) patients contracted COVID-19, of which three required escalation of care due to pulmonary complications and two (3.6%) died. Patients < 60 years of age had significantly less complications than those > 60 years (p < 0.001). Patients operated on in the COVID-free facility had fewer complications compared with those operated on at the index hospital (p < 0.027). Conclusion In spite of the favourable results in majority of our patients, our study shows that patients with sarcoma operated at the height of the pandemic are at a risk of contracting COVID-19 and also having associated with mortality. The use of a COVIDfree facility, surgery in patients < 60 60 years and in ASA I & II category are associated with better outcomes. If a second wave occurs, a serious consideration should be given to ways of minimising the risk of contracting COVID-19 in these vulnerable patients either by using COVID-free facilities or delaying treatment until peak of infection has passed.
97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5	Vaccines suffice for protecting public health against seasonal influenza viruses, but when unexpected strains appear against which the vaccine does not confer protection, alternative treatments are necessary. In this work, we used gene expression and virus growth data from influenza-infected mice to determine how moderate and deadly influenza viruses may invoke unique inflammatory responses and the role these responses play in disease pathology. We found that the relationship between virus growth and the inflammatory response for all viruses tested can be characterized by ultrasensitive response in which the inflammatory response is gated until a threshold concentration of virus is exceeded in the lung after which strong inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production occurs. This finding challenges the notion that deadly influenza viruses invoke unique cytokine and inflammatory responses and provides additional evidence that pathology is regulated by virus load, albeit in a highly nonlinear fashion. These findings suggests immunomodulatory treatments could focus on altering inflammatory response dynamics to improve disease pathology.

9e1636fb626b72f4ba9eff80a9cec3b97f8de8c6	Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a common and robust tool for accurate quantiÞcation of mRNA transcripts. To normalize results, a housekeeping gene ([HKG], reference gene or endogenous control gene) is mandatory. Soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a signiÞcant soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., pest, yet gene expression and functional genomics studies are hindered by a lack of stable HKGs. We evaluated seven potential HKGs (SDFS, succinate dehydrogenase ßavoprotein subunit; EF1a, elongation factor-1␣; HEL, helicase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase; RPS9, ribosomal protein S9; TBP, TATA-box binding protein; and UBQ, ubiquitin-conjugating protein) to determine the most efÞcient HKGs that have stable expression among tissues, developmental stages, and aphids fed on susceptible and host plantÐresistant soybean. HKG stability was determined using GeNorm and NormFinder. Results from three different experimental conditions revealed high stability of TBP compared with the other HKGs proÞled across the samples assayed. RPS9 showed stable expression among aphids on susceptible and resistant plants, whereas EF1a showed stable expression in tissues and developmental stages. Therefore, we recommend the TBP as a suitable HKG for efÞcient normalization among treatments, tissues, and developmental stages of A. glycines. In addition, RPS9 may be used for host-plant resistance experiments and EF1a could be considered for testing differential expression across tissues or developmental stages. These results will enable a more accurate and reliable normalization of qRT-PCR data in A. glycines.
da46461bf7e0abd61a5ff6dfd132bdb91211d187	All study cases were grouped according to whether they had a history of hypertension. Then, a subgroup analysis for all hypertensive patients was carried out based on whether to take ACEI or ARB drugs. The mean age of 110 patients was 57.7 years (range, 25-86 years), of which 60 (54.5%) were male patients. The main underlying diseases included hypertension [36 (32.7%)] and diabetes [11 (10.0%)]. Compared with the non-hypertensive group, the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the hypertensive group (average value, 0.96 × 10 9 /L vs 1.26 × 10 9 /L), and analysis of clinical outcomes showed that the crude mortality rate was higher in the hypertensive group [7/36 (19.4%) vs 2/74 (2.7%)]. Patients treated with ACEI or ARB, compared with the control group, were younger (average age, 58.5 years vs 69.2 years), but there was no statistical difference in the crude cure rate [10/15 (66.7%) vs 15/21 (71.4%)] and the crude mortality rate [2/15 (13.3%) vs 5/21 (23.8%)]. In conclusions, the COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had a significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission. The elderly and comorbidities such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Taking ACEI or ARB drugs may not change the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. ARTICLE HISTORY
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	We develop an automatic control system to help to design efficient mitigation measures for the Covid-19 epidemic in cities. Taking into account parameters associated to the population of each city and the mobility among them, the optimal control framework suggests the level and duration of protective measures that must be implemented to ensure that the number of infected individuals is within a range that avoids the collapse of the health care system. Compared against other mitigation measures that are implemented simultaneously and in equal strength across cities our method has three major particularities when: Accounts for city commute and health infrastructure: It takes into account the daily commute among cities to estimate the dynamics of infected people while keeping the number of infected people within a desired level at each city avoiding the collapse of its health care system. City-specific control: It allows for orchestrating the control measures among cities so as to prevent all cities to face the same level control. The model tends to induce alternation between periods of stricter controls and periods of a more normal life in each city and among the cities. Flexible scenarios: It is flexible enough to allow for simulating the impact of particular actions. For example, one can simulate the how the control all cities change when the number of care beds increases in specific places. Therefore, our method creates an automatic dance adjusting mitigation levels within cities and alternating among cities as suggested in [9] . This automatic dance may help the city economy and orchestration of resources. We provide case studies using the major cities of the state of São Paulo given by using estimates on the daily mobility among the cities their health care system capacity. We use official data in our case studies. However, sub-notification of infected people in Brazil is notoriously high. Hence the case study should not be considered as a real world policy suggestion. It high sub-notification is taken into account, the optimal control algorithm will suggest stricter mitigation measures, as also shown in the case studies. Surprisingly, the total duration of the protocol for the state is barely affected by the subnotification, but the severity of such protocols is strengthened. This stresses a twofold implication, first, the protocol depends on high-quality data and, second, such optimal and orchestrated protocol is robust and can be adjusted to the demand.
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus discovered in December 2019 and closely related to the SARS coronavirus (CoV). Both viruses use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry, recognizing it with the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral spike (S) protein. The S2 domain mediates viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Experience with SARS and MERS coronavirus has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against the RBD can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor (ACE2 for SARS) and block the virus cell entry. Assuming that a similar strategy would be successful against SARS-CoV-2, we used phage display to select from the human naïve universal antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 anti SARS2 spike antibodies capable of inhibiting interaction with ACE2. 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1 were identified. 17 showed more than 75% inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2, assessed by flow cytometry and several antibodies showed even an 50% inhibition at a molar ratio of the antibody to spike protein or RBD of 1:1. Furthermore, these antibodies neutralized active SARS-Cov-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells. All 17 were all able to bind the isolated RBD, four of them with sub-nanomolar EC50. Epitope analysis of the antibodies revealed that six bind at the RBD-ACE2 interface and two on the opposite side of the domain. Universal libraries from healthy donors offer the advantage that antibodies can be generated quickly and independent from the availability of material from recovered patients in a pandemic situation. 4/34 In 2015 Menachery et al. wrote: "Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV reemergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations." 1 . Four years later, a novel coronavirus causing a severe pneumonia was discovered and later named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak started on a sea food market in Wuhan, Hubei province (China) at the end of 2019. The disease was named COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Sequencing showed high identity to bat corona viruses (CoV, in particular RaTG13), beta-CoV virus causing human diseases like SARS and MERS and, to a lesser extent, the seasonal CoV hCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 2,3 . The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV, binds to the human zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is expressed on lung cells, heart, kidney and intestine cells and acts as receptor for virus entry. S protein consists of the N-terminal S1 subunit, which includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), and the Cterminal S2 subunit which is anchored to the viral membrane and is required for trimerization and fusion of the virus and host membrane 4-6 . The membrane bound host protease TMPRSS2 is responsible for S protein priming by cleavage of specific sites between S1 and S2. In addition to proteolytic activation of the S2' site, conformational changes and viral entry 7-10 . Antibodies against the spike protein of corona viruses are potential candidates for therapeutic development 11 . Antibodies against the S1 subunit, especially against RBD, can potently neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS 12-14 . Monoclonal human antibodies against SARS-CoV were also described to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, some of them were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 15,16 . In other approaches monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were selected by rescreening memory B-cells from a SARS patient 17 , selected from COVID-19 patients by single B-cell PCR 18,19 or using phage display 20,21 . Human recombinant antibodies were successfully used for the treatment of other viral diseases. The antibody mAb114 22 and the three antibody cocktail REGN-EB3 23 showed a good efficiency in clinical trials against Ebola virus 24 . The antibody palivizumab is EMA/FDA approved for treatment of a severe respiratory infection of infants caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 25,26 and could be used as a guideline to develop therapeutic antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Antibody phage display is a powerful tool to generate human antibodies against infectious diseases 27 . We successfully used this technology to develop in vivo protective antibodies 5/34 against Venezuelan encephalitis virus 28 , Western-equine encephalitis 29,30 , Marburg virus 31 and Ebola Sudan virus 32 . In this work, we generated human recombinant antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from a universal, human naive antibody gene library. The selected antibodies inhibited the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 expressing cells and blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of VeroE6 cells. These antibodies are potential candidates for the clinical development of passive immunotherapy for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. Antibodies were selected by phage display Antibodies were selected against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit in four panning rounds in microtiter plates. The following single clone screening was performed by antigen ELISA in 96 well MTPs, using soluble monoclonal scFv produced in E. coli. Subsequently, DNA encoding the binders was sequenced and unique antibodies were recloned as scFv-Fc fusions. In detail, three pannings strategies were compared. In a first approach (STE70) the lambda (HAL9) and kappa (HAL10) libraries were combined and the antigen S1-hFc (with furin site, produced in High Five cells) was immobilized in PBS. Here, only seven unique antibodies were identified. In a second approach, the selection was performed separately for HAL10 (STE72) and HAL9 (STE73) using S1-hFc as antigen (without furin site, SEC purified, immobilized in carbonate buffer). Here, 90 unique antibodies were selected from HAL10 and 210 from HAL9. In a third approach (STE77 and STE78), S1-hFc produced in Expi293F cells was used (immobilized in carbonate buffer). Here, the panning resulted in 7/34 Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant KFO342 to L. Brunotte and S. Ludwig.

485653d07fcaf397c7f76e11a00a40810299018b	The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 disease as a pandemic requiring a rapid response. Through online search, direct communication with network members and an internal survey, engagements of developing countries' vaccine manufacturers' network members in the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines and their capacities in the manufacturing, fill-finish and distribution of vaccines were assessed. Currently, 19 network members engaged in research and development of COVID-19 vaccines, using six principal technology platforms. In addition, an internal survey showed that the number of vaccines supplied collectively by 37 members, in 2018-19, was about 3.5 billion doses annually. Almost a third of network members having vaccines prequalified by the World Health Organization comply with international regulations and mechanisms to distribute vaccines across borders. The use of existing manufacturing, fill-finish and distribution capabilities can support an efficient roll-out of vaccines against COVID-19, while maintaining supply security of existing vaccines for on-going immunization programmes.
3cff423d90d10aed4310a7d726a6a873d37b2693	Significant concerns have been raised owing to the rapid global spread of infection and disease caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV). Recent studies suggest that ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually, further increasing the exposure risk for this virus. Associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalities in infants of ZIKV-infected mothers, as well as a rise in the occurrence of Guillain Barre' syndrome in infected adults. Importantly, there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection. In this study, we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel, synthetic, DNA vaccine targeting the pre-membrane+envelope proteins (prME) of ZIKV. Following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct, mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prME DNA-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced DNA delivery. Vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity. In mice lacking receptors for interferon (IFN)-α/β (designated IFNAR − / − ) immunisation with this DNA vaccine induced, following in vivo viral challenge, 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue. In addition, passive transfer of non-human primate anti-ZIKV immune serum protected IFNAR − / − mice against subsequent viral challenge. This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prME in ZIKV infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for ZIKV control and disease prevention in humans.
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is associated with profound compromises in host defenses. The patterns of immune compromise change over time. Infections are an important cause of serious morbidity and pose substantial threats to life. Thus, the challenges of infection facing the transplant clinician are both myriad and dynamic. Early after transplant, neutropenic infections are most important. Later herpesvirus and invasive fungal infections predominate. Even late after transplant, patients with chronic graft versus host disease remain susceptible to encapsulated bacterial, varicella zoster virus, and invasive fungal infections. Over time, with robust engraftment and control of GVHD, the risk of serious infections recedes with immune reconstitution.
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	Porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms, as well as by non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals. It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development.
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	The Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe disease and has pandemic potential. Therefore, development of antiviral strategies is an important task. The activation of the viral spike protein (S) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity and the responsible enzymes are potential therapeutic targets. The cellular proteases furin, cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 can activate MERS-S and may cleave the S protein at two distinct sites, termed S1/S2 and S2′. Moreover, a potential cathepsin L cleavage site in MERS-S has been reported. However, the relative importance of these sites for MERS-S activation is incompletely understood. Here, we used mutagenic analysis and MERS-S-bearing vectors to study the contribution of specific cleavage sites to S proteindriven entry. We found that an intact S1/S2 site was only required for efficient entry into cells expressing endogenous TMPRSS2. In keeping with a previous study, pre-cleavage at the S1/S2 motif (RSVR) was important although not essential for subsequent MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2, and indirect evidence was obtained that this motif is processed by a protease depending on an intact RXXR motif, most likely furin. In contrast, the S2′ site (RSAR) was required for robust viral entry into all cell lines tested and the integrity of one of the two arginines was sufficient for efficient entry. These findings suggest that cleavage at S2′ is carried out by proteases recognizing a single arginine, most likely TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Finally, mutation of the proposed cathepsin L site did not impact viral entry and double mutation of S1/S2 and S2′ site was compatible with cathepsin L-but not TMPRSS2-dependent host cell entry, indicating that cathepsin L can process the S protein at auxiliary sites. Collectively, our results indicate a rigid sequence requirement for S protein activation by TMPRSS2 but not cathepsin L.
9f548a03c496ef67ce743572cca4201debbf9910	Clinical research under the usual regulatory constraints may be difficult or even impossible in a public health emergency. Regulators must seek to strike a good balance in granting as wide therapeutic access to new drugs as possible at the same time as gathering sound evidence of safety and effectiveness. To inform current policy, I reexamine the philosophical rationale for restricting new medicines to clinical trials, at any stage and for any population of patients (which resides in the precautionary principle), to show that its objective to protect public health, now or in the future, could soon be defeated in a pandemic. Providing wider therapeutic access and coordinating observations and natural experiments, including service delivery by cluster (wedged cluster trials), may provide such a balance. However, there are important questions of fairness to resolve before any such research can proceed.
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	OBJECTIVES: YouTube has become the preferred resource for trainees in otolaryngology to prepare for surgery. This study aimed to compare the evaluation by 2 attending physicians and 2 resident physicians of the quality of videos on YouTube on neck dissection, a key indicator case in head and neck surgery. The authors aimed to assess the quality and quantity of YouTube videos available for development of a virtual surgical educational curriculum for trainees in otolaryngology. METHODS: Using the YouTube search feature, the top 10 videos by relevance and view count were compiled using the following search terms: radical neck dissection, selective neck dissection, modified radical neck dissection, lateral neck dissection, levels I-III neck dissection, levels II-IV, left neck dissection, right neck dissection, cervical nodal dissection, and supraomohyoid neck dissection. A total of 37 videos on neck dissection were identified and analyzed using the LAP-VEGaS criteria as well as authorspecific modified LAP-VEGaS criteria. The mean comprehensive LAP-VEGaS score was 8.74 (SD 3.10). The majority of videos (24/37) were designated as medium quality; 10 of 37 videos were low quality and 3 of 37 videos were high quality. In the total group analysis, there was excellent inter-rater reliability between attending physicians (Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.84) and good inter-rater reliability between resident physicians (Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.58). There was no correlation between total view count, video age, or number of likes/dislikes and the overall LAP-VEGaS score. The presence of audio or written commentary had a moderate positive correlation with LAP-VEGaS score (adjusted R 2 of 0.36). There was no statistically significant difference in video quality between videos posted by US and non-US based physicians (95% confidence interval À0.10 to 4.10; p = 0.06). However, videos made by an otolaryngology-trained physician had a LAP-VEGaS score that was 3.93 points higher (95% confidence interval 2.34-5.52; p < 0.001) than that of videos made by a nonotolaryngology-trained physician. CONCLUSIONS: Online videos of neck dissection represent an increasingly ubiquitous and appropriate resource for trainees in learning otolaryngology key indicator cases. While free-to-access video repositories, such as YouTube, have become increasingly popular among trainees as a primary resource for learning and preparing for surgical cases, they lack consistent quality and as such, global efforts should be taken to improve the breadth and depth of educational video content in otolaryngology.
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	The prevalence of poor sleep quality among students is very high and, in nursing students, has been associated with reduced performance, behavioral changes, dietary changes, and even aggressive behavior due to changes in sleep patterns. The lockdown in response to COVID-19 may have resulted in lifestyle changes that affected sleep quality. For this reason, the objective of this study is to determine the difference in nursing students' sleep quality before and during the lockdown, put in place in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To meet this objective, we conducted a longitudinal observational study on 207 nursing students, with two cut-off points (February and April). The main dependent variable was sleep quality, measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and its seven components. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used for paired and unpaired data, as well as group-stratified analysis. The mean time students spent in bed was 7.6 h (standard deviation (SD) = 1.1 h) before lockdown and 8.5 h (SD = 1.2 h) during lockdown. The PSQI score got 0.91 points worse during lockdown (95% CI, −0.51, −1.31). Of the five components, five were statistically significantly affected (p ≤ 0.05), and of these, the most changed were sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. When stratified by group, we observed differences in women, first-year students, second-year students, alcohol consumers, those of normal weight, and those that live with family. The main conclusion is that although students spent more time in bed, overall sleep quality was worse during lockdown, as well as being worse in five of the seven components.
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	The presence of a schema for XML documents has numerous advantages. Unfortunately, many XML documents in practice are not accompanied by a schema or a valid schema. Therefore, it is essential to devise algorithms to infer schemas. The fundamental task in XML schema inference is to learn regular expressions. In this paper, we focus on learning the subclass of RE(&) called SIREs (the subclass of regular expressions with interleaving). Previous work in this direction lacks inference algorithms that support inference from positive and negative examples. We provide an algorithm to learn SIREs from positive and negative examples based on genetic algorithms and parallel techniques. Our algorithm also has better expansibility, which means that our algorithm not only supports learning with positive and negative examples, but also supports learning with positive or negative examples only. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
16a4b3acbf0f8aeecd2156786377cbe85bd648aa	Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent an accessible tissue source for gene expression profiling in schizophrenia that could provide insight into the molecular basis of the disorder. This study used the Illumina HT_12 microarray platform and quantitative real time PCR (QPCR) to perform mRNA expression profiling on 114 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 80 non-psychiatric controls from the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB). Differential expression analysis revealed altered expression of 164 genes (59 up-regulated and 105 down-regulated) in the PBMCs from patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. Bioinformatic analysis indicated significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes known to be involved or associated with immune function and regulating the immune response. The differential expression of 6 genes, EIF2C2 (Ago 2), MEF2D, EVL, PI3, S100A12 and DEFA4 was confirmed by QPCR. Genome-wide expression analysis of PBMCs from individuals with schizophrenia was characterized by the alteration of genes with immune system function, supporting the hypothesis that the disorder has a significant immunological component in its etiology.
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	Defensins are an effector component of the innate immune system with broad antimicrobial activity. Humans express two types of defensins, -and -defensins, which have antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The diversity of defensin-sensitive viral species reflects a multitude of antiviral mechanisms. These include direct defensin targeting of viral envelopes, glycoproteins, and capsids in addition to inhibition of viral fusion and post-entry neutralization. Binding and modulation of host cell surface receptors and disruption of intracellular signaling by defensins can also inhibit viral replication. In addition, defensins can function as chemokines to augment and alter adaptive immune responses, revealing an indirect antiviral mechanism. Nonetheless, many questions regarding the antiviral activities of defensins remain. Although significant mechanistic data is known for -defensins, molecular details fordefensin inhibition are mostly lacking. Importantly, the role of defensin antiviral activity in vivo has not been addressed due to the lack of a complete defensin knockout model. Overall, the antiviral activity of defensins is well established as are the variety of mechanisms by which defensins achieve this inhibition; however, additional research is needed to fully understand the role of defensins in viral pathogenesis. simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) was one of the defining criteria in the identification and purification of the -defensins human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1), HNP2, and HNP3 from human neutrophils 3 . In this review, we will summarize the known activities of -anddefensins against viruses, and we refer the reader to additional recent reviews on this topic for further insight 4; 5; 6; 7 . Our focus will be primarily on human defensins, and we have organized our discussion by mechanism ( Figure 1 ) to emphasize commonalities in the antiviral activities of defensins against diverse viral families. The structure, evolution, and tissue distribution of defensins have been summarized in a number of recent reviews 4; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13 . Briefly, defensins are small (~29-42 amino acid) cationic, amphipathic peptides with a predominantly -sheet structure stabilized by 3 disulfide bonds. They can be broadly classified on the basis of structure and disulfide bond organization into three groups: -, -, and -defensins. As humans lack -defensins, they will not be discussed in detail; however, their antiviral properties have been recently reviewed 8; 14 . Humans express six -defensins and up to 31 -defensins 15 . The -defensins can be further subdivided into myeloid (HNP1-4) and enteric [human defensin (HD) 5 and 6] peptides on the basis of both expression patterns and genetic organization 11 . All of thedefensins have been shown to multimerize into at least dimers either in solution or in crystal structures 16; 17; 18; 19 . HNP1-4 are predominantly expressed by neutrophils but can also be found in or expressed by monocyte/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, some T cells, B cells, and immature dendritic cells (DCs) 11; 13 . HD5 and HD6 are expressed by specialized epithelial Paneth cells of the small intestine 20; 21 . HD5 is also expressed by epithelial cells in the male and female genitourinary tract 22; 23; 24; 25 . Human -defensins (HBDs) are more widely expressed by epithelial cells in skin and at mucosal surfaces in contact with the environment 26 . Like the -defensins, some -defensins (e.g., HBD3) exist in oligomeric forms, while others, such as HBD1 and HBD2, are monomeric 27 . They are also expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and certain DCs, and a subset of -defensins are only expressed in the male reproductive tract 26; 28 . Although there are commonalities in expression patterns of defensins in humans and other species, one important difference relevant for experimental models of infectious disease is that mice lack myeloiddefensins 29; 30 . Quantification of physiologic defensin concentrations in vivo is complex, as defensins are present at high local concentrations within specific cell types or upon release from cells into confined anatomical niches (e.g., crypts of the small intestine) but can become diluted in extracellular fluids. For the myeloid -defensins, Daher et al. estimated ~3 mM (10 mg/ml) HNPs in neutrophils, with even higher local concentrations in the azurophilic granules in which they are stored 1 . For the enteric -defensins, Ayabe et al. estimated concentrations of ≥3.5 mM (15-100 mg/ml) in the crypt lumen, the site of Paneth cell degranulation 31 . These concentrations are likely similar in the human small intestine, where HD5 expression exceeds that of HD6 by 6-fold 32 . In healthy patients, epithelial lining fluid of the lung contains 31-79 nM HNP1-3, nasal fluid contains ~2.7 M HNP1-3, saliva contains 0.3-3 M HNP1-3, and vaginal secretions contain ~1.5 M HNPs and 0.3-14 M HD5 23; 33; 34; 35; 36; 37; 38 . For the -defensins, 5-10 nM HBD2 has been measured in nasal fluid 37; 39 . However, in certain disease states defensin levels can be highly elevated. For example, 57 M to 2.4 mM concentrations of HNP1 have been found in epithelial lining fluid of cystic fibrosis patients 36 . Overall, the concentrations of defensins present in vivo are generally within the range that is needed for direct antiviral activity by -defensins and generally below the concentrations required for direct antiviral activity by -defensins.

8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	Human cathepsin W (CtsW) is a cysteine protease, which was identified in a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen to be required for influenza A virus (IAV) replication. In this study, we show that reducing the levels of expression of CtsW reduces viral titers for different subtypes of IAV, and we map the target step of CtsW requirement to viral entry. Using a set of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting CtsW, we demonstrate that knockdown of CtsW results in a decrease of IAV nucleoprotein accumulation in the nuclei of infected cells at 3 h postinfection. Assays specific for the individual stages of IAV entry further show that attachment, internalization, and early endosomal trafficking are not affected by CtsW knockdown. However, we detected impaired escape of viral particles from late endosomes in CtsW knockdown cells. Moreover, fusion analysis with a dual-labeled influenza virus revealed a significant reduction in fusion events, with no detectable impact on endosomal pH, suggesting that CtsW is required at the stage of viral fusion. The defect in IAV entry upon CtsW knockdown could be rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type CtsW but not by the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of CtsW, suggesting that the proteolytic activity of CtsW is required for successful entry of IAV. Our results establish CtsW as an important host factor for entry of IAV into target cells and suggest that CtsW could be a promising target for the development of future antiviral drugs. vealed hundreds of potential cellular targets. However, we have only limited knowledge on how these factors support virus replication, which would be required for drug development. We have characterized cathepsin W, one of the candidate factors, and found that cathepsin W is required for escape of influenza virus from the late endosome. Importantly, this required the proteolytic activity of cathepsin W. We therefore suggest that cathepsin W could be a target for future host cell-directed antiviral therapies.

de79ddbf8cff4bf83533c1c991cf5640dab43ea5	While active immunization elicits a lasting immune response by the body, passive immunotherapy transiently equips the body with exogenously generated immunological effectors in the form of either target-specific antibodies or lymphocytes functionalized with target-specific receptors. In either case, administration or expression of recombinant proteins plays a fundamental role. mRNA prepared by in vitro transcription (IVT) is increasingly appreciated as a drug substance for delivery of recombinant proteins. With its biological role as transient carrier of genetic information translated into protein in the cytoplasm, therapeutic application of mRNA combines several advantages. For example, compared to transfected DNA, mRNA harbors inherent safety features. It is not associated with the risk of inducing genomic changes and potential adverse effects are only temporary due to its transient nature. Compared to the administration of recombinant proteins produced in bioreactors, mRNA allows supplying proteins that are difficult to manufacture and offers extended pharmacokinetics for short-lived proteins. Based on great progress in understanding and manipulating mRNA properties, efficacy data in various models have now demonstrated that IVT mRNA constitutes a potent and flexible platform technology. Starting with an introduction into passive immunotherapy, this review summarizes the current status of IVT mRNA technology and its application to such immunological interventions.
8c593d726094e8a047376050bd28806e371a2797	Proteomics is the large-scale study of the structure and function of proteins in complex biological sample. Such an approach has the potential value to understand the complex nature of the organism. Current proteomic tools allow large-scale, highthroughput analyses for the detection, identification, and functional investigation of proteome. Advances in protein fractionation and labeling techniques have improved protein identification to include the least abundant proteins. In addition, proteomics has been complemented by the analysis of posttranslational modifications and techniques for the quantitative comparison of different proteomes. However, the major limitation of proteomic investigations remains the complexity of biological structures and physiological processes, rendering the path of exploration paved with various difficulties and pitfalls. The quantity of data that is acquired with new techniques places new challenges on data processing and analysis. This article provides a brief overview of currently available proteomic techniques and their applications, followed by detailed description of advantages and technical challenges. Some solutions to circumvent technical difficulties are proposed.
28455eedb8cadf60e6fd08d82a1052e9307315d1	During the emergence of a pandemic, we need to estimate the prevalence of a disease using serological assays whose characterization is incomplete, relying on limited validation data. This introduces uncertainty for which we need to account. In our treatment, the data take the form of continuous assay measurements of antibody response to antigens (eg. ELISA), and fall into two groups. The training data includes the confirmed positive or negative infection status for each sample. The population data includes only the assay measurements, and is assumed to be a random sample from the population from which we estimate the seroprevalence. We use the training data to model the relationship between assay values and infection status, capturing both individual-level uncertainty in infection status, as well as uncertainty due to limited training data. We then estimate the posterior distribution over population prevalence, additionally capturing uncertainty due to finite samples. Finally, we introduce a means to pool information over successive time points, using a Gaussian process, which dramatically reduces the variance of our estimates. The methodological approach we here describe was developed to support the longitudinal characterization of the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Stockholm, Sweden.
030b9ba1c0202c07d05f55ea3f0cc28c431b262b	On Halloween night 2014 I stood with thousands of others along the side of a large boulevard in Amsterdam. There was an excited buzz rippling through the crowd and young children zipped in and out, threading their way around their parents and friends, vying for the best viewing locations. Their cries and laughter fi lled the air alongside the adult conversation and the sound of phones ringing as people attempted to fi nd each other in the crowd. We were all waiting with mounting excitement for the annual Halloween Parade. It was running late. Heads turned down the street, cameras and phones at the ready, watching for any sign that the parade was arriving. Expectation hung in the air. Finally … music. And then a truck disguised as a giant metal dragon belching smoke and music lurched into view, followed by a slow moving phalanx of participants, all in Halloween costumes. Some of the walkers were waving at the crowd, others were ignoring us, while still others lunged at unsuspecting individuals with threatening roars and grimaces. An armada of decorated vehicles, fl anked by phalanxes of monsters and ghouls moved slowly along the street. Loud music blared out from each of the decorated trucks and cars interspersed amongst the walkers; some walkers carried their own drums and many blew on whistles. The result was a cacophony of noise and a visual smorgasbord of horror. There were the usual Friday the 13th outfi ts, a few Freddy Kruegers, too many creepy clowns, vampish nurses and devil costumes, but what stood out were the zombies. There were baby zombies, school-aged zombies, decaying zombies, sexy zombies, zombie families, zombies young and zombies old. We clapped and screamed our appreciation at all of them. Some zombie costumes were highly professional with exposed teeth, ghoulish eyes and rotting bloody fl esh while others

Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection. In this study, we used a cellular model of adhesion to investigate whether natural antibodies of the ABO system could block the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. To this aim, a C-terminally EGFP-tagged S protein was expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with an α1,2fucosyltransferase and an A-transferase in order to coexpress the S glycoprotein ectodomain and the A antigen at the cell surface. We observed that the S protein/angiotensinconverting enzyme 2-dependent adhesion of these cells to an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressing cell line was specifically inhibited by either a monoclonal or human natural anti-A antibodies, indicating that these antibodies may block the interaction between the virus and its receptor, thereby providing protection. In order to more fully appreciate the potential effect of the ABO polymorphism on the epidemiology of SARS, we built a mathematical model of the virus transmission dynamics that takes into account the protective effect of ABO natural antibodies. The model indicated that the ABO polymorphism could contribute to substantially reduce the virus transmission, affecting both the number of infected individuals and the kinetics of the epidemic. 1085 P Guillon et al.
8f7ab69dc2f88db27425f5572a910ec416b65bef	When large industrial organizations change to (or start with) an agile approach to operations, managers and some employees are supposed to be "agile leaders" often without being given a clear definition of what that comprises when building agile teams. An inductive thematic analysis was used to investigate what 15 appointed leaders actually do and perceive as challenges regarding group dynamics working with an agile approach. Team maturity, Team design, and Culture and mindset were all categories of challenges related to group dynamics that the practitioners face and manage in their work-life that are not explicitly mentioned in the more process-focused agile transformation frameworks. The results suggest that leader mitigation of these three aspects of group dynamics is essential to the success of an agile transformation.
4c565559fff97813a77571986c4c0b34fa3f4d46	Inhibition of host-encoded targets, such as the cyclophilins, provides an opportunity to generate potent, high barrier to resistance antivirals for the treatment of a broad range of viral diseases. However, many host-targeted agents are natural products which can be difficult to optimize using synthetic chemistry alone. We describe the orthogonal combination of bioengineering and semisynthetic chemistry to optimize the drug-like properties of sanglifehrin A, a known cyclophilin inhibitor of mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide origin in order to generate the drug candidate NVP018 (formerly BC556). NVP018 is a potent inhibitor of HBV, HCV and HIV-1 replication, shows minimal inhibition of major drug transporters and has a high barrier to generation of both HCV and HIV-1 resistance.
d0449447fae588a525bb69bd7ea464b71d2bbe5d	The most prevalent method for SARS-CoV-2 testing is based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of viral RNA. With more established testing protocols, evidence has emerged that accurate results are predicated on the three principle concepts of proper timing, proper site, and proper sample acquisition. There are multiple factors which bear on test interpretation and account for geotemporal differences in prevalence such as the negative predictive value and false omission rate. However, within the health care setting and against the background of a virus with no reliable treatment or vaccine, the false negative rate represents one of the most important
cddbec166688aaf25aa6e2e6dc76a90668ba9e9d	InterFeron Inducible TransMembrane proteins 1-3 (IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) are a family of proteins capable of inhibiting the cellular entry of numerous human and animal viruses. IFITM1-3 are unique amongst the currently described viral restriction factors in their apparent ability to block viral entry. This restrictive property is dependant on the localisation of the proteins to plasma and endosomal membranes, which constitute the main portals of viral entry into cells. The topology of the IFITM proteins within cell membranes is an unresolved aspect of their biology. Here we present data from immunofluorescence microscopy, protease cleavage, biotin-labelling and immuno-electron microscopy assays, showing that human IFITM1 has a membrane topology in which the N-terminal domain resides in the cytoplasm, and the C-terminal domain is extracellular. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this topology is conserved for all of the human interferoninduced IFITM proteins. This model is consistent with that recently proposed for murine IFITM3, but differs from that proposed for murine IFITM1.
2497aa3d6369d40ea02f64f3d81d360f81bd0dcb	Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Deltacoronavirus) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea/vomiting, dehydration and mortality in seronegative neonatal piglets. PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014, concurrently with co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus). The origin of PDCoV in pigs and also its sudden emergence or route of introduction into the US still remains unclear. In the US, since 2013-2014, the newly emerged PDCoV and PEDV have spread nationwide, causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts. The current US PDCoV strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. Similar to PEDV infections, PDCoV infections also cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, followed by dehydration as the potential cause of death in nursing piglets. At present, differential diagnosis of PDCoV, PEDV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is essential to control viral diarrheas in US swine. Cell culture-adapted US PDCoV (TC-PDCoV) strains have been isolated and propagated by us and in several other laboratories. TC-PDCoV strains will be useful to develop serologic assays and to evaluate if serial cell-culture passage attenuates TC-PDCoV as a potential vaccine candidate strain. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of epidemic PDCoV strains is currently needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective vaccine. This review focuses on the etiology, cell culture isolation and propagation, molecular epidemiology, disease mechanisms and pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.
6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02	To see whether genetic polymorphisms regulate inter-individual differences in T cell subset levels, we have conducted a genome scan in two populations of mice, bred as the progeny of a cross between CB6F1 females and C3D2F1 males. The data document quantitative trait loci (QTL) with statistically significant effects on CD4, CD8, and CD8 memory T cells, and on subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells that express P-glycoprotein. Some of the loci detected were robust, in the sense that they produced effects of similar size both in mated female mice, and in a population that included male and female virgin animals. Some of the effects were stable, in that they were apparent at both 8 and 18 months of age, but others were age-specific, showing effects either at 8 or at 18 months but not at both ages. Genes that had an effect on the same T cell subset were in almost all cases additive rather than epistatic, and their combined effects could produce large overall effects, leading in the most dramatic case to a two-fold difference in CD8 memory cells. The analysis also documented two QTL, on chromosomes 4 and 13, that regulate an age-sensitive composite index of T cell subset pattern which has been shown previously to be a predictor of life expectancy in these mice. The analysis thus reveals both subset-specific genes and others which modulate the overall pattern of age-sensitive changes in T cell subset distributions.
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	One of the hurdles to understanding the role of viral quasispecies in RNA virus cross-species transmission (CST) events is the need to analyze a densely sampled outbreak using deep sequencing in order to measure the amount of mutation occurring on a small time scale. In 2009, the California Department of Public Health reported a dramatic increase (.350%) in the number of gray foxes infected with a rabies virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in Humboldt County. To better understand the evolution of rabies, deep-sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the Humboldt outbreak. For each sample, approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Average coverage was 17,4486and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths. Phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date (1995 vs. 2009) and geographic location (northern vs. southern). A single amino acid change in the G protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks, suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region. Deepsequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the CST event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003-2010 were present at the sub-consensus level (as rare variants in the viral population) in skunk and fox samples from 1995. These results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change.

780fd3f8a8f44d9f1b4aee2662c16b1e490c4488	The molecular structure of 4-methylpiridine-N-oxide, 4-MePyO, has been studied by gas-phase electron diffraction monitored by mass spectrometry (GED/MS) and quantum chemical (DFT) calculations. Both, quantum chemistry and GED analyses resulted in C S molecular symmetry with the planar pyridine ring. Obtained molecular parameters confirm the hyperconjugation in the pyridine ring and the sp 2 hybridization concept of the nitrogen and carbon atoms in the ring. The experimental geometric parameters are in a good agreement with the parameters for non-substituted N-oxide and reproduced very closely by DFT calculations. The presence of the electron-donating CH 3 substituent in 4-MePyO leads to a decrease of the ipso-angle and to an increase of r(N/O) in comparison with the non-substituted PyO. Electron density distribution analysis has been performed in terms of natural bond orbitals (NBO) scheme. The nature of the semipolar N/O bond is discussed.
7992d4ddaf7e50b7d6c47500ca9a7b1dac5abe78	In the present work, the succinic acid (SA), L-pyroglutamic acid (L-PGA), N-phenyl-thioacetamide (N-NPTA), 2amino-5-chloropyridine hydrogen succinate (ACPS), epigallocatechine Gallate (EGCG) or KDH and, selenomethionine (SeM) compounds have been proposed as potential antiviral candidates to treatment of COVID-19 based on B3LYP/6-311þþG** calculations and molecular docking. Solvation energies, stabilization energies, topological properties have been evaluated as function of acceptors and donors groups present in their structures. ACPS presents the higher reactivity in solution possibly because has the higher nucleophilicity and elecrophilicity indexes while KDH evidence the higher solvation energy probably due to the higher quantity of donors and acceptors groups. NBO studies show that KDH is the most stable in solution. Mapped MEP surfaces have evidenced stronger nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in ACPS, in agreement with the three C¼O and two N-H and O-H groups present in this species while KDH has only a C¼O group but a total of 19 acceptors and donors groups. From the above studies for six species we can propose that the better potential antiviral candidate to treatment of COVID-19 is ACPS and then, KDH. For a better prediction of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of the proposed compounds, molecular docking calculations were performed by using four structures of COVID-19. Docking results were discussed basing on binding affinities and the interaction types among ligands and different amino acid residues, indicating the powerful ability of KDH and then ACPS ligands on front of the novel coronavirus disease especially for the first and the fourth species (6LU7, 7BTF).
0c46c22adbfc1d4129f7c8e7a8c2a1ed6bc91501	Natural Language Processing (NLP) library is widely used while analyzing software documents. The numerous toolkits result in a problem on NLP library selection. The selection of NLP library in current work commonly misses some objective reasons, which may pose threats to validity. And it is also not clear that whether the existing guideline on selection still works for the latest versions. In this work, we propose a solution for NLP library selection when the effectiveness is unknown. We use the NLP libraries together in a combined method. Our combined method can utilize the strengths of different NLP libraries to obtain accurate results. The combination is conducted through two steps, i.e., document-level selection of NLP library and sentence-level overwriting. In document-level selection of primary library, the results are obtained from the library that has the highest overall accuracy. Through sentence-level overwriting, the possible fine-gained improvements from other libraries are extracted to overwrite the outputs of primary library. We evaluate the combined method with 4 widely used NLP libraries and 200 documents from 3 different sources. The results show that the combined method can generally outperform all the studied NLP libraries in terms of accuracy. The finding means that our combined method can be used instead of individual NLP library for more effective results.
9d549f248a08f641c87bbdbc6a0ca3ad83b64b2a	Ti-containing a-Keggin polyoxometalates (POMs) have been proved with properties of both anti-tumor and anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). The potential anti-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) activity of the POMs [a-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7À isomers was investigated in this paper by molecular modeling method. The SARS 3c like protease, namely the SARS 3CL pro is the key function protease for virus replication as well as transcription and thus can be taken as one of the key targets for anti-SARS drug design. Affinity/ Insight II was used to explore possible binding locations for POMs/3CL pro interaction. Charges in the POMs were obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) method. The results show that POMs bind with 3CL pro in the active site region with high affinity; POMs are more prone to bind with 3CL pro than with some organic compounds; for the POMs/3CL pro complex, the OTi 2 in POMs is the vital element for electrostatic interaction, and the electrostatic binding energy is strong enough to keep the complex stable.
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	Background: Phylogeny estimation from aligned haplotype sequences has attracted more and more attention in the recent years due to its importance in analysis of many fine-scale genetic data. Its application fields range from medical research, to drug discovery, to epidemiology, to population dynamics. The literature on molecular phylogenetics proposes a number of criteria for selecting a phylogeny from among plausible alternatives. Usually, such criteria can be expressed by means of objective functions, and the phylogenies that optimize them are referred to as optimal. One of the most important estimation criteria is the parsimony which states that the optimal phylogeny T * for a set H of n haplotype sequences over a common set of variable loci is the one that satisfies the following requirements: (i) it has the shortest length and (ii) it is such that, for each pair of distinct haplotypes h i , h j ∈ H, the sum of the edge weights belonging to the path from h i to h j in T * is not smaller than the observed number of changes between h i and h j . Finding the most parsimonious phylogeny for H involves solving an optimization problem, called the Most Parsimonious Phylogeny Estimation Problem (MPPEP), which is N P-hard in many of its versions. Results: In this article we investigate a recent version of the MPPEP that arises when input data consist of single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes extracted from a population of individuals on a common genomic region. Specifically, we explore the prospects for improving on the implicit enumeration strategy of implicit enumeration strategy used in previous work using a novel problem formulation and a series of strengthening valid inequalities and preliminary symmetry breaking constraints to more precisely bound the solution space and accelerate implicit enumeration of possible optimal phylogenies. We present the basic formulation and then introduce a series of provable valid constraints to reduce the solution space. We then prove that these constraints can often lead to significant reductions in the gap between the optimal solution and its non-integral linear programming bound relative to the prior art as well as often substantially faster processing of moderately hard problem instances. Conclusion: We provide an indication of the conditions under which such an optimal enumeration approach is likely to be feasible, suggesting that these strategies are usable for relatively large numbers of taxa, although with stricter limits on numbers of variable sites. The work thus provides methodology suitable for provably optimal solution of some harder instances that resist all prior approaches.
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	Background: Ebola hemorrhagic fever is caused by the Ebola filovirus (EBOV), which is one of the most aggressive infectious agents known worldwide. The EBOV pathogenesis starts with uncontrolled viral replication and subversion of both the innate and adaptive host immune response. The multifunctional viral VP35 protein is involved in this process by exerting an antagonistic action against the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) response, and represents a suitable target for the development of strategies to control EBOV infection. Phage display technology permits to select antibodies as single chain Fragment variable (scFv) from an artificial immune system, due to their ability to specifically recognize the antigen of interest. ScFv is ideal for genetic manipulation and to obtain antibody constructs useful for targeting either antigens expressed on cell surface or intracellular antigens if the scFv is expressed as intracellular antibody (intrabody) or delivered into the cells. Results: Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in scFv format specific for the EBOV VP35 were isolated from the ETH-2 library of human recombinant antibodies by phage display technology. Five different clones were identified by sequencing, produced in E.coli and expressed in CHO mammalian cells to be characterized in vitro. All the selected scFvs were able to react with recombinant VP35 protein in ELISA, one of the scFvs being also able to react in Western Blot assay (WB). In addition, all scFvs were expressed in cell cytoplasm as intrabodies; a luciferase reporter gene inhibition assay performed in A549 cells showed that two of the scFvs can significantly hamper the inhibition of the IFN-β-induced RIG-I signaling cascade mediated by EBOV VP35. Conclusion: Five antibodies in scFv format recognize an active form of EBOV VP35 in ELISA, while one antibody also recognizes VP35 in WB. Two of these scFvs were also able to interfere with the intracellular activity of VP35 in a cell system in vitro. These findings suggest that such antibodies in scFv format might be employed to develop therapeutic molecules able to hamper EBOV infections.

Within the first 24 h of life, 36 calves were experimentally challenged with C. parvum oocysts at one of four possible magnitudes of oral exposure (1×10 3 , 1×10 4 , 1×10 5 , and 1× 10 6 oocysts), and 7 control calves were sham dosed. Fecal shedding occurred in 33 (91.7 %) experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves. There was a difference in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups; calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure (1×10 3 oocysts) shed less than the other three groups. At higher magnitudes of exposure, there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding. There was an inverse relationship between the log-total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf, i.e., the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding, the fewer oocysts that were shed. The pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear; the number of oocysts increased with time, reached a peak, and declined. Therefore, the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting exposure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding.

In a cross-sectional study, 135 children, ≤5 years of age who presented with ARTIs in Najran Maternity and Children Hospital, Najran, Saudi Arabia between October 2012 and July 2013 were included. The clinical and sociodemographic data, and the laboratory results were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each child: one for bacteriological examination, and the second for viral detection using multiplex RT-PCR.

We modelled the relationship of various predictors (health systems variables, population and population health indicators) together with variables indicating public health measures (school closures, border closures, country lockdown) in 40 European and other countries, using Generalized Linear Models and minimized information criteria to select the best fitting and most parsimonious models. We fitted two models with log-linearly linked variables on gamma-distributed outome variables (CoV2 cases and Covid-19 related deaths, standardized on population). Population standardized cases were best predicted by number of tests, life-expectancy in a country, and border closure (negative predictor, i.e. preventive). Population standardized deaths were best predicted by time, the virus had been in the country, life expectancy, smoking (negative predictor, i.e. preventive), and school closures (positive predictor, i.e. accelerating). Model fit statistics and model adequacy were good. Interestingly, none of the variables that code for the preparedness of the medical system, for health status or other population parameters were predictive. Of the public health variables only border closure had the potential of preventing cases and none were predictors for preventing deaths. School closures, likely as a proxy for social distancing, was associated with increased deaths. The pandemic seems to run its autonomous course and only border closure has the potential to prevent cases. None of the contributes to preventing deaths.
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	AIM: To report on a snap audit of all departments in the UK as to the value of preoperative thoracic imaging, preferably computed tomography (CT), of patients undergoing any surgery to assess for changes consistent with COVID-19 preoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Imaging departments in the UK were contacted and asked to record the number of preoperative CT examinations performed in patients being considered for both emergency and elective surgical intervention over a 5-day period in May 2020. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of departments replied with data provided on >820 patients. Nineteen percent of additional preoperative CT was in patients undergoing elective intervention and 81% in patients presenting with surgical abdominal pain. There was a high rate of false positives in patients who tested negative for COVID-19, producing a sensitivity for thoracic CT of 68.4%. CONCLUSION: This UK-wide audit demonstrates that a large number of additional thoracic imaging examinations over a 5-day period were performed with a low sensitivity for the identification of COVID-19 in this preoperative group of patients. Given these findings, it is difficult to justify this additional examination in this group of patients. REFERENCES 1. BSGAR.

9396d61cd7f362ab076c9e58d54e2d96bd768a21	The purpose of this study was to compare the risk factors, clinical manifestations, and outcome of candidemia in immunocompromised (IC) and nonimmunocompromised (NIC) critically ill patients. Data were collected prospectively over a 2-year period (02/2000-01/ 2002) from patients in a 25-bed, medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Eligible for participation in this study were patients who developed candidemia during their ICU stay. Patients under antifungal therapy and with a confirmed systemic fungal infection prior to the diagnosis of candidemia were excluded. Cultures of blood, urine, and stool were performed for all patients in the study, and all patients underwent endoscopy/biopsy of the esophagus for detection of Candida. Smears and/or scrapings of oropharyngeal and esophageal lesions were examined for hyphae and/or pseudohyphae and were also cultured for yeasts. During the study period, 1,627 patients were hospitalized in the ICU, 57% for primary medical reasons and 43% for surgical reasons. After application of the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 patients with candidemia (9 IC and 15 NIC) were analyzed. Total parenteral nutrition was more common in IC than in NIC patients (9/9 [100%] vs 8/ 15 [53%], p = 0.02). Oropharyngeal candidiasis was detected in 5 of 9 (55.5%) IC patients and in 1 of 15 (6.5%) NIC patients (p=0.015). Esophageal candidiasis was also more common in IC than in NIC patients (4/9 [44%] vs 0/15 [0%], p=0.012). Among the 9 IC patients, all except 2 died, resulting in a crude mortality of 78%; among the 15 NIC patients, 9 died, resulting in a crude mortality of 60% (p>0.05). Autopsy was performed in two IC and in six NIC patients, with disseminated candidiasis found in one IC patient. Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are frequent in IC patients with candidemia. In contrast, this coexistence is rare in NIC critically ill patients with Candida bloodstream infections. A high mortality was noted in both IC and NIC critically ill patients with candidemia.

Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and predicted to be affected significantly over a longer time period. Our paper aims to provide detailed reporting and analyses of the present rapid responses to COVID-19, between January and March 2020, in Indonesia. We particularly highlight responses taken by the governments, non-government organisations and the community. We outline gaps and limitations in the responses, based on our rapid analysis of media contents, from government speeches and reports, social and mass media platforms. We present five recommendations toward more rapid, effective, and comprehensive responses.
