7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	introduction : community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) account for a high proportion of icu admissions , with streptococcus pneumoniae being the main pathogen responsible for these infections .
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	however , little is known on the clinical features and outcomes of icu patients with pneumococcal pneumonia .
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	the aims of this study were to provide epidemiological data and to determine risk factors of mortality in patients admitted to icu for severe s. pneumoniae cap .
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	patients admitted for management of severe pneumococcal cap were enrolled if they met the 2001 american thoracic society criteria for severe pneumonia , had life - threatening organ failure and had a positive microbiological sample for s. pneumoniae .
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	patients with bronchitis , aspiration pneumonia or with non - pulmonary pneumococcal infections were excluded .
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	acute respiratory failure ( n = 154 ) and septic shock ( n = 54 ) were their most frequent causes of icu admission .
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	bacteraemia was diagnosed in 101 patients .
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	the prevalence of s. pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 39.7 % .
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	co - morbidities , macrolide administration , concomitant bacteremia or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome .

a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	the largest nosocomial outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) occurred in south korea in 2015 .
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	health care personnel ( hcp ) are at high risk of acquiring mers - coronavirus ( mers - cov ) infections , similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars)-coronavirus ( sars - cov ) infections first identified in 2003 .
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	this study described the similarities and differences in epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 183 confirmed global mers cases and 98 sars cases in taiwan associated with hcp .
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	the epidemiological findings showed that the mean age of mers - hcp and total mers cases were 40 ( 24~74 ) and 49 ( 2~90 ) years , respectively , much older than those in sars
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	[ sars - hcp : 35
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	( 21~68 ) years , p = 0.006 ; total sars : 42 ( 0~94 ) years , p = 0.0002 ] .
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	the case fatality rates ( cfr ) was much lower in mers - hcp [ 7.03 % ( 9/128 ) ] or sars - hcp [ 12.24 % ( 12/ 98 ) ] than the mers - non - hcp [ 36.96 % ( 34/92 ) , p<0.001 ] or sars - non - hcp [ 24.50 % ( 61/ 249 ) , p<0.001 ] , however , no difference was found between mers - hcp and sars - hcp [ p = 0.181 ] .
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	in terms of clinical period , the days from onset to death [ 13 ( 4~17 ) vs 14.5 ( 0~52 ) , p = 0.045 ] and to discharge [ 11 ( 5~24 ) vs 24 ( 0~74 ) , p = 0.010 ] and be hospitalized days [ 9.5 ( 3~22 ) vs 22 ( 0~69 ) , p = 0.040 ] were much shorter in mers - hcp than sars - hcp .
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	similarly , days from onset to confirmation were shorter in mers - hcp than mers - non - hcp [ 6 ( 1~14 )
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	in conclusion , the severity of mers - hcp and sars - hcp was lower than that of mers - non - hcp and sars - non - hcp due to younger age and early confirmation in hcp groups .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	we advance the premise that to navigate crisis , rather than reactively cutting costs by culling middle management , top managers can benefit from enabling radical change initiatives by middle managers .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the covid-19 crisis , we ask : how can chief marketing officers ( cmos ) support marketing middle managers ( mmms ) in initiating radical change in crisis situations ?
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	we take the position that marketing managers ' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new - to - the - firm .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	we then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ' who does what ' in radical change initiatives from the marketing function , focusing on the underemphasized possibility of mmms initiating change and cmos implementing .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	building on recent findings on ' change role reversal ' , we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate , while top managers implement .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	this unconventional change route would see cmos taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis , while mmms take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	we identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal - approach faced by mmms throughout three stages of innovation - enabled radical change proposed by burgelman ( 1991 ; variation - selection - retention ) and chart corresponding roles that cmos can play to support mmms : advisor , judge , and guardian .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	three tangible final questions addressed to cmos guide managerial applications , while considerations outside scope are also discussed .

05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	although the covid-19 is known to cause by human - to - human transmission , it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	a retrospective study is conducted to study whether air quality index ( aqi ) , four ambient air pollutants ( pm 2.5 , pm 10 , no 2 and co ) and five meteorological variables ( daily temperature , highest temperature , lowest temperature , temperature difference and sunshine duration ) could increase covid-19 incidence in wuhan and xiaogan between jan 26 th to feb 29 th in 2020 .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	first , a significant correlation was found between covid-19 incidence and aqi in both wuhan ( r 2 = 0.13 , p<0.05 ) and xiaogan ( r 2 = 0.223 , p<0.01 ) .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	specifically , among four pollutants , covid-19 incidence was prominently correlated with pm 2.5 and no 2 in both cities .

1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	hence , we successfully identified human and virus encoded mirnas that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host mirnas could target sars - cov-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	we identified non - coding sequences in sars - cov-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards sars pathology .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	the study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals .

f018f29902aeb637122ec6e8b714df07a29a420e	the mapping of sars - cov-2 human protein - protein interactions by gordon and colleagues revealed druggable targets that are hijacked by the virus .
f018f29902aeb637122ec6e8b714df07a29a420e	here , we highlight several oncogenic pathways identifi ed at the host - virus interface of sars - cov-2 to enable cancer biologists to apply their knowledge for rapid drug repurposing to treat covid-19 , and help inform the response to potential long - term complications of the disease .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	development of small molecule compounds that target several cancer drivers has shown great therapeutic potential .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	here , we developed a new generation of highly potent thienopyranone ( tp)based inhibitors for the bet bromodomains ( bds ) of the transcriptional regulator brd4 that have the ability to simultaneously bind to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase ( pi3 k ) and/or cyclin - dependent kinases 4/6 ( cdk4/6 ) .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	analysis of the crystal structures of the complexes , nmr titration experiments and ic 50 measurements reveal the molecular basis underlying the inhibitory effects and selectivity of these compounds toward bds of brd4 .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	the inhibitors show robust cytotoxic effects in multiple cancer cell lines and induce cell - cycle arrest and apoptosis .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	the bromodomain and extra - terminal domain ( bet ) proteins have emerged as promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of a wide array of human diseases , particularly inflammation and cancer 1 - 5 .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	of the four members of the bet family proteins , brd4 is the most thoroughly characterized , and its aberrant activity has been associated with nut midline carcinoma , colon , breast and prostate cancers , neuroblastoma , and hematopoietic cancers .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	most recently brd4 has been identified as the human protein to which the protein e from the sars - cov-2 virus binds 6 .

18b5af09d99469ad7872da1b5bf4beb19c909ec1	the discovery of angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) 2 adds a new level of complexity to the understanding of the renin - angiotensin system .
18b5af09d99469ad7872da1b5bf4beb19c909ec1	the high catalytic efficiency of ace2 for the generation of angiotensin ( ang)-1 - 7 from ang ii suggests an important role of ace2 in preventing ang ii accumulation , while at the same time enhancing ang-1 - 7 formation .
18b5af09d99469ad7872da1b5bf4beb19c909ec1	ace and ace2 may have counterbalancing functions and a regulatory role in fine - tuning the rate at which ang peptides are formed and degraded .
18b5af09d99469ad7872da1b5bf4beb19c909ec1	by counterregulating the actions of ace on ang ii formation , ace2 may play a role in maintaining a balanced status of the reninangiotensin system .
18b5af09d99469ad7872da1b5bf4beb19c909ec1	this review focuses on the function of ace2 and its possible roles in kidney disease and hypertension .
18b5af09d99469ad7872da1b5bf4beb19c909ec1	studies using models of ace2 ablation and the pharmacologic administration of an ace2 inhibitor suggest that decreased ace2 activity alone or in combination with increased ace activity may play a role in both diseases .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	as one of the most important mosquito - borne viral diseases , dengue infection is now becoming a global concern due to its rapid spread and rise in incidence .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	currently , there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral drug for dengue virus ( denv ) infection .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	glycyrrhetinic acid ( gna ) and its related derivatives have been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	however , it is unknown whether carbenoxolone disodium ( cbx ) , one of the gna derivatives , affects denv infection .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	here , we found that the production of infectious denv particles was significantly decreased by cbx treatment in denv - permissive cells , while the viral rna and viral protein synthesis were not affected .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	moreover , results from time - of - addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of cbx on denv was exhibited by targeting the virus itself , not the host cells .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	directly incubating denv with cbx resulted in a remarkable reduction of virus titer and virus infectivity .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	taken together , these data indicate that the antiviral activity of cbx against denv may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	our work , for the first time , demonstrates that cbx has antiviral activity against denv infection , providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against dengue .
5f6b864972de6f6797dc83a45d4aafbeeae5e9aa	the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has become a global public health emergency .

5f6b864972de6f6797dc83a45d4aafbeeae5e9aa	for rna viruses , virus - encoded rna helicases have long been recognized to play pivotal roles during viral life cycles by facilitating the correct folding and replication of viral rnas .
5f6b864972de6f6797dc83a45d4aafbeeae5e9aa	here , our studies show that sars - cov-2-encoded nonstructural protein 13 ( nsp13 ) possesses the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase ( ntpase ) and rna helicase activities that can hydrolyze all types of ntps and unwind rna helices dependently of the presence of ntp , and further characterize the biochemical characteristics of these two enzymatic activities associated with sars - cov-2 nsp13 .
5f6b864972de6f6797dc83a45d4aafbeeae5e9aa	moreover , we found that some bismuth salts could effectively inhibit both the ntpase and rna helicase activities of sars - cov-2 nsp13 in a dose - dependent manner .
5f6b864972de6f6797dc83a45d4aafbeeae5e9aa	thus , our findings demonstrate the ntpase and helicase activities of sars - cov-2 nsp13 , which may play an important role in sars - cov-2 replication and serve as a target for antivirals .

327182e27ac733136b2880cd0084140971270d69	we find that the quantity of information about covid-19 is indeed overwhelming , but that the majority of links shared can not be rated for its credibility .
327182e27ac733136b2880cd0084140971270d69	the majority of links that could be rated came from credible sources ; however , we found a large increase in the proportion of state - sponsored propaganda among non - credible and less credible urls , suggesting that covid-19 may be used as a vector to spread misinformation and disinformation for political purposes .
327182e27ac733136b2880cd0084140971270d69	overall , results indicate that covid-19 is unfolding in a highly uncertain information environment that not may amenable to fact - checking as scientific understanding of the disease , and appropriate public health measures , evolve .

fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	in this study , we elucidated the anti - inflammatory effect of ypfs that is mediated through modulating the expression of three key enzymes involved in ibd : inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( cox-2 ) , and intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( ialp ) .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	in a lipopolysaccharide ( lps)-induced chronic - inflammation model of cultured murine macrophages , ypfs treatment suppressed the activation of inos and cox-2 expression in a dose - dependent manner .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	conversely , application of ypfs in cultured small intestinal enterocytes markedly induced the expression of ialp in a time - dependent manner , which might strengthen the intestinal detoxification system .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	a duality of ypfs in modulating the expression of inos and cox-2 was determined here .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	the expression of inos and cox-2 in macrophages was induced by ypfs , and this activation was partially blocked by the nf - kb - specific inhibitor bay 11 - 7082 , indicating a role of nf - kb signaling .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	these ypfs - induced changes in gene regulation strongly suggest that the anti - inflammatory effects of ypfs are mediated through the regulation of inflammatory enzymes .

0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	we illustrate how high molecular weight cspgs can regulate the exodus of local reactive astrocytes from the main tumor lesion , leading to encapsulation of non - invasive tumor and inhibition of tumor invasion .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	these different cspg conditions also change the spatial profiles of ramified and activated microglia .

0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	the accumulating interstitial pressure and severe tortuosity in the extracellular space within the tumor [ 1 ] due to the high concentration of cspg ecm are a severe limiting factor for efficient delivery of large therapeutic drugs [ 35 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	therefore , lowering the cspg levels by an digestive enzyme was suggested as a way of promoting intratumoral transport of larger therapeutic compounds , making this ecm a potential target for adjuvant therapy
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	for example , tumor growth and invasion was reduced when these ecm molecules were digested by blocking antibodies against versican [ 36 ] or manipulating rna against phosphacan [ 38 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	in oncolytic virus therapy , the diffusion - limiting properties of cspgs are blamed for low therapeutic anti - tumor efficacy due to the inefficient intratumoral spread of oncolytic viruses within the compact glioma [ 40 , 41 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	these cspg conditions also changed the profile of ramified and activated microglia within and outside the tumor .

6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	with increased globalisation comes the likelihood that infectious disease appearing in one country will spread rapidly to another , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) being a recent example .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	however , although sars infected some 10,000 individuals , killing around 1000 , it did not lead to the devastating health impact that many feared , but a rather disproportionate economic impact .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	the disproportionate scale and nature of this impact has caused concern that outbreaks of more serious disease could cause catastrophic impacts on the global economy .

7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	this report demonstrates a heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations in patients affected with covid-19 .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	the most common presenting symptoms are non - specific , so attention should be made on broader testing , especially in age groups with the greatest risk and younger individuals who can serve as carriers of the disease .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir / ritonavir ( in younger age group ) can be potential treatment options .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	finally , patients discharged from the hospital should be followed up because of potential symptom relapse .

162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome contains a small envelope protein , e , with putative involvement in host apoptosis and virus morphogenesis .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	indeed , in a recent study we reported that the a - helical putative transmembrane domain of e protein ( etm ) forms several sds - resistant tm interactions : a dimer , a trimer , and two pentameric forms .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	herein , we have studied multiple isotopically labeled etm peptides reconstituted in model lipid bilayers , using the orientational parameters derived from infrared dichroic data .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	we have independently confirmed that the full polypeptide of e protein can also aggregate as pentamers after expression in escherichia coli .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	the model we report for this pentameric a - helical bundle may explain some of the permabilizing properties of protein e , and should be the basis of mutagenesis efforts in future functional studies .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	background : eps r 7630 is a proprietary aqueous - ethanolic extract from roots of pelargonium sidoides dc and has been demonstrated to dispose among others of antibacterial , antiviral , immunomodulatory , antioxidant , and tissue - protective activity .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	it is an approved medicinal product in more than 50 countries for the treatment of airway infections such as acute bronchitis , common cold , and sinusitis .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	purpose :
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	in the present study antitussive , secretolytic , and anti - inflammatory effects of eps r 7630 were assessed in animal experiments following oral administration at human equivalent doses .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	antitussive effects were evaluated using ammonia - and citric acid - induced models of cough in mice ( 20 , 40 , 120 mg / kg ) and guinea pigs ( 10 , 20 , 45 mg / kg ) , respectively .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	for the determination of secretolytic activity tracheobronchial secretion of intraperitoneally injected phenol red was determined in mice , while antiinflammatory action was assessed in an acute bacterial bronchitis model in rats .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	induction of acute bacterial bronchitis caused characteristic histopathological changes in lung tissue adjacent to trachea and bronchi .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	the degree of these lesions was significantly reduced in rats treated with eps r 7630 at doses of 30 and 60 mg / kg .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	this protective effect at least partially seems to be mediated by an up - regulation of superoxide dismutase and a subsequent protective effect against oxidative stress as indicated by a reduced serum level of malondialdehyde .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	the present data further support the therapeutic use of eps r 7630 in respiratory tract infections and provide a basis for detailed studies on its bioactive constituents as well as their in vivo mode of action .

436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	in this review , i use the term " perpetuation " for persistence of a virus in a population , since this is a different phenomenon from persistence of a virus in an infected host .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	in small populations , viruses such as poliovirus that cause acute infections can not readily be perpetuated , in contrast to viruses such as hepatitis b virus , that cause persistent infections .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	however , small animal populations can turnover significantly each year , permitting the perpetuation of some viruses that cause acute infections .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	large populations of humans are necessary for the perpetuation of acute viruses ; for instance , measles required a population of 500,000 for perpetuation in the pre - measles vaccine era .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	furthermore , if an acute virus , such as poliovirus , exhibits marked seasonality in large populations , then it may disappear during the seasonal trough , even in the presence of a large number of susceptible persons .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	eradication is the converse of perpetuation and can be used as a definitive approach to the control of a viral disease , as in the instance of smallpox .

7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	for this purpose , we have formulated and analysed a metapopulation model in which the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scalefree contact network .
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	the long - distance travellers between the subpopulations will temporarily change the network structure of the destination subpopulation through the " merging effects ( mes ) , " which indicates that the travellers will be regarded as either connected components or isolated nodes in the contact network .
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	the results show that the presence of the mes has constantly accelerated the transmission of the diseases and aggravated the outbreaks compared to the scenario in which the diversity of the long - distance travel types is arbitrarily discarded .

20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	there are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat covid-19 , and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	here , we experimentally determined structural maps of the sars - cov-2 rna genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded rna structures for sars - cov-2 and 6 other coronaviruses .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	importantly , we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep - learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the sars - cov-2 rna genome , none of which were known previously .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	thus , our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus rna biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat covid-19 .

3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	flavivirus methyltransferase is a genetically - validated antiviral target .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	crystal structures of almost all available flavivirus methyltransferases contain s - adenosyl - l - methionine ( sam ) , the methyl donor molecule that co - purifies with the enzymes .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	this raises a possibility that sam is an integral structural component required for the folding of dengue virus ( denv ) methyltransferase .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	here we exclude this possibility by solving the crystal structure of denv methyltransferase without sam .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	the sam ligand was removed from the enzyme through a urea - mediated denaturation - and - renaturation protocol .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	the crystal structure of the sam - depleted enzyme exhibits a vacant sam - binding pocket , with a conformation identical to that of the sam - enzyme co - crystal structure .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	functionally , equivalent enzymatic activities ( n-7 methylation , 2 0 -o methylation , and gmp - enzyme complex formation ) were detected for the sam - depleted and samcontaining recombinant proteins .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	these results clearly indicate that the sam molecule is not an essential component for the correct folding of denv methyltransferase .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	furthermore , the results imply a potential antiviral approach to search for inhibitors that can bind to the sam - binding pocket and compete against sam binding .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	to demonstrate this potential , we have soaked crystals of denv methyltransferase without a bound sam with the natural product sinefungin and show that preformed crystals are capable of binding ligands in this pocket .

d9ce618ef6a804f2fc4c32f5759b340ff16de69c	although cholesterol is an essential component of immune cell membranes , excess levels can dysregulate protective immunity and promote exaggerated pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses .
d9ce618ef6a804f2fc4c32f5759b340ff16de69c	statins block the production of multiple sterols , oxysterols and isoprenoids , resulting in a pleotropic range of context - dependent effects on virus infectivity , immunity and inflammation .
d9ce618ef6a804f2fc4c32f5759b340ff16de69c	we highlight antiviral , immunomodulatory and anti - inflammatory effects of cholesterol - modifying drugs that merit further consideration in the management of sars - cov-2 infection .

ba7a472f2255db20511d7bbc35ab6da48438d913	the covid-19 pandemic has forced governments worldwide to impose movement restrictions on their citizens .

a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	respiratory viruses that emerge in the human population may cause high morbidity and mortality , as well as concern about pandemic spread .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) and novel variants of influenza a virus , such as h5n1 and pandemic h1n1 .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses , but it is not clear which are most suitable .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	therefore , this review compares animal models of sars and influenza , with an emphasis on nonhuman primates , ferrets and cats .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	firstly , the pathology and pathogenesis of sars and influenza are compared .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra - alveolar fibrosis in sars and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in h5n1 influenza .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	secondly , the pathology and pathogenesis of sars and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	host species , host age , route of inoculation , location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	perspectives on the epizootiology of feline enteric coronavirus and the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	this review presents some current thoughts regarding the epizootiology of the feline coronaviruses ; feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) and feline coronavirus ( fecv ) , with primary emphasis on the pathogenesis of these viruses in nature .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	although the mechanism ( s ) whereby fipv causes disease are still incompletely understood , there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of fipv and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	in the case of fipv infection , we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	once oral tolerance is disrupted , fipv is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune - mediated vasculitis and death .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	thus , it may be that clinical forms of fip are due to a combination of two events , the first being the generation of fipv from fecv , and the second being the capacity of fipv to circumvent oral tolerance .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	the covid-19 pandemic has provided many challenges in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	among these is a novel form of coagulopathy that includes exceptionally high levels of d - dimer .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	these spectacularly raised ddimer levels may actually signify the failing attempt of the fibrinolytic system to remove fibrin and necrotic tissue from the lung parenchyma , being consumed or overwhelmed in the process .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	indeed , recent studies suggest that increasing fibrinolytic activity might offer hope for patients with critical disease and severe respiratory failure .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	however , the fibrinolytic system can also be harnessed by coronavirus to promote infectivity and where anti - fibrinolytic measures would also seem appropriate .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	hence , there is a clinical paradox where plasmin formation can be either deleterious or beneficial in covid-19 , but not at the same time .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	the key precursors for p - hydroxybenzoate production by engineered pseudomonas putida s12 are phosphoenolpyruvate ( pep ) and erythrose-4-phosphate ( e4p ) , for which the pentose phosphate ( pp ) pathway is an important source .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	since pp pathway fluxes are typically low in pseudomonads , e4p and pep availability is a likely bottleneck for aromatics production which may be alleviated by stimulating pp pathway fluxes via co - feeding of pentoses in addition to glucose or glycerol .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	as p. putida s12 lacks the natural ability to utilize xylose , the xylose isomerase pathway from e. coli was introduced into the p - hydroxybenzoate producing strain p. putida s12palb2 .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	the initially inefficient xylose utilization was improved by evolutionary selection after which the p - hydroxybenzoate production was evaluated .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	even without xylose - co - feeding , p - hydroxybenzoate production was improved in the evolved xyloseutilizing strain , which may indicate an intrinsically elevated pp pathway activity .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	xylose co - feeding further improved the p - hydroxybenzoate yield when co - fed with either glucose or glycerol , up to 16.3 cmol% ( 0.1 g p - hydroxybenzoate / g substrate ) .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	the yield improvements were most pronounced with glycerol , which probably related to the availability of the pep precursor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ( gap ) .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	thus , it was demonstrated that the production of aromatics such as p - hydroxybenzoate can be improved by co - feeding different carbon sources via different and partially artificial pathways .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	moreover , this approach opens new perspectives for the efficient production of ( fine ) chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulose that typically has a high content of both glucose and xylose and ( crude ) glycerol .

cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	32 male lambs were used in the study and the lambs were divided into 4 groups with 8 lambs in each group .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	in group 4 , lambs with cryptosporidiosis were subjected to normal feeding as control without drug administration .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	clinical examinations of lambs were made before treatment ( day 0 ) and on days 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 after treatment and 5 ml of blood was collected from vena jugularis for blood analysis of all lambs .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	weight changes of lambs were recorded at 0 , 7 , 14 , and 21 days .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	stool specimens were collected pre - treatment ( day 0 ) and on days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 and 21 post - treatment to determine oocyst excretion of lambs with cryptosporidiosis .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	lambs with a mean oocyte counts > 10 after stool examination were included to the treatment .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	weight loss was observed at 7th day according to 0th day the lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis but gradually weight increase was observed at 14th and 21st days and these changes were similar in all groups .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	as a result , in lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis , chitosan oligosaccharide improved in clinical signs and stool character shorter than the positive control group and the administration of chitosan oligosaccharide at doses of 100 , 500 and 1000 mg / kg for 7 days significantly reduced oocyst excretion but not enough to remove cryptosporidiosis completely .

059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	here , we use several experimental paradigms to investigate the pangolin 's use of vision , hearing , and smell to locate food .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	in phase i of this study , we tested the pangolin 's ability to locate food in a two object - choice task by controlling for two of these three sensory modalities and allowing the animal to investigate and choose , using the remaining sensory information , which one of two containers held food .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	in other words , we blocked two types of sensory information coming from the food source and thus from being perceived by the pangolin in order to assess whether it was able to use the remaining information alone to find the food .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	in phase ii , we developed two novel olfaction tasks to investigate whether or not the pangolin was using distant or proximal prey odors to find food .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	although there is little known about how pangolins locate food in their environments , our own observations of the pangolin 's use of its pronounced snout led us to predict that olfaction would be their dominant sensory modality when foraging .

2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	virus metagenomics is a young research filed but it has already transformed our understanding of virus diversity and evolution , and illuminated at a new level the connections between virus evolution and the evolution and ecology of the hosts .
2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	in this review article , we examine the new picture of the evolution of rna viruses , the dominant component of the eukaryotic virome , that is emerging from metagenomic data analysis .
2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	the major expansion of many groups of rna viruses through metagenomics allowed the construction of substantially improved phylogenetic trees for the conserved virus genes , primarily , the rna - dependent rna polymerases ( rdrp ) .

2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	comparison of the genome architectures of rna viruses discovered by metagenomics and by traditional methods reveals an extent of gene module shuffling among diverse virus genomes that far exceeds the previous appreciation of this evolutionary phenomenon .
2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	most dramatically , inclusion of the metagenomic data in phylogenetic analyses of the rdrp resulted in the identification of numerous , strongly supported groups that encompass rna viruses from diverse hosts including different groups of protists , animals and plants .

4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	in this projection exercise , we analyzed the circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic in bangladesh and used multiple methods to characterize the epidemic curve .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	we merged several publicly available data sets for the purpose .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	our estimates indicate prevalence of covid-19 may be between 200,000 and 600,000 towards end of the year , may take 9 months ( 270 days ) to flatten the epidemic curve , lifting of the lockdown may have increased total cases by 60 to 100 % and may have prolonged the epidemic by additional 2 - 3 months .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	most infected with covid-19 do not show any symptoms and those that do have fever , cough , fatigue , slight dyspnoea , sore throat , headache and conjunctivitis ( 4 ) .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	a further 5 % may experience life threatening condition such as respiratory failure and multiorgan failure .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	thus , case fatality rate , defined as percentage of infected patients who may die , for covid-19 range from 2 - 5 % and this percentage increases with age and for those with chronic comorbid conditions such as diabetes , asthma and heart disease .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	thus spread of covid-19 in bangladesh poses a significant threat ; and without active intervention by government , even if a small percentage of the population , say 5 % , are infected , this translates to 8,000,000 needing hospitalization and over 200,000 deaths .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	observing the spread and potential significant health effects , many researchers estimated potential impact of covid-19 pandemic to help policy makers prepare respective countries and their systems to face this pandemic .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	the main thrust of these estimations has been to encourage policy makers to implement strong non - pharmaceutical intervention ( npi ) such as social distancing , hand hygiene and wearing of face masks , self quarantining , all to reduce the potential spread of the pandemic ( 6 ) .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	research has also found that testing and isolating or quarantining infected persons may mitigate the spread of the infection ( 7 ) .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	subsequent studies focused on the impact of npi on the spread of the disease .

c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	impact of air pollution on educational attainment for respiratory health treated students : a cross sectional data linkage study abstract introduction
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	there is some evidence that exam results are worse when students are acutely exposed to air pollution .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	studies investigating the association between air pollution and academic attainment have been constrained by small sample sizes .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	cross sectional educational attainment data ( 2009 -2015 ) from students aged 15 - 16 years in cardiff , wales were linked to primary health care data , modelled air pollution and measured pollen data , and analysed using multilevel linear regression models .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	annual cohort , school and individual level confounders were adjusted for in single and multipollutant / pollen models .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	we stratified by treatment of asthma and/or seasonal allergic rhinitis ( sar ) .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	-0.079 , -0.008 ) reduction of standardised capped point score ( cps ) after adjusting for individual and household risk factors for 18,241 students .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	this association remained statistically significant after controlling for other pollutants and pollen .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	there was no association of pm 2.5 , o 3 , or pollen with standardised cps remaining after adjustment .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	we found no evidence that treatment for asthma or sar modified the observed no 2 effect on educational attainment .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	our study showed that short - term exposure to traffic - related air pollution , specifically no 2 , was associated with detrimental educational attainment for students aged 15 - 16 .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	air pollution estimates for home and school locations were linked to individual outcomes short term exposure to no 2 was associated with lower educational attainment treatment for asthma or hayfever did not modify the effect of pollution on educational attainment
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	health inequality considerations should be included in proposed air quality policies
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	the coronavirus disease 2019
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	( covid-19 ) pandemic presents major challenges to places of detention , including secure forensic hospitals .
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	international guidance presents a range of approaches to assist in decreasing the risk of covid-19 outbreaks as well as responses to manage outbreaks of infection should they occur .
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	we describe the evolution of a covid-19 outbreak in our own facility , and the design , and staffing of a forensic isolation unit .
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	we experienced outbreaks of covid-19 on two secure forensic units with 13 patients and 10 staff becoming positive .
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	forensic secure settings present major challenges as some proposals for pandemic management such as decarceration or early release are not possible , and facilities may present challenges to achieve sustained social distancing .
f7284aa17e76827de5ba8edcd1e89acf2a63f9c2	the devastating spread of the novel coronavirus , named covid-19 , starting its journey from wuhan province of china on january 21 st , 2020 , has now threatened lives of almost all the countries of the world in different magnitudes .
f7284aa17e76827de5ba8edcd1e89acf2a63f9c2	mostly the developed countries have been hit hard , besides the emerging countries like china , india and brazil .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	major effort has been spent on improving oxygenation in acute respiratory failure .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	a sepsis - like condition was created by continuous infusion of lipopolysacharide , lps , and the pigs were followed for 6 hours .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	99tc - labelled red blood cells were used as an intra - vascular marker and 111in - labelled transferrin as an intra - and extravascular marker of abdominal fluid as detected by gamma - camera technique .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	lps caused a three - to - eight fold increase in the rate of ascites formation and abdominal organ swelling .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	mechanical ventilation ( mv ) with a low level of end - expiratory airway pressure ( peep of 5 cmh2o ) increased abdominal fluid formation by 10 % compared to spontaneous breathing ( sb ) .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	mv with peep of 15 cm h2o caused a significant rise by 80 % compared to sb ( p < 0.01 ) and also liver swelling .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	with the double isotope technique , abdominal edema formation can be followed continuously in experimental conditions .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	the findings suggest that the most commonly used techniques of improving oxygenation in acute respiratory failure worsen abdominal fluid balance with organ swelling and increased ascites .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	we asked how structured and free - text narrative emr data should be combined to improve epidemic surveillance for acute respiratory infections ( ari ) .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	eight previously characterized ari case detection algorithms ( cda ) were applied to historical emr entries to create authentic time series of daily ari case counts ( background ) .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	an epidemic model simulated influenza cases ( injection ) .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	for each cda , we plotted the detection delay as a function of far or caseload , over a broad range of alarm thresholds .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	results : cdas that combined text analyses seeking ari symptoms in clinical notes with provider - assigned diagnostic codes in order to maximize the precision rather than the sensitivity of case - detection lowered detection delay at any given far or caseload .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	an empiric approach can guide the integration of emr data into case - detection methods that improve both the timeliness and efficiency of epidemic detection .

a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	in a cross - sectional study , 110 women in late gestation who included 36 cmv infected cases and 74 cmv uninfected , age and hiv status matched controls were enrolled .
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 genes which code for proteins involved in immunity against cmv were genotyped using iplex gold
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	the cytopathic effects of zika virus ( zikv ) are poorly characterized .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	innate immunity controls zikv infection and disease in most infected patients through mechanisms that remain to be understood .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	here , we studied the morphological cellular changes induced by zikv and addressed the role of interferon - induced transmembrane proteins ( ifitm ) , a family of broad - spectrum antiviral factors , during viral replication .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	we further show that zikv - induced vacuoles are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) and dependent on the pi3k / akt signaling axis .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	our results provide mechanistic insight behind the zikv - induced cytopathic effect and indicate that ifitm3 , by acting as a gatekeeper for incoming virus , restricts virus takeover of the er and subsequent cell death .
23fa4477a0f945ac46e749d9efa1396d34a6f963	the exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date .
23fa4477a0f945ac46e749d9efa1396d34a6f963	the relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined , which is affected by environmental conditions , human behaviour , the host and the microorganism .

170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	emerging infectious diseases are considered as a pressing challenge to global public health .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	throughout public health response to emerging infectious diseases , emergency nurses are situated at the forefront of the healthcare system .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	the present study has explored emergency nurses ' perceptions regarding the risks appraisal of the threat of the emerging infectious disease situation in emergency department context .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	a purposive sampling method was employed to recruit emergency nurses who worked in public hospitals in hong kong .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	five overarching themes emerged from the data : ( 1 ) the novelty of an emerging infectious disease , ( 2 ) the severity of an emerging infectious disease , ( 3 ) the proximity to an emerging infectious disease , ( 4 ) the complexity of an emerging infectious disease situation , and ( 5 ) the response levels towards an emerging infectious disease situation .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	background social distancing - when people limit close contact with others outside their household - is a primary intervention available to combat the covid-19 pandemic .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	the importance of social distancing is unlikely to change until effective treatments or vaccines become widely available .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	however , relatively little is known about how best to promote social distancing .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	purpose we examined whether one type of social distancing behavior - reduced movement outside the homewas associated with conventional health behaviors .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	counties with healthier behaviors - particularly less obesity and greater physical activity - evidenced greater reduction in movement outside the home during the initial phases of the pandemic in the usa .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	existing scientific literature on health behavior and health behavior change can be more confidently used to promote social distancing behaviors during the covid-19 pandemic .
3be0f1df3128b8596f72524dcc4fb0d061a7c701	a total of 575 videos were found , of which 202 videos were included and analysed using the lap - vegas guidelines .

52b8e012ccee7d546617d7642d9f232bccfb49fe	live poultry traders ( lpts ) have greater risk to avian influenza due to occupational exposure to poultry .
52b8e012ccee7d546617d7642d9f232bccfb49fe	this study investigated knowledge , attitudes and practices of lpts relating to influenza a ( h7n9 ) .
52b8e012ccee7d546617d7642d9f232bccfb49fe	hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with preventive practices and attitudes towards various control measures implemented in live poultry markets against h7n9 .
52b8e012ccee7d546617d7642d9f232bccfb49fe	results : only 46.1 % of the respondents recognized risks associated with contacts with bird secretions or droppings , and only 22.9 % perceived personally " likely / very likely " to contract h7n9 infection .
52b8e012ccee7d546617d7642d9f232bccfb49fe	around 60 % of the respondents complied with hand - washing and wearing gloves , and only 20 % reported wearing face masks .
52b8e012ccee7d546617d7642d9f232bccfb49fe	only 16.3 % of the respondents agreed on introducing central slaughtering of poultry .
52b8e012ccee7d546617d7642d9f232bccfb49fe	being younger , involving in slaughtering poultry , having longer working hours , less access to h7n9-related information and poorer knowledge , and perceiving lower personal susceptibility to h7n9 infection were negatively associated with preventive practices .
f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	currently , the emergence of a novel human coronavirus , sars - cov-2 , has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans .
f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	human - to - human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2 - 10 days , facilitating its spread via droplets , contaminated hands or surfaces .
f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	we therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection , e.g. in healthcare facilities .
f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	the analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses ( hcov ) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal , glass or plastic for up to 9 days , but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62e71 % ethanol , 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide or 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute .
f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	other biocidal agents such as 0.05e0.2 % benzalkonium chloride or 0.02 % chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective .
f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	as no specific therapies are available for sars - cov-2 , early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	the gut microbiome is closely associated with the health of the host ; although the interaction between the bacterial microbiome and the whole virome has rarely been studied , it is likely of medical importance .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	examination of the interactions between the gut bacterial microbiome and virome of rhesus monkey would significantly contribute to revealing the gut microbiome composition .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	here , we conducted a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome of rhesus monkeys in a longitudinal cohort treated with an antibiotic cocktail , and we documented the interactions between the bacterial microbiome and virome .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	we also detected changes in the gut metabolome by gc - ms and lc - ms .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	furthermore , the abundance - based coverage estimator ( ace ) decreased from 104.47 to 33.84 , and the abundance of eukaryotic viruses also changed substantially .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	in the annotation , 6 families of dna viruses and 1 bacteriophage family were present in the normal monkeys but absent after gut bacterial microbiome depletion .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	intriguingly , we discovered that changes in the gut bacterial microbiome composition may promote changes in the gut virome composition , and tryptophan , arginine , and quinone may play roles in the interaction between the bacterial microbiome and virome .

7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	although most autoimmune diseases are considered to be cd4 t cell - or antibody - mediated , many respond to cd20-depleting antibodies that have limited influence on cd4 and plasma cells .

7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	as such , drug - induced b cell subset inhibition , that controls at least some autoimmunities , would not influence innate and cd8 t cell responses , which are central to sars - cov-2 elimination , nor the hypercoagulation and innate inflammation causing severe morbidity .
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	this is supported clinically , as the majority of sars - cov-2-infected , cd20depleted people with autoimmunity have recovered .
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	however , protective neutralizing antibody and vaccination responses are predicted to be blunted until naive b cells repopulate , based on b cell repopulation kinetics and vaccination responses , from published rituximab and unpublished ocrelizumab ( nct00676715 , nct02545868 )
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	this suggests that it may be possible to undertake dose interruption to maintain inflammatory disease control , while allowing effective vaccination against sars - cov-29 , if and when an effective vaccine is available .

2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	we perform the analysis with 4 different models and we think that the best candidate to correctly described the italian situation is a generalized logistic equation .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	this choice is due to the fact that in italy the pharyngeal swabs are made only to severe infected , therefore we have no information about asymptomatic people .

2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) was reported to who as an outbreak in wuhan city , hubei province , china on end of 2019 , afterwards epidemic in many countries , and pandemic on the worldwide in 2020 .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	usually detection of coronavirus including sars - cov-2 was detected by real - time rt - pcr method , but it must be long time that rna is treated by extraction , concentration and purification , and detected by rt - pcr method .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	in another point of the evaluations , surprisingly , human coronavirus 229e , which was substituted for sars - cov-2 , could be detected in crude state without treatment in advance of rna .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	as that was , it was possible to detect coronavirus with direct rt - pcr .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	therefore , it might eliminate wasteful time , avoid secondary infection and risk of contamination .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	in light of the above two points , sars - cov-2 might be detected more quickly and more simply .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	with using this mobile real - time pcr , these methods should be suitable for not only sars - cov-2 but also other various viruses and might save time compared to earlier detection methods .

b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	coronavirus spike ( s ) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies .
b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	we show that sars - cov-2 s uses ace2 to enter cells and that the receptor - binding domains of sars - cov-2 s and sars - cov s bind with similar affinities to human ace2 , correlating with the efficient spread of sars - cov-2 among humans .
b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	we found that the sars - cov-2 s glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the s 1 /s 2 subunits , which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from sars - cov and sars - related covs .
b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	we determined cryo - em structures of the sars - cov-2 s ectodomain trimer , providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry .
b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	finally , we demonstrate that sars - cov s murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited sars - cov-2 s mediated entry into cells , indicating that cross - neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved s epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination .

6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	virus h5n1 causes multi - organ disease and death in poultry , resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	in addition , it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high ( 60 % ) mortality rate .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	effective vaccination against hpai h5n1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird - to - bird and bird - to - human transmission .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	in the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin ( sh5 3 ) produced in mammalian cells .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	it was shown to protect chickens , in a dosedependent manner , against a lethal challenge with h5n1 after a single vaccination .

6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	also in mice , vaccination with sh5 3 provided complete protection against challenge with hpai h5n1 .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	conclusions / significance : our results demonstrate that sh5 3 constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against hpai h5n1 .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	as these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time , they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses .

3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	: the index patient acquired sars - cov-2 in italy and after his return to hamburg transmitted 36 it to 2 out of 132 contacts .
3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	virus genomics and variant pattern clearly confirms the initial local cluster .
3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	42 conclusions : sars - cov-2 variant tracing highlights both , low infection dose transmissions suggestive 43 of fomites as route of infection in the initial cluster and high and low infection dose transmissions in 44 family clusters indicative of fomites and droplets as infection routes .
3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	this suggests ( 1 ) single viral 45 particle infection can be sufficient to initiate sars - cov-2 infection and ( 2 ) household / family members 46 are exposed to high virus loads and therefore have a high risk to acquire sars - cov-2 .

255e05f7b489ece5c5c60fdf312ba0a3dcffeb37	throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza - like illness were examined using real - time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus - specific primers , and then virus - positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products .
255e05f7b489ece5c5c60fdf312ba0a3dcffeb37	hcov - nl63 infection was identified in 8.4 % ( 9/107 ) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia , but not found in outpatients with influenza - like illness .
255e05f7b489ece5c5c60fdf312ba0a3dcffeb37	age distribution of hcov - nl63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16e25 years ( 20 % ) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups , and exhibited a similar age - specific pattern to influenza a / h1n1 infection , but not influenza a / h3n2 and b infections in hospitalized patients .
f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	with the multiplication of covid-19 cases due to sars cov2 , some concerns about angiotensinconverting enzyme 1 ( ace1 ) inhibitors ( acei ) and angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers ( arb ) have emerged .
f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	because sars cov2 utilizes ace2 ( angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ) as a membrane receptor to enter target cells , the fear that acei or arb might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of covid-19 infection emerged .
f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	ace2 is a membrane - bound enzyme ( carboxypeptidase ) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin ii and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin ii effects .
c8474dbf9fe0d54fd47cf9382296536fb52f1efe	the current pandemic sars - cov-2 virus has required an unusual allocation of resources that can negatively impact of chronically ill patients and high - complexity procedures .

c8474dbf9fe0d54fd47cf9382296536fb52f1efe	we conducted a survey to investigate the impact of the covid-19 outbreak on pediatric transplant activity and healthcare practices in both solid organ transplantation ( sot ) and hematopoietic stem cell ( hsct ) transplantation .
c8474dbf9fe0d54fd47cf9382296536fb52f1efe	additionally , a total of 14 covid-19 pediatric transplanted patients were identified at the time of the survey , including eight transplant recipients and six candidates for transplantation .
c8474dbf9fe0d54fd47cf9382296536fb52f1efe	these survey results demonstrate the limitations in healthcare resources for pediatric transplantation patients during early stages of this pandemic .
c8474dbf9fe0d54fd47cf9382296536fb52f1efe	covid-19 disease is a major worldwide challenge for the field of pediatric transplantation , where there will be a need for systematic data collection , encouraging regular discussions to address the long - term consequences for pediatric transplantation candidates , recipients and their families .

db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	effective treatment interventions for childhood obesity involve parents , are multicomponent and use behavior change strategies , but more information is needed on the mechanisms influencing behavioral outcomes and the type of parental involvement that is efficacious in behavioral treatment interventions with school - age children .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	this review aimed to understand key characteristics of programs that contribute to dietary and physical activity behavioral outcomes , and through which key mechanisms .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	this was a systematic review with narrative synthesis following prisma guidelines and realist analysis using rameses guidelines to explain outcome patterns and influence of parental involvement .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	these characteristics were associated with positive dietary and physical activity behavior change in children and may be useful considerations for the design and implementation of future theory - based treatment interventions to encourage habitual healthy diet and physical activity to reduce childhood obesity .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	recommend prevention and treatment of obesity in the primary school years should focus on parents , since this is when life habits are formed [ 9 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	whilst plenty of recent studies support evidence that parents exert high influence over energy balance behaviors in their children , making their involvement key to the success of child weight - management programs [ 10 , 11 ] , findings have varied on the extent and for what ages parental involvement is successful [ 12 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	many authors have acknowledged the importance of parental involvement in childhood obesity treatment interventions and positive health - related outcomes .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	some interventions have focused on parents as the exclusive agents of change [ 15 , 16 ] , where key elements consist of strengthening parents ' leadership skills , to take the focus off children being identified as the ( obese ) patient and overcome associated negative psychological issues and resistance to change .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	other studies have promoted parent support of the child 's behavior change [ 16 , 17 ] , with parents responsible for creating a supportive environment and empowering children to make informed choices .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	in the past decade , systematic reviews of child and family - focused treatment interventions targeting obesity - related behavior change in overweight children have indicated small positive short - term outcomes on dietary and physical activity behaviors [ 5 , 24 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	however , high heterogeneity across included studies ( varied methodologies , settings , and intervention strategies ) has been common to most systematic reviews , limiting the applicability of the findings and providing insufficient evidence for policy relevance or to support upscaling [ 5 , 25 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	overall , a better understanding is needed of patterns of outcomes across the family - based literature , and how the interaction between different program characteristics and behavior change strategies influence lifestyle behaviors such as heathy eating and physical activity in overweight and obese children .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	as a result , realist reviews are emerging as an alternative ' theory - driven ' approach to systematic reviews in public health research , as they are particularly relevant for understanding complex multicomponent interventions such as those prioritizing childhood obesity .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	however , there are currently no realist reviews on family - based behavior change interventions for overweight and obese children , measuring multiple obesity - related behavioral lifestyle outcomes and focusing on parental involvement .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	this review aimed to enrich understanding of the ways child - focused behavior change treatment interventions contribute to reported obesity - related behavioral outcomes ( specifically diet and physical activity behavioral outcomes as opposed to interventions based on healthy eating and physical activity behaviors for preventing obesity ) and the influence of specific program characteristics and mechanisms .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	the overall objective was to understand the key characteristics of programs that contribute to positive dietary and physical activity behavioral outcomes , and through which key mechanisms .

d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	we systematically review the literature on anthropogenic luc and zoonotic diseases , highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens , and identifying avenues for future research .
d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification , carnivores with urbanisation and helminths , bats with deforestation and viruses , and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa .
d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by luc .
d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	the behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed , impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans .
d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic luc requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread .
d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	the link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent covid-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic luc affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals .
02e0f1d2899187c3b0b9b9de45c5097c880a0c76	we here developed a new tool for analyzing virus - transcribed mrnas , not virus copy numbers , in the data of conventional and single - cell rna - sequencing of human cells .
02e0f1d2899187c3b0b9b9de45c5097c880a0c76	our pipeline , named virtus ( viral transcript usage sensor ) , was able to detect 763 viruses including herpesviruses , retroviruses , and even sars - cov-2 ( covid-19 ) , and quantify their transcripts in the sequence data .
02e0f1d2899187c3b0b9b9de45c5097c880a0c76	this tool thus enabled simultaneously detecting infected cells , the composition of multiple viruses within the cell , and the endogenous host gene expression profile of the cell .
02e0f1d2899187c3b0b9b9de45c5097c880a0c76	this bioinformatics method would be instrumental in addressing the possible effects of covertly infecting viruses on certain diseases and developing new treatments to target such viruses .
2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	up to 70 % of sars - cov-2 infections in working - and school - age people are asymptomatic ( poletti et al . , 2020 ) , creating anxiety over reopening workplaces and schools around the world .
2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	in the absence of effective treatments or a vaccine , peace of mind will come only with community - based sars - cov-2 screening , where many people are tested on a regular basis .
2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	here , we describe an rt - lamp test for sars - cov-2 in raw saliva that takes about 45 minutes from sample to answer and requires only simple equipment ( pipettes and a heating source ) .
2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	the assay has a limit of detection of 100 virions per microliter , and targets two separate regions of the sars - cov-2 genome .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the covid-19 pandemic is controversial , though increasingly recommended , and the potential of this intervention is not well understood .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	we develop a compartmental model for assessing the communitywide impact of mask use by the general , asymptomatic public , a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	model simulations , using data relevant to covid-19 dynamics in the us states of new york and washington , suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of covid-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	moreover , mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness ( as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked ) and coverage rate ( as a fraction of the general population ) , while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes ( death , hospitalizations ) is highly nonlinear , indicating masks could synergize with other non - pharmaceutical measures .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	notably , masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	the transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 was previously identified as the essential protease that can cleave hemagglutinin of many subtypes of influenza virus and spike protein of coronavirus .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	herein , we found that a guanine rich tract , capable of forming intramolecular g - quadruplex in the presence of potassium ions , in the promoter region of human tmprss2 gene was quite important for gene transcriptional activity , hence affecting its function .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	more importantly , compounds can down - regulate tmprss2 gene expression , especially endogenous tmprss2 protein levels , and consequently suppress influenza a virus propagation in vitro .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	our results provide a new strategy for anti - influenza a virus infection by small molecules targeting the tmprss2 gene g - quadruplex and thus inhibiting tmprss2 expression , which is valuable for developing small molecule drugs against influenza a virus and also may be a potential candidate as anti - sars - cov-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome cov 2 ) lead molecules .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	the cleavage of ha0 is a necessary step for influenza virus to be contagious , as it liberates the fusion peptide which can insert into target membranes during fusion .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	on the other hand , the cleavage leads ha to be in a metastable conformation that can undergo the structural rearrangements required for fusion in endosome environment .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	however , iav has no ha0 processing protease ,
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	accumulating evidences suggest that , tmprss2 , a type ii transmembrane serine protease , is responsible for ha0 proteolytic cleavage of many subtype iavs which contain a single arginine in the linker peptide between ha1 and ha2 , such as h1n1 ( a / pr/8/34 ) and h7n9 ( a / anhui/1/13 ) 6,7 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	in animal models , tmprss2 deficiency protects mice against h1n1 ( a / pr/8/34 ) , mouse - adapted h1n1 ( a / california/04/09 ) and h7n9 ( a/ anhui/1/13 ) influenza a virus infections 6,7 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	genetic variants with higher tmprss2 expression confer higher risk to severe h1n1 ( pdm09 ) and asian h7n9 influenza a virus 8 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	in addition , more recently , it is reported that tmprss2 can help sars - cov-2 for entry into host cells through entailing s protein cleavage 10 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	the critical role in iav and sars - cov-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome cov 2 ) infection and the nonvital physiological function of tmprss2 highlight an antiviral strategy that targets tmprss2 and inspire us to find small molecules that can inhibit iav and sars - cov-2 infection via " chemical knockout " of tmprss2 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	next , we designed and synthesized a series of benzoselenoxanthene derivatives and found that these compounds can induce the formation of and stabilize the g - quadruplex structure in the guanine - rich tract , causing down - regulation of tmprss2 expression and finally resulted in a reduction of influenza a virus ( a/ pr8/34 ) titers in vitro .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	our findings suggest that inhibiting tmprss2 expression by g - quadruplex stabilization in tmprss2 promoter is a potential strategy for iav infection therapy and novel benzoselenoxanthene derivatives own a potential as drugs against iav infection .

633e89365f800d4e5c888ad2e2d8e580a7843065	partial genome fragment analysis indicated that mammarenavirus and hantavirus strains had more than 90 % and 99 % nucleic acid identity with cardamones virus and seoul virus , respectively , which cause diseases in humans .
633e89365f800d4e5c888ad2e2d8e580a7843065	although the present hev strains identified are typically found worldwide , phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a divergence of 16 % .
633e89365f800d4e5c888ad2e2d8e580a7843065	to our knowledge , the present work is the first report of the prevalence of mammarenavirus , hantaviruses , and rat hev strains in rodents and shrews from shenzhen city , china .
633e89365f800d4e5c888ad2e2d8e580a7843065	our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of rodent - and shrew - borne mammarenavirus and hantavirus , and the biodiversity of rat hev isolates in shenzhen city .

7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	we then used these rna transcript standards , full - length sars - cov-2 rna , and rna - spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer - probe sets .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	we show that all primer - probe sets can be used to detect sars - cov-2 , but there are clear differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives with low amounts of virus .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	adding to this , many primer - probe sets , including the " n2 " and " n3 " sets issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention , have background amplification with sars - cov-2-negative nasopharyngeal swabs , which may lead to inconclusive results .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	our findings characterize the limitations of commonly used primer - probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of sars - cov-2 .

22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	we propose prophylactic with low molecular weigth heparin ( lmwh ) not only in those cases in which the oocyte recovery has been performed , but also in those in which the cancellation has been decided .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	acute gastroenteritis accounts for a significant burden of medically attended illness in children under the age of five .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	for this study , four multiplex reverse transcription pcr assays were used to determine the incidence of adenovirus , astrovirus , coronavirus , norovirus gi and gii , rotavirus , and sapovirus in stool samples submitted for viral electron microscopy ( em ) to the children 's hospital colorado .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	of 1105 stool samples available , viral rna / dna was detected in 247 ( 26.2 % ) of 941 pediatric samples ( median age ¼ 2.97 years , 54 % male ) with 28 ( 3.0 % ) positive for more than one virus .

d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	fibroblast growth factor 2 ( fgf2 ) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	1 -acid glycoprotein ( fagp ) increases during feline infectious peritonitis ( fip ) .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	in this work we describe the tissue distribution of fagprp during fip , and its relationship with feline coronavirus ( fcov ) and myeloid cells .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	tissues from five control cats and from 15 cats with fip were examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against human agp , fcov and myeloid antigens .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	diffuse fagprp positivity within the lesions , likely due to vascular plasma leakage , endothelial and epithelial lining were detectable .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	compared to controls , fagprp - expressing cells often increased in number and were diffusely distributed in lymph nodes , as usually occurs for igm - producing plasma cells during early immune responses .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	these findings did not depend on the presence of fcovs or of myeloid cells , suggesting that fagprp is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of fip .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	astrocytes isolated from the brain of newborn lewis rats and an astrocytic cell line were susceptible to infection with the neurotropic borna disease virus in vitro .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	since astrocytes also have been found to be infected in vivo it seemed appropriate to test this cell type for interaction with a borna disease virus - specific cd 4 + t cell line .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	borna disease virus - infected astrocytes were found to be capable of presenting virus - specific antigen to virus - specific t cells in vitro .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	however , the response was significantly enhanced if the purified 38/39 kda borna disease virus - specific protein was added exogenously to the cultures .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	beside the function as antigen - presenting cells for various antigens including virus - specific protein and myelin basic protein , persistently infected astrocytes were also found to act as target cells for a cd 4 + t cell line as shown in conventional 51cr release assays after induction of mhc class ii expression by gamma interferon .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	it could be shown that the ability of cd 4 + bdv - specific t cells to mediate lysis was in part dependent on the stage of activation .

aec19b12e4415f849724104d63b8c9990ad88d11	issues regarding cabin air quality and the potential risks of transmission of respiratory infections during flight have been investigated and debated previously , but , with the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza outbreaks , these issues have recently taken on heightened importance .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	this study employed a multi - component eulerian - lagrangian approach to model the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets in quiescent air .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	the computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) computations based on the approach achieved a satisfactory agreement with the theoretical models reported in the literature .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	the results demonstrated that the evaporation - generated vapor and super - saturated wet air exhaled from the respiratory tracks forms a " vapor plume " in front of the respiratory track opening , which , despite the short life time , significantly impedes the evaporation of the droplets captured in it .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	the study also revealed that due to the droplet size reduction induced by evaporation , both the number density of airborne droplets and mass concentration of inhalable pathogens remarkably increased , which can result in a higher risk of infection .
36abdfdc52ca14f4c2a8b6105d03b5734bd568da	the widespread antigenic changes lead to the emergence of a new type of coronavirus ( cov ) called as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars)-cov-2 that is immunologically different from the previous circulating species .
36abdfdc52ca14f4c2a8b6105d03b5734bd568da	angiotensin - converting enzyme-2 ( ace-2 ) is one of the most important receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells ( hcs ) which its interaction with spike protein ( sp ) with a furincleavage site results in the sars - cov-2 invasion .
36abdfdc52ca14f4c2a8b6105d03b5734bd568da	furthermore , we discussed that the small molecular inhibitors can limit the interaction of ace-2 and furin with sp and can be used as potential therapeutic platforms to combat the spreading cov epidemic .
36abdfdc52ca14f4c2a8b6105d03b5734bd568da	in conclusion , this review may pave the way for providing useful information about different compounds involved in improving the effectiveness of cov vaccine or drugs with minimum toxicity against human health .
d6581ad9edc5425dc84c79a81854e113ca5c8fb2	human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) is one of the four major viral pathogens associated with acute respiratory tract infections ( ari ) and creates a substantial burden of disease , particularly in young children ( < 5 years ) and older individuals ( ≥65 years ) .

e494ed8c504a8312c9df7936a8fc832e86d444e6	it is therefore important to know the tick population and distribution in our environment and wild animals in order to prevent tick - borne diseases .
e494ed8c504a8312c9df7936a8fc832e86d444e6	the ticks collected in the city were reported as potential vectors of pathogens , such as rickettsiosis .
e494ed8c504a8312c9df7936a8fc832e86d444e6	although their pathogenicity for animals including humans is still unclear , it is important to stay alert and pay attention to tick - borne diseases in order to ensure the safety of the citizens of the city as well as that of visitors .

39a1163f47ecb0d167b9e051ebc69814bb7676ea	here , we describe recent findings demonstrating that nanotrap particles are able to capture live infectious virus , viral rna , and viral proteins .
789a0e42916a7a3def358f13234df2c6ebeb8c0e	porcine parvovirus ( ppv ) is one of the major causes of reproductive pig disease .
789a0e42916a7a3def358f13234df2c6ebeb8c0e	the optimized lamp program was as follows :
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	twenty - four field isolates of transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) were isolated and examined for antigenic and biological characteristics .
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	most tgev isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect ( cpe ) in swine testis ( st ) cell culture , which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected ceils from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident .
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	minor variations in cpe were observed with one isolate , ia-145 .
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	the tgev isolate ia-101 presented a higher molecular mass m protein and lacked an n protein doublet that was present in all other tgev isolates .
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	the tgev isolates were shown to be closely related antigenically by using hyperimmune sera in a virus neutralization ( vn ) test .
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	titers of the mabs were highest with the homologous miller tgev , and one virus isolate , ia-156 , was very poorly neutralized with the mabs used in this study .
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	indirect immunofluorescence assay ( ifa ) results were similar to those obtained by the vn test .
ad790c4948a1a7bb32754b5cf67158bdc0ff8907	viruses of lower vertebrates recently became a ® eld of interest to the public due to increasing epizootics and economic losses of poikilothermic animals .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	sars - cov-2 , a member of the coronavirus family , has caused a global public health emergency .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	based on our analysis of hepatitis c virus and coronavirus replication , and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors , we previously reasoned that the fda - approved heptatitis c drug epclusa ( sofosbuvir / velpatasvir ) should inhibit coronaviruses , including sars - cov-2 .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	here , using model polymerase extension experiments , we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of sofosbuvir is incorporated by low - fidelity polymerases and sars - cov rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) , and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases ; the activated triphosphate form of sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host - like high - fidelity dna polymerase .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	using the same molecular insight , we selected two other anti - viral agents , alovudine and azt ( an fda approved hiv / aids drug ) for evaluation as inhibitors of sars - cov rdrp .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	we demonstrate the ability of two hiv reverse transcriptase inhibitors , 3'fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate ( the active triphosphate forms of alovudine and azt ) , to be incorporated by sars - cov rdrp where they also terminate further polymerase extension .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	given the 98 % amino acid similarity of the sars - cov and sars - cov-2 rdrps , we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the sars - cov-2 polymerase .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	these results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad - spectrum anticoronavirus agents .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the recent appearance of a new coronaviral infection , covid-19 , in wuhan , china , and its worldwide spread , has made international headlines .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	already more than 3,000 deaths have been ascribed to this virus , and covid-19 has reached near pandemic status .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia , sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the virus , designated sars - cov-2 , is a new member of the subgenus sarbecovirus , in the orthocoronavirinae subfamily , but is distinct from mers - cov and sars - cov. 1
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the coronaviruses are single strand rna viruses , sharing properties with other single - stranded rna viruses such as hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) , west nile virus , marburg virus , hiv virus , ebola virus , dengue virus , and rhinoviruses .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	in particular , coronaviruses and hcv are both positive - sense single - strand rna viruses , 3,4 and thus have a similar replication mechanism requiring a rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the coronavirus life cycle has been described .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	briefly , the virus enters the cell by endocytosis , is uncoated , and orf1a and orf1b of the positive strand rna is translated to produce nonstructural protein precursors , including a cysteine protease and a serine protease ; these further cleave the precursors to form mature , functional helicase and rna - dependent rna polymerase .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	most assays available for testing proteolytical activity of proteases are performed in vitro , using heterologously expressed proteases and peptide substrates .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	to deal with the disadvantages associated with in vitro assays , we modified a cell - based protease assay for picornavirus proteases .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	the assay is based on the induction of expression of a firefly luciferase reporter by a chimeric transcription factor in which the viral protease and cleavage sites are inserted between the gal4 binding domain and the vp16 activation domain .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	firefly luciferase expression is dependent on cleavage of the transcription factor by the viral protease .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	we designed the assay for 3c proteases ( 3c pro ) of various enteroviruses as well as of viruses of several other picornavirus genera , and show that the assay is amenable for use in a high - throughput setting .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	furthermore , we show that the spectrum of activity of 3c pro inhibitor ag7088 ( rupintrivir ) not only encompasses enterovirus 3c pro but also 3c pro of foot - and - mouth disease virus ( fmdv ) , an aphthovirus .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	in contrary , ag7404 ( compound 1 ) , an analogue of ag7088 , had no effect on fmdv 3c pro activity , for which we provide a structural explanation .

e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	antisense antimicrobial therapeutics are synthetic oligomers that silence expression of specific genes .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	this specificity confers an advantage over broad - spectrum antibiotics by avoiding unintended effects on commensal bacteria .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	the sequence - specificity and short length of antisense antimicrobials also pose little risk to human gene expression .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	because antisense antimicrobials are a platform technology , they can be rapidly designed and synthesized to target almost any microbe .

a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) and influenza virus are common causes of infantile lower respiratory tract infection ( lrti ) .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	it is widely believed that both viral replication and inappropriately enhanced immune responses contribute to disease severity .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	in infants , rsv lrti is known to be more severe than influenza virus lrti .

a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	we analyzed lung tissue from infants with fatal cases of rsv and influenza virus lrti to determine the types of inflammatory cells present .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	quantities of lymphocyte - derived cytokines were minimal in secretions from infants with rsv infection .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	concentrations of most cytokines were greater in influenza virus , rather than rsv , infection .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	lung tissues from infants with fatal rsv and influenza virus lrti demonstrated an extensive presence of viral antigen and a near absence of cd8-positive lymphocytes and natural killer cells , with marked expression of markers of apoptosis .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	severe infantile rsv and influenza virus lrti is characterized by inadequate ( rather than excessive ) adaptive immune responses , robust viral replication , and apoptotic crisis .

4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	the antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate ( cq ) and hydroxychloroquine ( hcq ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ace2 without significant change of cell - surface ace2 and , therefore , might be potent inhibitors of sars - cov-2 infections .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	pulmonary diseases due to mycobacteria cause significant morbidity and mortality to human health .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	in addition to tuberculosis ( tb ) , caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) , recent epidemiological studies have shown the emergence of non - tuberculous mycobacteria ( ntm ) species in causing lung diseases in humans .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	although more than 170 ntm species are present in various environmental niches , only a handful , primarily mycobacterium avium complex and m. abscessus , have been implicated in pulmonary disease .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	while tb is transmitted through inhalation of aerosol droplets containing mtb , generated by patients with symptomatic disease , ntm disease is mostly disseminated through aerosols originated from the environment .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	however , following inhalation , both mtb and ntm are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in the lungs .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	although the pathophysiology of tb and ntm diseases share several fundamental cellular and molecular events , the host - susceptibility to mtb and ntm infections are different .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	striking differences also exist in the disease presentation between tb and ntm cases .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	while ntm disease is primarily associated with bronchiectasis , this condition is rarely a predisposing factor for tb .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	similarly , in human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv)-infected individuals , ntm disease presents as disseminated , extrapulmonary form rather than as a miliary , pulmonary disease , which is seen in mtb infection .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	the diagnostic modalities for tb , including molecular diagnosis and drug - susceptibility testing ( dst ) , are more advanced and possess a higher rate of sensitivity and specificity , compared to the tools available for ntm infections .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	however , the treatment of drug - resistant tb requires the additional , newer class of antibiotics in combination with or without the first and second - line drugs .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	in contrast , the ntm species display significant heterogeneity in their susceptibility to standard anti - tb drugs .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	thus , the treatment for ntm diseases usually involves the use of macrolides and injectable aminoglycosides .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	although well - established international guidelines are available , treatment of ntm disease is mostly empirical and not entirely ( continued on next page )

5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	in the age of a pandemic , such as the ongoing one caused by sars - cov-2 , the world faces limited supply of tests , ppe and reagents , and factories are struggling to meet the growing demands .
5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pooling specimen for testing of sars - cov-2 virus , to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing .
5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting sars - cov-2 , and the pcr cycle threshold ( ct ) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t - test .
5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	this study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates , ranging from 0.1 - 10 % .
5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	pooling specimens to test for covid-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80 % .

8e7e144a3c19ba3e020eae3a23b5d18a78bf1441	finally , we propose and simulate a strategy of controlled natural immunization through risk based population compartmentalization ( pc ) wherein the population is divided in low risk ( lr ) and high risk ( hr ) compartments based on risk factors ( like comorbidities and age ) and subjected to different disease transmission dynamics by isolating the hr compartment while allowing the lr compartment to develop natural immunity .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections , hundreds of thousands of deaths and major societal disruption due to lockdowns and other restrictions introduced to limit disease spread .

56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	recent successes in malaria control and elimination have reduced the global malaria burden , but these gains are fragile and progress has stalled in the past 5 years .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	withdrawing successful interventions often results in rapid malaria resurgence , primarily threatening vulnerable young children and pregnant women .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	malaria programmes are being affected in many ways by covid-19 .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	for prevention of malaria , insecticide - treated nets need regular renewal , but distribution campaigns have been delayed or cancelled .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	for detection and treatment of malaria , individuals may stop attending health facilities , out of fear of exposure to covid-19 , or because they can not afford transport , and health care workers require additional resources to protect themselves from covid-19 .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	supplies of diagnostics and drugs are being interrupted , which is compounded by production of substandard and falsified medicines and diagnostics .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	these disruptions are predicted to double the number of young african children dying of malaria in the coming year and may impact efforts to control the spread of drug resistance .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	using examples from successful malaria control and elimination campaigns , we propose strategies to re - establish malaria control activities and maintain elimination efforts in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , which is likely to be a long - term challenge .

3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	these scales are typically based on a variety of theoretical and diagnostic frameworks .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	given current conceptual ambiguities , building on previous studies , we evaluated the dimensional structure of 50 scales targeting the assessment of supposedly problematic behaviours in relation to four technologies : internet , smartphones , video games , and social network sites .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	we find that two dimensions ( ' compulsive use ' and ' negative outcomes ' ) account for over 50 % of all scale - items analysed .

3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	the findings indicate , firstly , that a majority of scales place an inordinate emphasis on some dimensions over others and , secondly , that despite differences in the items presented , at a dimensional level , there exists a high degree of similarity between scales .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	these findings highlight shortcomings in existing scales and underscore the need to develop more sophisticated conceptions and empirical tools to understand possible problematic interactions with various digital technologies .

ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	notably , rna virus genomes 28 are sensed by mammalian cytosolic rig - i - like receptors , thereby activating 29 interferon - stimulated gene ( isg ) expression to restrict viral replication .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	however , 30 recent evidence indicates that the cgas - sting dna sensing pathway also 31 protects against rna viruses .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	so far , the mechanisms responsible for dna sensing 32 of rna viruses , which replicate without known dna intermediates , remain unclear .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	by using cgas gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell 34 , we discovered that dna sensing and cgamp
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	synthase activities are 35 required for cgas - mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and sindbis 36 virus .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	the level of cgamp produced in response to rna virus infection was below 37 the threshold of detection , suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of 38 cgamp are produced during rna virus infections .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	to clarify the dna ligands that 39 activate cgas activity , we confirmed that cgas binds mitochondrial dna in the 40 cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells ; however , the amount of 41 cgas - associated mitochondrial dna did not change in response to virus infection .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	importantly , 44 cgas knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cgas drives 45 low - level isg expression at steady state .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	we propose that cgas - sting restricts 46 rna viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells , likely 47 primed by endogenous cellular dna ligands .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	many medically important rna viruses are restricted by the cgas - sting 50 dna - sensing pathway of innate immune activation .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	since these viruses replicate 51 without dna intermediates , it is unclear
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	we show here that cgas 's dna binding and signaling 53 activities are required for rna virus restriction , similar to the mechanisms by which it 54 restricts dna viruses .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	furthermore , we confirmed that cgas continuously binds host 55 dna , which was unaffected by rna virus infection .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	we propose that cgas - mediated sensing of 58 endogenous dna ligands contributes to rna virus restriction by establishing a 59 baseline of innate immune activation .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	61 a key feature of innate immunity is the detection of pathogen - associated 62 molecular patterns ( pamps ) by pattern recognition receptors ( prrs )
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	for 63 mammalian cells , viral nucleic acids are detected by distinct prrs , triggering 64 interferon - stimulated gene ( isg ) expression to set up an antiviral state .

ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	retinoic acid - inducible gene
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	however , the recent discovery of the cgas - sting cytosolic dna sensing 68 pathway , and the observation that it can also restrict rna viruses ( 2 ) , reveals a need 69 to further investigate the mechanisms of nucleic acid sensing during rna virus 70 infection .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	the stimulator of interferon genes ( sting ) is an endoplasmic reticulum - and 72 mitochondrial - bound protein that spontaneously activates isg expression when 73 overexpressed ( 2 ) .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	although sting is involved in dna sensing , sting -/mice and 74 mouse endothelial fibroblasts ( mefs ) are more permissive for vesicular stomatitis 75 virus ( vsv ) , a negative - stand rna virus ( 2 , 3 ) .

db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	experiments were performed on intact and denuded ( with mucosa removed ) bladder strips .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	the maximum effect of efs was not significantly different between cie and control bladders .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	nerve - evoked efs contractions ( tetrodotoxin - sensitive ) were blocked by a combination of atropine ( cholinergic antagonist ) and a , b - methylene atp ( an atp analog that desensitizes purinergic receptors ) .

db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	our data demonstrate a deficit in the nerve - evoked cholinergic component of contraction that is not due to the ability of the smooth muscle to respond to acetylcholine .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	we conclude that neurodegenerative bladder dysfunction in this model of multiple sclerosis may be due , in part , to pathologic changes in the mucosa that causes suppression of muscarinic receptor - mediated contractile response and augmentation of purinergic response of the underlying muscle .
