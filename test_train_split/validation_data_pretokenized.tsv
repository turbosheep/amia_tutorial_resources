f4917ba5561d79fe1548de0ea71ecd959b35c31a	using a large dataset of genome - wide rna - seq profiles derived from human dermal fibroblasts ( gse113957 ) we investigated whether age affects the expression of pattern recognition receptor ( prr ) genes and ace2 , the receptor for sars - cov-2 .
f4917ba5561d79fe1548de0ea71ecd959b35c31a	older age was associated with increased expression of prr genes , ace2 and four genes that encode proteins that have been shown to interact with sar2-cov-2 proteins .
f4917ba5561d79fe1548de0ea71ecd959b35c31a	assessment of prr expression might provide a strategy for stratifying the risk of severe covid-19 disease at both the individual and population levels .
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	recombination and reassortment of viral genomes are major processes contributing to the creation of new , emerging viruses .
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	these processes are especially significant in long - term persistent infections where multiple viral genotypes co - replicate in a single host , generating abundant genotypic variants ,
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	some of which may possess novel host - colonizing and pathogenicity traits .
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	in some plants , successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues and introduction of new genotypes of a virus by vector transmission allows for viral populations to increase in complexity for hundreds of years allowing co - replication and subsequent recombination of the multiple viral genotypes .
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	using a resequencing microarray , we examined a persistent infection by a citrus tristeza virus ( ctv ) complex in citrus , a vegetatively propagated , globally important fruit crop , and found that the complex comprised three major and a number of minor genotypes .
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	subsequent deep sequencing analysis of the viral population confirmed the presence of the three major ctv genotypes and , in addition , revealed that the minor genotypes consisted of an extraordinarily large number of genetic variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes .
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	further analysis provided evidence that some of the recombinants underwent subsequent divergence , further increasing the genotypic complexity .
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	these data demonstrate that persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes within a host organism is sufficient to drive the large - scale production of viral genetic variants that may evolve into new and emerging viruses .

9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	international endodontic journal .
9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic , healthcare professionals are at the forefront of managing the highly infectious coronavirus .
9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	as the most common route of transmission is via aerosols and droplet inhalation , it is critical for healthcare workers to have the correct personal protective equipment ( ppe ) including gowns , masks and goggles .
9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	surgical masks are not effective in preventing the influenza and sars , so they are unlikely to be able to resist contaminated aerosols from entering the respiratory system .
9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	therefore , it is vital to use respirators which have been proven to offer better protection against droplets , aerosols and fluid penetration and which form a tight seal around the mouth and nose .
9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	various types of respirators are used in healthcare settings , such as half - mask filtering facepiece respirators ( ffrs ) and powered air - purifying respirators ( paprs ) .
9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	the most commonly used ffr is the n95 disposable respirator , which is tight fitting and has a 95 % or above particle filtering efficiency for a median particle size of 0.3 µm .
9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	this review discusses respirators , their purpose , types , clinical efficiency and proper donning and doffing techniques .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	newcastle disease virus ( ndv ) causes a highly contagious and economically important disease in poultry .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	viral determinants of ndv virulence are not completely understood .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	the amino acid sequence at the protease cleavage site of the fusion
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	( f ) protein has been postulated as a major determinant of ndv virulence .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	in this study , we have examined the role of f protein cleavage site sequence in ndv virulence using reverse genetics technology .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	the sequence g - r - q - g - r present at the cleavage site of the f protein of avirulent strain
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	lasota was mutated to r - r - q - k - r , which is present in the f cleavage site of neurovirulent strain beaudette c ( bc ) .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	the resultant mutated
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	lasota v.f. virus did not require exogenous protease for infectivity in cell culture , indicating that the f protein was cleaved by intracellular proteases .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	the virulence of the mutant and parental viruses was evaluated in vivo by intracerebral pathogenicity index ( icpi ) and intravenous pathogenicity index ( ivpi ) tests in chickens .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	our results showed that the modification of the f protein cleavage site resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence from an icpi value of 0.00 for lasota to a value of 1.12 for lasota v.f.
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	however , the icpi value of lasota v.f. was lower than that of bc , which had a value of 1.58 .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	interestingly , the ivpi tests showed values of 0.00 for both lasota and lasota v.f. viruses , compared to the ivpi value of 1.45 of bc .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	in vitro characteristics of the viruses were also studied .
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	our results demonstrate that the efficiency of cleavage of the f protein plays an important role if the ndv is delivered directly into the brains of chicks , but there could be other viral factors that probably affect peripheral replication , viremia , or entry into the central nervous system .

ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	a total of 52 volunteers were recruited to take part in a dual - centered , randomized , blinded study so investigators could determine whether the level of airborne infection could be significantly reduced in patients randomly assigned to treatment with either nasaleze ®
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	cellulose extract alone or a combination of nasaleze cellulose and powdered garlic extract ( pge ) .
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	one puff into each nostril was recommended , and volunteers who developed an infection while traveling were told to use at least 3 puffs per nostril until symptoms were reduced .
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	this study took place over an 8-wk period across finland and the united kingdom between november 2006 and march 2007 .
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	volunteers were instructed to use a 5-point scale to assess their health and to record infectious episodes and symptoms in a daily diary .
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	the activetreatment group ( nasaleze cellulose with pge ) experienced significantly fewer infections than the control group ( 20 vs 57 ; p<.001 ) and far fewer days on which an infection was obviously present ( 126 d in the active group vs 240 d in the control group ; p<.05 ) .
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	consequently , volunteers in the active group were less likely to pick up an airborne infection when pge was added to this novel cellulose extract .
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	volunteers in the control group were much more likely to report more than 1 infectious episode over the treatment period or to endure longer periods of infection .
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	the investigators concluded that the combination nasaleze travel formulation significantly reduced the number of airborne infections to which volunteers were exposed while traveling .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	for an emerging disease like covid-19 , systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	with repeated sampling , immune monitoring creates a real - time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	however , single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1 % of the population .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	here , the machine learning workflow tracking responders expanding ( t - rex ) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	t - rex identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and sars - cov-2 infections .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	mhc tetramers were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead ' left out ' to serve as a test of whether t - rex identifies biologically significant cells .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	in the rhinovirus challenge study , t - rex identified virus - specific cd4 + t cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by ≥95 % following infection .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	t - rex successfully identified hotspots with virus - specific t cells using pairs of samples comparing day 7 of infection to samples taken either after clearing the infection ( day 28 ) or samples taken prior to infection ( day 0 ) .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	this revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some covid-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	other covid-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy .
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	t - rex analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context .
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	after the first reported case of zika virus ( zikv ) in brazil , in 2015 , a significant increase in the reported cases of microcephaly was observed .
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	microcephaly is a neurological condition in which the infant 's head is significantly smaller with complications in brain development .
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	recently , two small membrane - associated interferon - inducible transmembrane proteins ( ifitm1 and ifitm3 ) have been shown to repress members of the flaviviridae family which includes zikv .
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	however , the exact mechanisms leading to the inhibition of the virus are yet unknown .
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	here , we assembled an interactome of ifitm1
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	and ifitm3 with known protein - protein interactions ( ppis ) collected from publicly available databases and novel ppis
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	predicted using the high - confidence protein - protein interaction prediction ( hippip ) model .
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	we analyzed the functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins , and found that there are several immunity pathways ( toll - like receptor signaling ,
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	cd28 signaling in t - helper cells , crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells ) , neuronal pathways

e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	that are associated with these interactors .
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	our novel ppis associate cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells to microcephaly , and may also shed light on potential targets of zikv for host invasion by immunosuppression and cytoskeletal rearrangements .
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	these results could help direct future research in elucidating the mechanisms underlying host defense to zikv and other flaviviruses .

2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	objective video - based depictions of electroconvulsive therapy ( ect ) can be useful for educational purposes , but many of the readily available resources may worsen already stigmatized views of the procedure .
2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	educators ' common reliance on such material highlights the paucity of equipoised depictions of modern ect well suited for the training of health professionals .
2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	the authors developed and tested a new educational module enhanced by videotaped depictions of a simulated patient undergoing the consent , treatment , recovery , and follow - up phases of ect .
2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	methods
2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	the didactic intervention interspersed 7 short video clips ( totaling 14 min ) into a 55-min lecture on treatment - resistant depression .
2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	the session , part of an intensive course of preclinical psychiatry , was delivered online through synchronous videoconferencing with zoom .
2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	the primary outcome measure was change in the questionnaire on attitudes and knowledge of ect ( quake ) .
2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	results fifty - three out of 63 ( 87 % )
2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	eligible second - year medical students completed assessments at baseline and after exposure to the didactic intervention .

6cd877aceddfcb8f5160d1dd3f49794779613d5b	health , as defined by the who , is a multidimensional concept that includes different aspects .
6cd877aceddfcb8f5160d1dd3f49794779613d5b	interest in the health conditions of the oldest - old has increased as a consequence of the phenomenon of population aging .
6cd877aceddfcb8f5160d1dd3f49794779613d5b	this study investigates whether ( 1 ) it is possible to identify health profiles among the oldest - old , taking into account physical , emotional and psychological information about health , and ( 2 ) there are demographic and socioeconomic differences among the health profiles .
6cd877aceddfcb8f5160d1dd3f49794779613d5b	methods :
6cd877aceddfcb8f5160d1dd3f49794779613d5b	latent class analysis with covariates was applied to the mugello study data to identify health profiles among the 504 nonagenarians residing in the mugello district ( tuscany , italy ) and to evaluate the association between socioeconomic characteristics and the health profiles resulting from the analysis .

6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	affected calves exhibit tympany , hemorrhagic abomasitis , and abomasal ulceration .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	gram - positive bacilli are often found on affected mucosa and in submucosa .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	aspects of etiology beyond the infecting organism are little understood , but probably include dietary issues , perhaps relating to overfeeding , feeding of barely thawed or contaminated colostrum , or conditions which effect decreased gut motility .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in a cloned gaur calf is illustrative of the syndrome .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	the calf developed pasty yellow and bloody diarrhea , and the abdomen became distended and painful .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	in spite of intensive therapy , the calf died 48 h after birth .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	at necropsy , the distended abomasum contained clotted milk and bloody fluid , and the abomasal and omasal walls were thickened and hemorrhagic .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	the proximal duodenum was hemorrhagic and emphysematous , and microscopic examination revealed gram - positive rods in association with acute , necrotizing , hemorrhagic mucosal inflammation .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	isolates of c. perfringens from this calf were pcr positive for cpb2 , the gene encoding beta2 toxin .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	this finding is of unknown significance ; only 14.3 % ( 8/56 ) of isolates from other calves with the syndrome have been cpb2 positive , and only 50 % of cpb2 positive bovine isolates express cpb2 .
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	the most prominent needs to further our understanding of this problem are consistent experimental reproduction of the disease , elucidation of virulence attributes , and development and application of prevention and control strategies .

538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	infectious diseases of livestock have negative consequences for animal production as well as animal health and welfare and can be transmitted between farms via direct ( live animal movements ) as well as indirect ( via physical vectors such as , people , transport vehicles and fomites ) contacts .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	the objective of the study was to examine the travel patterns of professionals visiting swedish farms ( veterinarians , milk tanker drivers , artificial inseminators , maintenance technicians and livestock hauliers ) .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	this was done by obtaining records of the farms visited by a sample of professionals in the above categories in one week in january , one week in april , one week in july and one week in october in the swedish counties västerbotten , södermanland , västergötland and skåne .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	results :
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	there were twelve participating organisations , and data was provided for one to three individuals / vehicles/ veterinary practices per professional category and per geographic region ( except for dairy service technicians and livestock hauliers who did not provide data from all regions ) .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	there was a trend towards larger areas covered and smaller number of farms visited per week in the north , but exceptions occurred and there were regional variations .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	generally , the greatest areas were travelled by milk tankers and livestock hauliers , and the profession travelling over the smallest areas tended to be the veterinarians .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	milk tankers visited most farms per week , one milk tanker could visit between 23 and 90 farms per week and travel over areas between 717 km 2 and 23,512 km 2 per week .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	conclusions :
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	valuable insight into the travel patterns of swedish professionals has emerged although the implications of the study largely concern highly infectious diseases .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	movement of live animals pose the greatest risk for the spread of infectious animal diseases ; however indirect contacts are important for many diseases .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	the results of this study indicate that in sweden a highly contagious disease might spread over a large area in the time span of one incubation period , which ought to be kept in mind in case of an outbreak and in outbreak investigations .
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	the difficulties in contacting some professionals visiting farms could be a problem in an outbreak situation .

7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	as healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients , and the risk of in - hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff , neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non - emergent procedures .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	under these unprecedented conditions , the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as covid-19 cases skyrocketed .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	methods data was collected by self - reporting surveys during two discrete periods : the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic , and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons ' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re - schedule the procedures .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	an acuity index was generated for each scenario , and this was used to rank the nine cases .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	results there were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	258 ( 52.5 % ) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	a total of 226 respondents ( 46.1 % ) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50 % .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	for the countries most affected by covid-19 , this proportion was 54.7 % .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	there was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast - evolving neuro - oncological cases are non - emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement , and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	conclusion
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	we report on the impact of covid-19 on neurosurgeons around the world .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	from their ranking of the nine case scenarios , we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non - emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic .
7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	with it , hopefully , neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus .

b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	the dromedary camel is considered a possible host of the virus and also to act as a reservoir , transmitting the virus to humans .
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	here , we studied evolutionary relationships for 31 complete genomes of betacoronaviruses , including eight newly sequenced mers - cov genomes isolated from dromedary camels in saudi arabia .
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	through bioinformatics tools , we also used available sequences and 3d structure of mers - cov spike glycoprotein to predict mers - cov epitopes and assess antibody binding affinity .
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	phylogenetic analysis showed the eight new sequences have close relationships with existing strains detected in camels and humans in arabian gulf countries .
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	the 2019-ncov strain appears to have higher homology to both bat coronavirus and sars - cov than to mers - cov strains .
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	the spike protein tree exhibited clustering of mers - cov sequences similar to the complete genome tree , except for one sequence from qatar ( kf961222 ) .
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	b cell epitope analysis determined that the mers - cov spike protein has 24 total discontinuous regions from which just six epitopes were selected with score values of > 80 % .
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	our results suggest that the virus circulates by way of camels crossing the borders of arabian gulf countries .
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	this study contributes to finding more effective vaccines in order to provide long - term protection against mers - cov and identifying neutralizing antibodies .

d72501b217d2f47435246abaa30b22aa1f504dc0	despite well - defined criteria for use of antibiotics in patients presenting with mild to moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( aecopd ) , their overuse is widespread .
d72501b217d2f47435246abaa30b22aa1f504dc0	we hypothesized that following implementation of a molecular multiplex respiratory viral panel ( rvp ) , aecopd patients with viral infections would be more easily identified , limiting antibiotic use in this population .
d72501b217d2f47435246abaa30b22aa1f504dc0	the primary objective of our study was to investigate if availability of the rvp decreased antibiotic prescription at discharge among patients with aecopd .

26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the covid-19 crisis , we ask : how can chief marketing officers ( cmos ) support marketing middle managers ( mmms ) in initiating radical change in crisis situations ?
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	we take the position that marketing managers ' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new - to - the - firm .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	we then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ' who does what ' in radical change initiatives from the marketing function , focusing on the underemphasized possibility of mmms initiating change and cmos implementing .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	building on recent findings on ' change role reversal ' , we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate , while top managers implement .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	this unconventional change route would see cmos taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis , while mmms take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	we identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal - approach faced by mmms throughout three stages of innovation - enabled radical change proposed by burgelman ( 1991 ; variation - selection - retention ) and chart corresponding roles that cmos can play to support mmms : advisor , judge , and guardian .
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	three tangible final questions addressed to cmos guide managerial applications , while considerations outside scope are also discussed .

643059679cd268bcfd1e5e8290f6659b2ac07a22	our present study proposes that the maldi - tof ms can be further used to screen functional and metabolic differences .
643059679cd268bcfd1e5e8290f6659b2ac07a22	while other studies applied the maldi - tof technique to identify subgroups within species , we investigated how various environmental factors could alter the unique bacterial signatures .
643059679cd268bcfd1e5e8290f6659b2ac07a22	we found that genetic and phenotypic differences between microorganisms belonging to the same species can be reflected in peptide - mass fingerprints generated by maldi - tof ms .
643059679cd268bcfd1e5e8290f6659b2ac07a22	these results suggest that maldi - tof ms can screen intra - species phenotypic differences of several microorganisms .

56ec24b06770347bc7dd532eb66c65f0cddc6f62	disaster risk reduction is an increasingly important policy issue , especially in developing countries that suffer most of the global human and economic losses associated with disasters .
56ec24b06770347bc7dd532eb66c65f0cddc6f62	indeed , public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses .
56ec24b06770347bc7dd532eb66c65f0cddc6f62	in saudi arabia , many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters , such as floods , disease epidemics , and sandstorms .

05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	although the covid-19 is known to cause by human - to - human transmission , it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	a retrospective study is conducted to study whether air quality index ( aqi ) , four ambient air pollutants ( pm 2.5 , pm 10 , no 2 and co ) and five meteorological variables ( daily temperature , highest temperature , lowest temperature , temperature difference and sunshine duration ) could increase covid-19 incidence in wuhan and xiaogan between jan 26 th to feb 29 th in 2020 .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	first , a significant correlation was found between covid-19 incidence and aqi in both wuhan ( r 2 = 0.13 , p<0.05 ) and xiaogan ( r 2 = 0.223 , p<0.01 ) .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	specifically , among four pollutants , covid-19 incidence was prominently correlated with pm 2.5 and no 2 in both cities .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	in wuhan , the tightest correlation was observed between no 2 and covid-19 incidence ( r 2 = 0.329 , p<0.01 ) .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	in xiaogan , in addition to the pm 2.5

05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	( r 2 = 0.015 , p<0.05 ) , a notable correlation was also observed between the pm 10 and covid-19 incidence ( r 2 = 0.105 , p<0.05 ) .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	moreover , temperature is the only meteorological parameter that constantly correlated well with covid-19 incidence in both wuhan and xiaogan , but in an inverse correlation ( p<0.05 ) .
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	aqi , pm 2.5 , no 2 , and temperature are four variables that could promote the sustained transmission of covid-19 .

f7ee7afaf51dae79d4b480b8b9aa926b03f638c0	overexpression of mir-193b in lung epithelial a549 cells also resulted in decreases of a / pr/8/34 infection .
f7ee7afaf51dae79d4b480b8b9aa926b03f638c0	furthermore , mir-193b inhibited the replication of various strains , including h1n1 ( a / pr/8/34 , a

f7ee7afaf51dae79d4b480b8b9aa926b03f638c0	further studies revealed that β - catenin was a target of mir-193b , and β - catenin rescued mir-193b - mediated suppression of iav infection .
f7ee7afaf51dae79d4b480b8b9aa926b03f638c0	mir-193b induced g0 / g1 cell cycle arrest and delayed vrnp nuclear import .
f7ee7afaf51dae79d4b480b8b9aa926b03f638c0	finally , adenovirus - mediated gene transfer of mir-193b to the lung reduced viral load in mice challenged by a sublethal dose of a / pr/8/34 .
f7ee7afaf51dae79d4b480b8b9aa926b03f638c0	collectively , our findings suggest that mir-193b represses iav infection by inhibiting wnt / β - catenin signalling .

7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	all inpatients who had stayed in the same ward as the initial index case patient for any duration before isolation were recruited into a cohort and followed up to document the occurrence of sars .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	the normalized concentration of virus - laden aerosols at different locations of the ward was estimated by use of computational fluid dynamics modeling .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	the attack rates in the various subgroups stratified by bed location were calculated .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	multivariate cox proportional hazards regression was used to document important risk factors .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	results .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	the overall attack rate of sars was 41 % ( 30 of 74 subjects ) .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	it was 65 % , 52 % , and 18 % in the same bay , adjacent bay , and distant bays , respectively ( ) .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	computation fluid dynamics modeling indicated that p p

7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	the normalized concentration of virus - laden aerosols was highest in the same bay and lowest in the distant bays .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	cox regression indicated that staying in the ward on 6 or 10 march entailed higher risk , as well as staying in the same or adjacent bays .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	the epidemic curve showed 2 peaks , and stratified analyses by bed location suggested 11 generation of spread .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	conclusions .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	the temporal - spatial spread of sars in the ward was consistent with airborne transmission , as modeled by use of computational fluid dynamics .
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	infected health care workers likely acted as secondary sources in the latter phase of the outbreak .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	background :
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	virus entry involves multiple steps and is a highly orchestrated process on which successful infection collectively depends .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via western blotting , polymerase chain reaction , and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	such studies have provided abundant direct evidence on how viruses interact with receptor molecules on the cell surface , induce cell signaling at the point of initial contact with the cell to facilitate internalization , and exploit existing endocytic mechanisms of the cell for their ultimate infectious agenda .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	however , there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	herein , we describe an optimized laboratory procedure to isolate individual organelles during different stages of endocytosis by performing subcellular fractionation .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	this methodology is established using kaposi 's sarcoma - associated herpesvirus ( kshv ) infection of human foreskin fibroblast ( hff ) cells as a model .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	with kshv and other herpesviruses alike , envelope glycoproteins have been widely reported to physically engage target cell surface receptors , such as integrins , in interactions leading to entry and subsequent infection .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	:
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	subcellular fractionation was used to isolate early and late endosomes ( ees and les ) by performing a series of centrifugations steps .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	specifically , a centrifugation step post - homogenization was utilized to obtain the postnuclear supernatant containing intact intracellular organelles in suspension .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	successive fractionation via sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed to isolate specific organelles including ees and les .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	intracellular kshv trafficking was directly traced in the isolated endosomal fractions .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	additionally , the subcellular fractionation approach demonstrates a key role for integrins in the endosomal trafficking of kshv .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	the results obtained from fractionation studies corroborated those obtained by traditional imaging studies .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	this study is the first of its kind to employ
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	a sucrose flotation gradient assay to map intracellular kshv trafficking in hff cells .
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	we are confident that such an approach will serve as a powerful tool to directly study intracellular trafficking of a virus , signaling events occurring on endosomal membranes , and dynamics of molecular events within endosomes that are crucial for uncoating and virus escape into the cytosol .
2bfa3061be84264c2b2bfb1a972894bd847b550f	the international classification of diseases ( icd ) relies on clinical features and lags behind the current understanding of the molecular specificity of disease pathobiology , necessitating approaches that incorporate growing biomedical data for classifying diseases to meet the needs of precision medicine .
2bfa3061be84264c2b2bfb1a972894bd847b550f	our analysis revealed that the heterogeneous molecular diversity of disease chapters and the blurred boundary between disease categories in icd should be further investigated .
2bfa3061be84264c2b2bfb1a972894bd847b550f	here , we propose a new classification of diseases ( ncd ) by developing an algorithm that predicts the additional categories of a disease by integrating multiple networks consisting of disease phenotypes and their molecular profiles .
2bfa3061be84264c2b2bfb1a972894bd847b550f	with statistical validations from phenotype - genotype associations and interactome networks , we demonstrate that ncd improves disease specificity owing to its overlapping categories and polyhierarchical structure .
2bfa3061be84264c2b2bfb1a972894bd847b550f	furthermore , ncd captures the molecular diversity of diseases and defines clearer boundaries in terms of both phenotypic similarity and molecular associations , establishing a rational strategy to reform disease taxonomy .
f42e5b1a8e7e77b998cb233f689c4107e19c7c1d	emerging infectious diseases ( eids ) have always been one of the major threats to public health .
f42e5b1a8e7e77b998cb233f689c4107e19c7c1d	although the implementation of mandatory testing for 4 classical transfusion - transmitted infectious - human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis b virus , hepatitis c virus , and syphilis - has reduced the transfusion risk of these pathogens , the potential threat of various eid agents and their constantly evolving variants to blood safety in china is not fully understood .
f42e5b1a8e7e77b998cb233f689c4107e19c7c1d	this review presents 9 representative eid agents that are autochthonous and epidemic nationally or regionally in china .
f42e5b1a8e7e77b998cb233f689c4107e19c7c1d	the epidemiologic status and distribution of these eid agents among donors and/or healthy populations are summarized .
f42e5b1a8e7e77b998cb233f689c4107e19c7c1d	the potential risks of these eid agents to blood safety are discussed .
f42e5b1a8e7e77b998cb233f689c4107e19c7c1d	the review also explores strategies to strengthen hemovigilance systems and studies to further evaluate the impact of eid agents on blood safety .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	disasters , particularly earthquakes , volcanoes , floods , war - related complications , famine and infectious epidemics , have been a part of recorded human experience .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	from pompeii to the johnston flood and world war ii and the black plague to the spanish influenza , there have been catastrophic occurrences that will not long be forgotten by either legend or history books .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	nevertheless , those occurrences were relatively few and far - between before the mid - twentieth century .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	indeed , the nature of disasters has changed since then .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	from terrorists taking advantage of`new technology ' to weather - related events that cause trillions of dollars worth of damages and economic loss , the world has evolved .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	in the last 50 to 60 years alone , the risk and frequency of events with multiple injuries and deaths has increased dramatically [ 1±4 ] and it is bound to increase logarithmically over the next half century .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	not only is the earth more heavily - populated with human beings settling across many more regions of the planet , but there are also larger concentrations of human inhabitants dependent on other resources for sustenance .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	dependency on others for complicated food supply chains , refrigeration , fuel and power sources and public health hygiene ( sewage handling ) , makes human populations more vulnerable than ever before and less self - sufficient .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	in addition , these large , vulnerable population centers are often concentrated in high - risk locales such as metropolitan cities where very frequent and multiple person - to - person contacts occur .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	often they are along disaster prone areas , be they in coastline or sub - sea level reclaimed lands .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	in addition , the world now faces a broadened spectrum of disasters , ranging from terrorist bombings , unconventional wars , nuclear releases , transportational mishaps , worldwide infectious disease epidemics and chemical discharges ( technology - generated ) to floods , famine , earthquakes , tornadoes , cyclones , fires , and other natural disasters ' [ 2 , 4 ] .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	it may also be that human technology has increased the likelihood of more severe and more frequent natural disasters .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	whether it is global warming ( from industry and omnipresent internal combustion machines ) leading to stronger and more frequent hurricanes or the jumbo jet that rapidly translocates deadly influenza viruses around the planet , the threat continues to evolve far beyond the world of our grandparents .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	therefore , although famine , war , plagues , earthquakes and such threats have darkened the human experience , the on - going spiral of human populations , the rapid growth of technology , relatively easy world - wide travel for millions and the exponential expansion of at - risk industries and domiciles have now conspired to dramatically increase human exposure to catastrophic events .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	in turn , the potential for casualties resulting from each incident is more likely to be much larger [ 2 ] and the magnitude of the economic costs beyond our current comprehension .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	the recent undersea earthquake in the indian ocean that sent towering , 700 kilometer per hour tsunamis across southern asia resulted in a tremendous number of deaths and morbidity because of the sheer volume of exposures in vulnerable sites .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	the 1950s seaside fishing villages of 5,000 local inhabitants had become cosmopolitan , internationally - populated , destination resorts hosting hundreds of thousands supported by multi - national industries and technology .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	such expanding population bases living and working in vulnerable situations along the at - risk seashores such as phuket , thailand , or in major metropolitan settlements built below sea level such as new orleans , usa , provided unprecedented fodder for disaster , regardless of continent .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	likewise , the recent earthquake in pakistan that killed tens of thousands in a few minutes might not have had such an effect 50 years ago when such concentrated populations centers did not exist .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	if that were not enough , beyond a higher risk for casualties and frequency of events , the events have now become global with far - reaching psychological and sociological impact .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	while still true in some respects , the old adage that ªall disasters are localº may have become somewhat anachronistic since the mid-20 th century .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	although the christmas 2004 tsunami disaster occurred in southern asia , it affected many other countries worldwide because those nation 's citizens and many international businesses were involved .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	mass air travel , economic strategic initiatives and evolving technology have all changed the face
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	of`local ' disasters .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	with the rapid growth of air travel and relatively affluent worldwide economies , travel and sightseeing have morphed from an occasional pastime of the very privileged and the eclectic adventurer into a prevailing norm of worldwide mass tourism .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	likewise , industries have also become global , often seeking heavily - populated sites where labor may be more economical and local workforces readily available to work for lower wages .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	a large number of the victims of the indian ocean tsunamis were foreign nationals operating businesses and many , many tourists , including celebrities , were caught up in this asian calamity as well .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	thus , in many ways , disasters throughout the world have now become multinational in nature , having global impact , an impact amplified by mass media coverage and internet streaming of the events .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	even so , a disaster in new orleans involving mainly geography of only a few tens of kilometers , had ramifications in major cities hundreds of miles of way .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	both before , and especially after , the strike of hurricane katrina in late august of 2005 , many tens of thousands of evacuees had to settle in dallas and houston affecting resources in those cities and taxing the local medical system .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	for example , one dallas shelter ( 750 kilometers from new orleans ) treated twice the number of medical problems and emergencies ( among the evacuees ) than it would on a day - to - day basis in the city 's main trauma center .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	this sudden surge in medical problems required the establishment of a`field ' medical facility for more than two weeks after the storm had dissolved .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	not only did those patients have their day - to - day medical , dental and psychological needs , but they were now at greater risk in terms of compromised immune systems ( nutrition / sleep deprived and psychologically - stressed ) , but also because of crowded conditions .
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	from another perspective , despite the relatively fewer number of deaths than the
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	adverse drug reaction ( adr ) is a significant public health concern world - wide .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	numerous graph - based methods have been applied to biomedical graphs for predicting adrs in pre - marketing phases .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	adr detection in post - market surveillance is no less important than premarketing assessment , and adr detection with large - scale clinical data have attracted much attention in recent years .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	however , there are not many studies considering graph structures from clinical data for detecting an adr signal , which is a pair of a prescription and a diagnosis that might be a potential adr .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	in this study , we develop a novel graphbased framework for adr signal detection using healthcare claims data .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	we construct a drug - disease graph with nodes representing the medical codes .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	the edges are given as the relationships between two codes , computed using the data .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	we apply graph neural network to predict adr signals , using labels from the side effect resource database .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	the model shows improved auroc and auprc performance of 0.795 and 0.775 , compared to other algorithms , showing that it successfully learns node representations expressive of those relationships .
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	furthermore , our model predicts adr pairs that do not exist in the established adr database , showing its capability to supplement the adr database .

a0f29aaebf701ab133a66886ccb35bffe6033662	( sars - cov-2 ) has emphasized the urgency to develop effective therapeutics .
a0f29aaebf701ab133a66886ccb35bffe6033662	drug repurposing screening is regarded as one of the most practical and rapid approaches for the discovery of such therapeutics .

5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	in 2009 , pandemic h1n1 influenza virus ( 2009 h1n1 ) emerged worldwide , causing morbidity and mortality that disproportionately affected young adults .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	upper respiratory infection ( uri ) , largely due to adenovirus , is an endemic cause of morbidity in military training .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	whether clinical presentations differ or excess morbidity results from coinfection is unclear .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	demographic , clinical , and pcr data from throat and nasal specimens for adenovirus and 2009 h1n1 were prospectively collected .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	results : 375 trainees with uri enrolled and were tested for both adenovirus and 2009 h1n1 by pcr ( median age 20 ; 89 % male ) .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	adenovirus pcr was positive in 72 % ( 96 % serotype e-4 ) and 2009 h1n1 in 20 % .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	males were more likely to have adenovirus and females more likely to have 2009 h1n1 ( p = 0.047 ) .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	subjects with 2009 h1n1 presented an average of 1 week earlier in training , had shorter illness duration before enrollment , less sore throat , diarrhea , and fewer abnormal findings on throat exam .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	coryza and cough were more common with 2009 h1n1 compared to adenovirus .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	subjects with 2009 h1n1 were less likely to have adenovirus than those without , despite persistently high frequencies of adenovirus detections during peak 2009 h1n1 weeks ( 15 % vs. 83 % , p , 0.01 ) .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 h1n1 was rare ( 4 % ) .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	rates of hospitalization and pneumonia did not differ between the adenovirus , 2009 h1n1 , or coinfected groups .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	conclusion :
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	military trainees with 2009 h1n1 vs. adenovirus have differing clinical presentations , and males are more likely to have adenovirus .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	despite high frequencies of adenovirus infection , coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 h1n1 is rare and apparently does not result in increased morbidity .

54440a66bfd06044fbfdf583650fbc4cebf21241	therefore , various antiviral strategies to counter nidoviral infections are under evaluation .
54440a66bfd06044fbfdf583650fbc4cebf21241	lectins , which bind to n - linked oligosaccharide elements of enveloped viruses , can be considered as a conceptionally new class of virus inhibitors .
54440a66bfd06044fbfdf583650fbc4cebf21241	these agents were recently evaluated for their antiviral activity towards a variety of enveloped viruses and were shown in most cases to inhibit virus infection at low concentrations .

b67eaef6982a45225485a226931164873fb18b33	the dynamics emerging from infodemics have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns .
b67eaef6982a45225485a226931164873fb18b33	for the field of business and economics , understanding these dynamics is of ultimate importance : it supports , for example , anticipating individual behavior , which might help reduce the uncertainty entailed by the covid-19 pandemic and allows for assessing the efficiency of policy decisions to contain its effects .
b67eaef6982a45225485a226931164873fb18b33	in addition to is central , whereby the way information spreads in a society is strongly affected by the employed algorithms for information provision and by personalization .
b67eaef6982a45225485a226931164873fb18b33	from the perspective of linguistics , specific language signals in communication which emerge during pandemics have to be taken into account ( e.g. , emotion - related words , avoiding causal terms ) .
b67eaef6982a45225485a226931164873fb18b33	considering linguistic patterns in the context of infodemics appears to be highly relevant as they strongly affect how information is interpreted , factchecked , made sense of by non - expert persons , and the way misinformation is automatically detected .
b67eaef6982a45225485a226931164873fb18b33	from a cognitive psychology point of view , the focus is on how motives , intuition and affect influence the search and evaluation of information , and on how cognitive processes , the digital information environment and linguistic patterns together shape individuals ' understanding of critical events , risk perception and behavior .

b67eaef6982a45225485a226931164873fb18b33	we make the perspectives of these scientific disciplines explicit and propose a way to integrate them .
b67eaef6982a45225485a226931164873fb18b33	the contribution of further disciplines is strongly needed , which is why we conclude with a call to action which should encourage researchers to collaborate across scientific disciplines and unfold collective creativity which will push forward research on infodemics substantially .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	recently a novel coronavirus ( sars - cov-2 ) emerged from wuhan , china and has infected more than 571000 people leading to more than 26000 deaths .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	since sars - cov-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of sars , we sought to analyze all the available sars - cov-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from sars genome specifically focusing on non - coding rnas .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	here , results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded mirnas that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded mirnas that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded mirnas that could target the genome of both the viruses ( sars - cov-2 and sars reference genome ) .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host mirnas that could target sars - cov-2 genome as compared to the sars reference genome .

1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	our analysis further identified a similar " ga " rich motif in sars - cov-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe sars infections .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	hence , we successfully identified human and virus encoded mirnas that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host mirnas could target sars - cov-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals .
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	we identified non - coding sequences in sars - cov-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards sars pathology .

b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	the inhibitors show robust cytotoxic effects in multiple cancer cell lines and induce cell - cycle arrest and apoptosis .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	we further demonstrate that concurrent disruption of the acetyllysine binding function of brd4 and the kinase activities of pi3 k and cdk4/6
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	by the tp inhibitor improves efficacy in several cancer models .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	together , these findings provide further compelling evidence that these multi - action inhibitors are efficacious and more potent than single inhibitory chemotypes .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	the bromodomain and extra - terminal domain ( bet ) proteins have emerged as promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of a wide array of human diseases , particularly inflammation and cancer 1 - 5 .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	of the four members of the bet family proteins , brd4 is the most thoroughly characterized , and its aberrant activity has been associated with nut midline carcinoma , colon , breast and prostate cancers , neuroblastoma , and hematopoietic cancers .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	brd4 overexpression has been shown to promote tumor growth by stimulating transcription of major oncogenic drivers , such as myc .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	most recently brd4 has been identified as the human protein to which the protein e from the sars - cov-2 virus binds 6 .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	brd4 contains two bromodomains , brd4 bd1 and brd4 bd2 , that recognize acetylated lysine residues in histones and non - histone proteins .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	specifically , brd4 bd1 binds to acetylated histones , including poly - acetylated histone h4 , recruiting and/or stabilizing brd4-containing transcription complexes at target gene promoters and enhancers 7 , whereas the second bromodomain , brd4 bd2 , is also capable of associating with acetylated non - histone proteins 8 .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	a wide array of inhibitors of brd4 as well as pan - bet inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials , yet there is a pressing need to improve the efficacy of inhibition .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	bet inhibitors are known to produce variable anti - proliferative effects , and cancer cells often develop resistance to the drugs through activating compensating survival signaling pathways that bypass the drug action 9 - 12 .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	these limitations can be overcome through concurrent targeting multiple signaling pathways that support cancer growth and characterized by synthetic lethality relationship .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	this could be achieved through applying a combination of synergistic individual inhibitors or using a single molecule capable of binding to multiple targets .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	a combined therapy through inhibiting brd4 and pi3 k by a single molecule has been shown to produce potent antitumor effects in several cancer models driven by myc [ 13 ]
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	[ 14 ] [ 15 ] .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	in addition to reducing tumor growth , inhibition of both brd4 and pi3 k reduces the infiltration of myeloid - derived suppressor cells and stimulates antitumor immune responses 16 .
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	dual and triple activity inhibitors specific for bet and other known oncogenic drivers , including cyclin - dependent kinases ( cdk ) , mapk , plk1 , hdac , cbp / p300 , and alk are being developed 17 - 21 .

50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	as one of the most important mosquito - borne viral diseases , dengue infection is now becoming a global concern due to its rapid spread and rise in incidence .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	currently , there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral drug for dengue virus ( denv ) infection .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	glycyrrhetinic acid ( gna ) and its related derivatives have been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	however , it is unknown whether carbenoxolone disodium ( cbx ) , one of the gna derivatives , affects denv infection .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	here , we found that the production of infectious denv particles was significantly decreased by cbx treatment in denv - permissive cells , while the viral rna and viral protein synthesis were not affected .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	moreover , results from time - of - addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of cbx on denv was exhibited by targeting the virus itself , not the host cells .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	directly incubating denv with cbx resulted in a remarkable reduction of virus titer and virus infectivity .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	furthermore , denv rna from progeny virions in the supernatants was significantly decreased by cbx treatment in a dose - dependent manner .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	taken together , these data indicate that the antiviral activity of cbx against denv may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself .
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	our work , for the first time , demonstrates that cbx has antiviral activity against denv infection , providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against dengue .

d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	the incidence of cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) pneumonia is increasing in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies .
d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	the utility of cmv - dna viral load measurement has not been standardized , and viral cut - off values have not been established .
d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	this study was designed to investigate the utility of cmv quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) using bronchial washing fluid .
d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	methods :
d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	we retrospectively reviewed the microbiologic and pathologic results of bronchial washing fluid and biopsy specimens in addition to the patients ' clinical characteristics .
d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	results :
d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	a total of 565 cmv qrt - pcr assays were performed using bronchial washing fluid from patients with hematologic malignancies .

d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	the median cmv load determined by qpcr was 1.8 × 10

d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	( 3.6 10 3 -1.5 × 10 8 ) in cmv pneumonia patients and 3.0 × 10

fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556	to understand viral disease , detection and identification of these viruses are essential .
fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556	although pcr is widely used for rapid virus identification due to its low cost and high sensitivity and specificity , very few online database resources have compiled pcr primers for rna viruses .
fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556	to effectively detect viruses , the mrprimerv database ( http://mrprimerv.com ) contains 152 380 247 pcr primer pairs for detection of 1818 viruses , covering 7144 coding sequences ( cdss ) , representing 100 % of the rna viruses in the most up - to - date ncbi refseq database .
fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556	due to rigorous similarity testing against all human and viral sequences , every primer in mrprimerv is highly target - specific .
fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556	because mr - primerv ranks cdss by the penalty scores of their best primer , users need only use the first primer pair for a single - phase pcr or the first two primer pairs for two - phase pcr .
fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556	moreover , mrprimerv provides the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using each primer pair , covering 22 192 variants of 532 refseq rna viruses .
fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556	we believe that the public availability of mrprimerv will facilitate viral metagenomics studies aimed at evaluating the variability of viruses , as well as other scientific tasks .

d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	the s1 subunit of the spike is assumed to be required for virus attachment .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	however , we have previously shown that this domain of the embryo - and cell culture adapted beaudette strain , in contrast to that of the virulent m41 strain , is not sufficient for binding to chicken trachea
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	( wickramasinghe et al . , 2011 ) .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	in the present study , we demonstrated that the lack of binding of beaudette s1 was not due to absence of virus receptors on this tissue nor due to the production of s1 from mammalian cells , as s1 proteins expressed from chicken cells also lacked the ability to bind ibvsusceptible embryonic tissue .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	subsequently , we addressed the contribution of the s2 subunit of the spike in ibv attachment .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	recombinant ibv beaudette spike ectodomains , comprising the entire s1 domain and the s2 ectodomain , were expressed and analyzed for binding to susceptible embryonic chorio - allantoic membrane ( cam ) in our previously developed spike histochemistry assay .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	we observed that extension of the s1 domain with the s2 subunit of the beaudette spike was sufficient to gain binding to cam .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	a previously suggested heparin sulfate binding site in beaudette s2 was not required for the observed binding to cam , while sialic acids on the host tissues were essential for the attachment .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	to further elucidate the role of s2 the spike ectodomains of virulent ibv m41 and chimeras of m41 and beaudette were analyzed for their binding to cam , chicken trachea and mammalian cell lines .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	while the m41 spike ectodomain showed increased attachment to both cam and chicken trachea , no binding to mammalian cells was observed .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	in contrast , beaudette spike ectodomain had relatively weak ability to bind to chicken trachea , but displayed marked extended host range to mammalian cells .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	binding patterns of chimeric spike ectodomains to these tissues and cells indicate that s2 subunits most likely do not contain an additional independent receptor - binding site .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	rather , the interplay between s1 and s2 subunits of spikes from the same viral origin might finally determine the avidity and specificity of virus attachment and thus viral host range .

d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	the coronaviral s protein is a highly glycosylated class i viral fusion protein ( bosch et al . , 2003 ) , which in some coronaviruses , including ibv , is cleaved during synthesis into an s1 and an s2 subunit by the host serine protease furin ( de haan et al . , 2004 ; ) .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	the s1 is essential for initial attachment of the virus , while the membrane anchored s2 subunit or domain , containing the remaining part of the ectodomain , a transmembrane domain and an endodomain , drives virus - cell fusion ( reviewed in heald - sargent and gallagher , 2012 ) .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	all coronaviral receptor - binding domains ( rbd ) currently identified are located within the s1 subunit or domain ( reviewed in belouzard et al . , 2012 ; graham and baric , 2010 ) .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	for ibv , the exact location of the rbd has , however , not yet been elucidated .
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	heterogeneity between ibv strains is mainly associated with differences in s1 , but ibv spike 0168 - 1702/$

e09e904ff206052537e487864dfb605e2f3d3fe7	despite this , china has opened the door for ngo participation in its aids response , initially because of donor pressure but increasingly due to official acknowledgment of the important role these groups play in controlling the epidemic .
e09e904ff206052537e487864dfb605e2f3d3fe7	since the first aids ngos were established in china in the 1990s , chinese aids ngos have made unique contributions to china 's aids response in critical areas like access to drugs , support for treatment compliance , outreach to marginalized at - risk groups , and efforts to reduce stigma among marginalized populations .

5cded487793694de49b640b3972285bfc8431cfb	these diseases have become more prominent in the wake of policies to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal production .
5cded487793694de49b640b3972285bfc8431cfb	this has led to more research focused on better understanding the immune system and its responses to pathogen challenge , and thus developing informed strategies to exploit immune responses that can support enhanced disease resistance and growth performance .

1016fc58593492ea195614b6e3ed8d1be960973a	methods :
1016fc58593492ea195614b6e3ed8d1be960973a	forty - seven cases of covid-19 and 45 cases of other viral pneumonias ( control ) were included in this study .
1016fc58593492ea195614b6e3ed8d1be960973a	the laboratory parameters were compared between covid-19 and control patients as well as severe and moderate covid-19 patients from the clinical recovery stage to the 4 weeks postdischarge recovery stage .

6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	background :
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	we are currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge , managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as covid-19 .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	while china - where the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic , different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	nonetheless , authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures , even if not everything is known .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	methods :
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	to facilitate this task , we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	our work referred initially to the situation in spain as of february 28 , 2020 , where a few dozens of cases had been detected , but has been updated to match the current situation as of 13 april .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	we implemented an seir metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data - driven stochastic simulations .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	results :
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the world health organization , namely , that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms , followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease , which , although might not be sufficient for disease eradication , would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	conclusions :
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown , such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	however , preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	the scenarios evaluated here through data - driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals ' flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation .
6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	therefore , resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the new cases and isolate them .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	an epidemic curve is a graphic depiction of the number of outbreak cases by date of illness onset , ordinarily constructed after the disease outbreak is over .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	however , a good estimate of the epidemic curve early in an outbreak would be invaluable to health care officials .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	on the other hand , from the end of february , the sars - cov-2 epidemic in brazil seems to not following the europe , or in particular , italy or spain .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	even if less tests have been applied , there are less deaths occurring in brazil than in both cited countries .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	however , due to the few applied tests , there is no certain planning on the real number of active cases .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	to estimate the number of future cases , epidemiologists make an educated guess as to how many people might become affected .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	we have proposed a simple fitting model using a simulated annealing technique , testing it with the south korea data .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	we have tested and discussed the uncertainties of the model .
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	we also have analyzed the trends in the confirmed cases using this model for the five most affected countries plus brazil along several epidemic weeks .

b9881ca556b8d6e74c2fe3b9c2195429fcb0d09d	viral evolution was observed in sequentially collected samples .
b9881ca556b8d6e74c2fe3b9c2195429fcb0d09d	conclusions :
b9881ca556b8d6e74c2fe3b9c2195429fcb0d09d	prolonged influenza a h1n1pdm shedding was observed in cancer patients .

e0bb2e0110f5172294d8f36218061e110e6aeff7	however , rabies associated to the rural cycle remains endemic , with a significant , though oscillating - annual incidence of rabies in cattle .
e0bb2e0110f5172294d8f36218061e110e6aeff7	despite the plethora of studies on genetic analyses of brazilian rabv , isolates from southern brazil have only scarcely been investigated .
e0bb2e0110f5172294d8f36218061e110e6aeff7	this work was performed to identify the genetic lineages of rabvs circulating in states of rs and sc .
e0bb2e0110f5172294d8f36218061e110e6aeff7	fifty - nine rabv cattle isolates from rs and sc were selected and submitted to reverse transcription / polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr )

88836be43482650dfdb4fc0cc47ca6e2d6afd759	since these muscles are innervated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems , respectively , different parameters of the plr can be used as indicators for either sympathetic or parasympathetic modulation .
88836be43482650dfdb4fc0cc47ca6e2d6afd759	thus , the plr provides an important metric of autonomic nervous system function that has been exploited for a wide range of clinical applications .

5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	recently , it has been reported that the n - terminal domain ( ntd ) of s1 domain of pedv spike protein is responsible for binding to the 5-n - acetylneuraminic acid ( neu5ac ) , a possible sugar co - receptor .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	therefore , the ntd of s1 domain could be an attractive target for the development of subunit vaccines .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	in this study , the ntd spanning amino acid residues 25 - 229
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	( s25 - 229 ) of s1 domain of pedv variant strain was expressed in escherichia coli
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	bl21 ( de3 ) in the form of inclusion bodies ( ibs ) .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	s25 - 229 ibs were solubilized in 20 mm sodium acetate ( ph 4.5 ) buffer containing 8 m urea and 1 mm
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	dithiothreitol with 95 % yield .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	solubilized s25 - 229 ibs were refolded by 10-fold flash dilution and purified by one - step cation exchange chromatography with > 95 % purity and 20 % yield .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	the cd spectrum of s25 - 229 showed the characteristic pattern of alpha helical structure .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	in an indirect elisa , purified s25 - 229 showed strong reactivity with mouse anti - pedv sera .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	in addition , immunization of mice with 20 mg of purified s25 - 229 elicited highly potent serum igg titers .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	finally , mouse antisera against s25 - 229 showed immune reactivity with native pedv s protein in an immunofluorescence assay .
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	these results suggest that purified s25 - 229 may have potential to be used as a subunit vaccine against pedv variant strains .

2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	we previously showed that erythropoietin ( epo ) attenuates the morphological signs of spinal cord ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) injury in swine [ 1 ] without , however , improving neurological function .
2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	the clinical use of epo has been cautioned most recently due to serious safety concerns arising from an increased mortality in acute stroke patients treated with epo and simultaneously receiving systemic thrombolysis [ 2 ] .
2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	carbamylated epo ( cepo ) is an epo derivative without erythropoietic activity and devoid of the epo side eff ects , but with apparently well maintained cytoprotective qualities [ 3 ] .
2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	we therefore tested the hypothesis whether cepo may be equally effi cient as epo in reducing morphological as well as functional aortic occlusion - induced spinal cord

2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	results while endogenous glucose production was not aff ected by hypothermia , it was signifi cantly higher in the septic animals when compared with the corresponding sham operated groups , most likely due to the ongoing noradrenaline infusion .
2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	in contrast , despite the catecholamine infusion and higher glucose release , whole body glucose oxidation was signifi cantly reduced in normothermic septic animals .
2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	during hypothermia , h 2 s shifted substrate towards preferential glucose utilisation , but this eff ect disappeared in the septic mice .
2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	conclusions h 2 s inhalation alone does not infl uence glucose metabolism once temperature is maintained at normothermic levels in anesthetised and mechanically ventilated mice .
2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	the h 2 s - related shift of energy metabo lism towards preferential carbohydrate oxidation present during hypothermia is blunted during sepsis , possibly as a result of the ongoing catecholamine treatment .

327182e27ac733136b2880cd0084140971270d69	we find that the quantity of information about covid-19 is indeed overwhelming , but that the majority of links shared can not be rated for its credibility .
327182e27ac733136b2880cd0084140971270d69	reasons for this failure to rate include widespread use of social media and news aggregators .
327182e27ac733136b2880cd0084140971270d69	the majority of links that could be rated came from credible sources ; however , we found a large increase in the proportion of state - sponsored propaganda among non - credible and less credible urls , suggesting that covid-19 may be used as a vector to spread misinformation and disinformation for political purposes .
327182e27ac733136b2880cd0084140971270d69	overall , results indicate that covid-19 is unfolding in a highly uncertain information environment that not may amenable to fact - checking as scientific understanding of the disease , and appropriate public health measures , evolve .

fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	in this study , we elucidated the anti - inflammatory effect of ypfs that is mediated through modulating the expression of three key enzymes involved in ibd : inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( cox-2 ) , and intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( ialp ) .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	in a lipopolysaccharide ( lps)-induced chronic - inflammation model of cultured murine macrophages , ypfs treatment suppressed the activation of inos and cox-2 expression in a dose - dependent manner .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	conversely , application of ypfs in cultured small intestinal enterocytes markedly induced the expression of ialp in a time - dependent manner , which might strengthen the intestinal detoxification system .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	a duality of ypfs in modulating the expression of inos and cox-2 was determined here .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	the expression of inos and cox-2 in macrophages was induced by ypfs , and this activation was partially blocked by the nf - kb - specific inhibitor bay 11 - 7082 , indicating a role of nf - kb signaling .
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	these ypfs - induced changes in gene regulation strongly suggest that the anti - inflammatory effects of ypfs are mediated through the regulation of inflammatory enzymes .

2986796bb44bcd30d7de07831d6532f691a466b1	the world is currently changing due to coronavirus disease 2019 , and the field of dentistry is no stranger to this .
2986796bb44bcd30d7de07831d6532f691a466b1	the care of patients in the dental office involves very strict biosafety protocols , and patients must be aware of the protection barriers implemented to allow satisfactory , safe dental care .

cc860539c12079ee4ef13795d275472ced3344f9	driven by increasing demands of assisting users to dress and match clothing properly , fashion recommendation has attracted wide attention .
cc860539c12079ee4ef13795d275472ced3344f9	its core idea is to model the compatibility among fashion items by jointly projecting embedding into a unified space .
cc860539c12079ee4ef13795d275472ced3344f9	however , modeling the item compatibility in such a category - agnostic manner could barely preserve intra - class variance , thus resulting in sub - optimal performance .
cc860539c12079ee4ef13795d275472ced3344f9	in this paper , we propose a novel category - aware metric learning framework , which not only learns the cross - category compatibility notions but also preserves the intra - category diversity among items .
cc860539c12079ee4ef13795d275472ced3344f9	specifically , we define a category complementary relation representing a pair of category labels , e.g. , tops - bottoms .
cc860539c12079ee4ef13795d275472ced3344f9	given a pair of item embeddings , we first project them to their corresponding relation space , then model the mutual relation of a pair of categories as a relation transition vector to capture compatibility amongst fashion items .
cc860539c12079ee4ef13795d275472ced3344f9	we further derive a negative sampling strategy with non - trivial instances to enable the generation of expressive and discriminative item representations .

8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	upon target dna recognition , we create a specific enhancer for detection of pcr-57

8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	sena is highly sensitive , with its limit of detection being at least 2 59 copies / reaction lower than that of the corresponding rrt - pcr , and highly specific ,
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	which 60 identifies both false - negative and false - positive cases in clinic applications .
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	sena provides 61 effective confirmation for nucleic acid amplification - based molecular diagnosis , and may 62 immediately eliminate the uncertainty problems of rrt - pcr in sars - cov-2 clinic detection .
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	since december 2019 , the outbreak of covid-19 , caused by the infection of the sars - cov-68 2 , has rapidly spread throughout the world ( 1 ) , and is now a global pandemic .
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	till june 1 , 2020 , 69 the outbreak has affected 216 countries , areas and territories , infected 6 million people , and caused 70 more than 370 thousand of death ( 2 ) .
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	one of the greatest public health concerns in combating 71 against the pandemic is a prompt response to meet the urgent demand for rapid and accurate 72 diagnosis of the virus .
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	currently , nucleic acid amplification - based molecular diagnostics ( mdx ) 73 is
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	the most accurate , fast and affordable and thus the preferred method for diagnosis of sars- cov-2 infection , and the real - time reverse transcription pcr ( rrt - pcr ) kits have been 75 successfully developed by quite a few laboratories and commercial companies ( 3 ) .
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	however , since 76 its clinical application at least five months ago in china , the diagnostic performance of rrt - pcr 77 for sars - cov-2 has brought some urgent challenges , particularly with the frequently encountered 78 high ct - value designated " grey zone " associated uncertain negative or positive readouts ( 4 - 8 ) .

8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	besides of " human error " factors such as misconducted sampling , unqualified reagents and 80 uncalibrated diagnostic equipment , inefficient rt reaction and pcr amplification of clinical 81 samples with very low viral loads are likely the major intrinsic causative factors for the fuzzy rrt-82 pcr readouts and uncertain diagnosis .
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	although repetitive sampling and assays are implemented 83 for final confirmation of the diagnosis , these " trouble shooting " efforts are time - consuming and 84 may still fail to detect the low viral load samples from some mild or asymptomatic patients , or 85 from the recovering patients , resulting in false - negative diagnosis that may cause serious public 86 concerns in battling against the pandemic ( figure 1 ) .

8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	the underline mechanism for crispr-91 dx , as illustrated by the cas12a - based holmes system for example ( 18 ) , is based on the efficient 92 trans - cleavage activity against a fluorophore quencher ( fq)-labeled single - stranded dna reporter 93 by cas12a triggered upon target dna recognition , which is guided by a specific crispr rna 94 ( crrna ) , generating exponentially increasing fluorescence signal within several minutes .
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	with 95 this mechanism , here , we design a specific enhancer for detection of pcr - amplified nucleic 96 acids ( sena ) to improve both the detection sensitivity and specificity against

8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	if a kit detects more than one gene , e.g. , orf1ab 108 ( " abbreviated as o " ) , e and n genes , corresponding crrnas were mixed in a sena system to 109 enhance the detection signal .

0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	therefore , lowering the cspg levels by an digestive enzyme was suggested as a way of promoting intratumoral transport of larger therapeutic compounds , making this ecm a potential target for adjuvant therapy
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	[ 36 , 37 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	for example , tumor growth and invasion was reduced when these ecm molecules were digested by blocking antibodies against versican [ 36 ] or manipulating rna against phosphacan [ 38 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	cspg degradation by classical proteases such as mmp-1 and mmp-8 also results in an increase in diffusion and hydraulic conductivity in solid tumors [ 39 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	in oncolytic virus therapy , the diffusion - limiting properties of cspgs are blamed for low therapeutic anti - tumor efficacy due to the inefficient intratumoral spread of oncolytic viruses within the compact glioma [ 40 , 41 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	the cspg receptor lar was shown to be involved in promoting or inhibiting tumor invasion [ 33 , 42 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	in recent work [ 42 ] , cspgs were suggested to be a biochemical indicator of non - invasive tumor and diffusely infiltrating tumor .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	in the study , they found that ( i ) a cspg - rich microenvironment was associated with a strong cell - ecm adhesion and stimulated resident astrocytes to actively escape the cspg - dense lesions , leading to the self - contained non - invasive tumor surrounded by astrocytes .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	( ii )
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	glycosylated cspgs were not found in invasive gbm [ 42 ] and no collective migration of astrocytes was observed .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	( iii )
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	these cspg conditions also changed the profile of ramified and activated microglia within and outside the tumor .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	( iv ) cspg - induced cell - ecm bonding was mediated by its receptor lar and lar - csgag complex [ 42 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	integrins usually mediate the cell - matrix interactions by tethering the cell to its surrounding ecm and activating intracellular signalling cascades [ 43 , 44 ] .

0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	i ( chase - abc ) is an enzyme that can eliminate chondroitin sulfate glycosoamino glycans from proteoglycans without harmful effects in vivo [ 40 ] and has been widely tested for its effect on neuronal regeneration after cns injury .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	this bacterial enzyme is known for its ' loosening ' effect on the ecm scaffold [ 24 , 45 ] and studied for enhancement of regeneration of injured axonal tracts .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	chase - abc was also suggested as an attractive target to enhance oncolytic virus ( ov ) spread in in vivo [ 40 ] and in silico [ 41 ] experiments and its anti - tumor effect has been proposed in phase i / ii trials for patients treated in asia [ 46 ] .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	a glioma interacts with its microenvironment such as stromal cells ( astrocytes , neurons , microglia , macrophages ) , ecm , vessels , and chemokines

0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	m1 and m2 types of microglia were shown to promote glioma cell invasion by exchanging signaling molecules such as csf-1 , .
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	astrocytes also play a significant role in the progression , aggression , and angiogenesis of cns tumors [ 53 , 54 ] .

1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b	yet , the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown .
1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b	here , we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence .
1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b	our genome - level analyses show that the spike protein , which is responsible for receptor binding , has undergone significant darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-ncov and sars
1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b	- cov. further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain ( rbd ) of the spike protein between covid-19 and sars - related cov clades , leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their rbd protein sequences .
1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b	in addition to the spike protein , we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein , orf3a , suggesting their possible co - evolutionary convergence .
1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b	our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between covid-19 and sars - related cov , possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors .
1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b	finally , it should be noted that many observed bat sars - like covs that have an evolutionary convergent rbd sequence with 2019-ncov and sars - cov may be preadapted to human host receptor ace2 , and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future .

2def22f387794a0a8bc75678132663f4d253d39c	however , many researchers on in - network caching have focused on where to cache rather than how to cache : the former is known as contents deployment in the network and the latter is known as cache replacement in an icn element .
2def22f387794a0a8bc75678132663f4d253d39c	although , the cache replacement has been intensively researched in the context of web - caching and content delivery network previously , the conventional approaches can not be directly applied to icn due to the fine granularity of cacheable items in icn , which eventually changes the access patterns .
2def22f387794a0a8bc75678132663f4d253d39c	in this paper , we argue that icn requires a novel cache replacement algorithm to fulfill the requirements in the design of high performance icn element .
2def22f387794a0a8bc75678132663f4d253d39c	then , we propose a novel cache replacement algorithm to satisfy the requirements named compact clock with adaptive replacement ( compact car ) , which can reduce the consumption of cache memory to one - tenth compared to conventional approaches .

698174035746c185ce55489b4a345026d82dcc42	since antigen presenting cells play a major role in the initiation of the immune response , the in vitro transcriptional response of bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( bmdcs ) and monocytes in the context of prrsv and s. suis co - infection was investigated .
698174035746c185ce55489b4a345026d82dcc42	bmdcs were found to be more permissive than monocytes to prrsv infection ; s. suis phagocytosis by prrsv - infected bmdcs was found to be impaired , whereas no effect was found on bacterial intracellular survival .

6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	with increased globalisation comes the likelihood that infectious disease appearing in one country will spread rapidly to another , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) being a recent example .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	however , although sars infected some 10,000 individuals , killing around 1000 , it did not lead to the devastating health impact that many feared , but a rather disproportionate economic impact .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	the disproportionate scale and nature of this impact has caused concern that outbreaks of more serious disease could cause catastrophic impacts on the global economy .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	understanding factors that led to the impact of sars might help to deal with the possible impact and management of such other infectious disease outbreaks .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	in this respect , the role of risk - its perception , communication and management - is critical .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	this paper looks at the role that risk , and especially the perception of risk , its communication and management , played in driving the economic impact of sars .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	it considers the public and public health response to sars , the role of the media and official organisations , and proposes policy and research priorities for establishing a system to better deal with the next global infectious disease outbreak .
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	it is concluded that the potential for the rapid spread of infectious disease is not necessarily a greater threat than it has always been , but the effect that an outbreak can have on the economy is , which requires further research and policy development .

633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	ebolaviruses induce lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers ( vhfs ) in humans and non - human primates , with the exceptions of reston virus ( restv ) , which is not pathogenic for humans .
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	in human vhf cases , extensive analyses of the humoral immune responses in survivors and non - survivors have shown that the igg responses to nucleoprotein ( np ) and other viral proteins are associated with asymptomatic and survival outcomes , and that the neutralizing antibody responses targeting ebolaviruses glycoprotein ( gp 1,2 ) are the major indicator of protective immunity .
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	on the other hand , the immune responses in non - human primates , especially naturally infected ones , have not yet been elucidated in detail , and the significance of the antibody responses against np and gp 1,2 in restv - infected cynomolgus macaques is still unclear .
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	in this study , we analyzed the humoral immune responses of cynomolgus macaque by using serum specimens obtained from the restv epizootic in 1996 in the philippines to expand our knowledge on the immune responses in naturally restv - infected non - human primates .
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	results :
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	the antibody responses were analyzed using igg - elisa , an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay ( ifa ) , and a pseudotyped vsv - based neutralizing ( nt ) assay .
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	antigen - capture ( ag)-elisa was also performed to detect viral antigens in the serum specimens .
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	we found that the anti - gp 1,2 responses , but not the anti - np responses , closely were correlated with the neutralization responses , as well as the clearance of viremia in the sera of the restv - infected cynomolgus macaques .
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	additionally , by analyzing the cytokine / chemokine concentrations of these serum specimens , we found high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines / chemokines , such as ifnγ , il8 , il-12 , and mip1α , in the convalescent phase sera .
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	conclusions :
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	these results imply that both the antibody response to gp 1,2 and the proinflammatory innate responses play significant roles in the recovery from restv infection in cynomolgus macaques .

27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	the aim of this project was to determine how different melanoma cell lines m14 and sk - mel-28 behave , grow and expand in 3d in vitro models using collagen - based scaffolds .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	collagen scaffolds contained either chondroitin to mimic skin tissue , hyaluronic acid or nano - hydroxyapatite to mimic bone tissue .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	all tested scaffolds were populated with melanoma m14 and sk - mel-28 cells that were left to grow for 28 days .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	scaffold infiltrations by cells were assessed on day 1 , 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	populated scaffolds were then processed with a tissue processor , embedded in paraffin wax , sliced up with a microtome and stained with h&e followed by bright field microscopy .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	the images were put together in chronological order to see the growth progression .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	both sk - mel-28 and m14 cell lines have demonstrated most penetration when grown on chondroitin scaffolds , followed by hyaluronic acid scaffolds .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	cells grown on nano - hydroxyapatite scaffolds showed the least colonisation and tended to accumulate around the edges of the scaffold .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	m14 cells growing on chondroitin scaffolds demonstrated rapid infiltration when compared with sk - mel28 cells probably due to intrinsic aggressive growth properties .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	in conclusion , we have demonstrated for the first time the ability of collagen - based scaffolds to support melanoma cell growth and colonisation .
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	our findings can aid the development of a 3d in vitro scaffold - based platform to study melanoma biology .

4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	it is generally accepted that hemagglutinin ( ha)-mediated recognition of cell surface sialic acid ( sia ) is the first step in initiating iav infection , however surprisingly little is known regarding the identity of specific receptors and/or coreceptors that mediate virus internalization .
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	sia structures do not exhibit signalling capacity but may act as attachment factors , promoting interactions with specific transmembrane receptors for virus uptake .
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	alternatively , recognition of critical sia residues expressed by transmembrane receptors may be required to initiate virus entry .
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	as sia - independent entry and infection has also been reported 1,2 , it is possible that some receptors can bind iav and signal independently of sia , although attachment to sia may concentrate virions at the cell surface and augment this mode of entry .
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	the sorting of iav into particular entry pathways will be determined by specific adaptor protein(s )
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	that bind to the cytoplasmic tails of iav receptors and co - receptors , activating intracellular signalling proteins for subsequent internalization of virus .
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	while little is known regarding the specific entry receptors for iav expressed by epithelial cells , significant progress has been made towards identifying receptors that play a role in infectious entry of iav into macrophages ( mφ ) and dendritic cells ( dc ) .
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	c - type lectin receptors ( clrs ) are transmembrane glycoproteins that recognize glycans expressed on iav glycoproteins and
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	a number of distinct clrs have been implicated in promoting iav infection ( reviewed in 3 ) .
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	previous studies from our group implicated the macrophage mannose receptor ( mmr ) and the macrophage galactose - type lectin ( mgl)-1 in infectious entry of iav into mouse macrophages ( mφ ) 4 - 6 .

ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	the infection of a novel coronavirus found in wuhan of china ( 2019-ncov ) is rapidly spreading , and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide .
ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-ncov , various strategies are being tested in china , including drug repurposing .
ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	in this study , we used our pretrained deep learning - based drug - target interaction model called molecule transformer - drug target interaction ( mt - dti ) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-ncov.
ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	the result showed that atazanavir , an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , is the best chemical compound , showing a inhibitory potency with kd of 94.94 nm against the 2019-ncov 3c - like proteinase , followed by efavirenz ( 199.17 nm ) , ritonavir ( 204.05 nm ) , and dolutegravir ( 336.91 nm ) .
ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	interestingly , lopinavir , ritonavir , and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases .
ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	however , in our prediction , they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-ncov with an inhibitory potency with kd < 1000 nm.
ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	in addition , we also found that several antiviral agents , such as kaletra , could be used for the treatment of 2019-ncov , although there is no real - world evidence supporting the prediction .
ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	overall , we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the mt - dti model should be considered , when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-ncov.
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	heat shock proteins ( hsps ) are ubiquitous polypeptides expressed in all living organisms that participate in several basic cellular processes , including protein folding , from which their denomination as molecular chaperones originated .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	there are several hsps , including hspa5 , also known as 78-kda glucose - regulated protein ( grp78 ) or binding immunoglobulin protein ( bip ) that is an er resident involved in the folding of polypeptides during their translocation into this compartment prior to the transition to the golgi network .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	hspa5 is detected on the surface of cells or secreted into the extracellular environment .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	surface hspa5 has been proposed to have various roles , such as receptor - mediated signal transduction , a co - receptor for soluble ligands , as well as a participant in tumor survival , proliferation , and resistance .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	recently , surface hspa5 has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses , including the novel sars - cov-2 .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	in spite of these observations , the association of hspa5 within the plasma membrane is still unclear .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	to gain information about this process , we studied the interaction of hspa5 with liposomes made of different phospholipids .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	we found that hspa5 has a high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids , such as palmitoyl - oleoyl phosphoserine ( pops ) and cardiolipin ( cl ) .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	the n - terminal and c - terminal domains of hspa5 were independently capable of interacting with negatively charged phospholipids , but to a lesser extent than the full - length protein , suggesting that both domains are required for the maximum insertion into membranes .
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	interestingly , we found that the interaction of hspa5 with negatively charged liposomes promotes an oligomerization process via intermolecular disulfide bonds in which the n - terminus end of the protein plays a critical role .
f6d4bdeaa2cdb3373313bd4ff5b9cd942aa2424c	near infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometrics was investigated for the fast determination of total organic carbon ( toc ) and soluble solids contents ( ssc ) of tanreqing injection intermediates .
f6d4bdeaa2cdb3373313bd4ff5b9cd942aa2424c	the nir spectra were collected in transflective mode , and the toc and ssc reference values were determined with multi n / c uv hs analyzer and loss on drying method .
f6d4bdeaa2cdb3373313bd4ff5b9cd942aa2424c	the samples were divided into calibration sets and validation sets using the kennard - stone ( ks ) algorithm .
f6d4bdeaa2cdb3373313bd4ff5b9cd942aa2424c	the dixon test , leverage and studentized residual test were studied for the sample outlier analysis .
f6d4bdeaa2cdb3373313bd4ff5b9cd942aa2424c	the selection of wavebands , spectra pretreated method and the number of latent variables were optimized to obtain better results .
f6d4bdeaa2cdb3373313bd4ff5b9cd942aa2424c	the quantitative calibration models were established with 3 different pls regression algorithms , named linear pls , non - linear pls and concentration weighted pls , and the net result was defined as the average of the predicted values of the different calibration models .
f6d4bdeaa2cdb3373313bd4ff5b9cd942aa2424c	the overall results indicated that the presented method is more powerful than single multivariable regression method , characterized by higher mean recovery rate ( mrr ) of the validation set , and can be used for the rapid determination of toc and ssc values of tanreqing injection intermediates , which are two important quality indicators for the process monitoring .
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	control of the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) pandemic requires accurate laboratory testing to identify infected individuals , while also clearing essential staff to continue work .
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	at the current time a number of rt - pcr tests have been developed to identify sars - cov-2 , targeting multiple regions in the viral genome .
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	in comparison to other rna viruses the mutation rate of sars - cov-2 is moderate , however given the large number of transmission chains it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for mutations that might compromise these tests .
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	here we report the identification of a c - to - t transition at position 26340 of the sars - cov-2 genome which is associated with failure of the cobas ®

e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	this variant was detected in four health care workers from the same team .
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	whole genome sequencing of sars - cov-2 showed all four to carry genetically identical viruses .
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	examination of viral genomes deposited on gisaid showed this mutation has arisen independently on three occasions .
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	this work highlights the necessity of monitoring sars - cov-2 for the emergence of snps which might adversely affect the rt - pcrs used in diagnostics .
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	additionally , it argues that two regions in the sars - cov-2 should be targeted in rt - pcrs to avoid false negatives .

12797e9c799acbdfcc92ebba87dd6da38e07be65	although the threat of disease received extensive consideration and influenced research and management activities governing the endangered black - footed f m e t ( mustela nigripes ) in wyoming , a canine distemper epizootic in 1985 severely affected a captive breeding program and led to extirpation of the species from the wild .
12797e9c799acbdfcc92ebba87dd6da38e07be65	this recent example of the catastrophic effect of epizootic disease in an endangered species is described in an historical context
12797e9c799acbdfcc92ebba87dd6da38e07be65	in addition , examples are given of disease further endangering other rare species , including mauritius pink pigeon , pere david 's deer , cranes , maned wolves , native hawaiian birak , cheetahs , and others .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	there is a growing need for information regarding the recent coronavirus disease of 2019 .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	we present a comprehensive report of covid-19 patients in iran .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	one hundred hospitalized patients with covid-19 were studied .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	data on potential source of exposure , demographic , clinical , and paraclinical features , therapy outcome , and post - discharge follow - up were analyzed .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	the median age of the patients was 58 years , and the majority of the patients ( 72.7 % ) were above 50 years of age .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	fever was present in 45.2 % of the patients on admission .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	the most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath ( 74 % ) and cough ( 68 % ) .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	most patients had elevated c - reactive protein ( 92.3 % ) , elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( 82.9 % ) , lymphocytopenia ( 74.2 % ) on admission .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved , and ground - glass opacity ( 81.8 % )
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	was the most frequent finding in ct scans .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	the administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	lopinavir / ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	of the 70 discharged patients , 40 % had symptom relapse , ( 8.6 % ) were readmitted to the hospital , and 3 patients ( 4.3 % ) died .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	this report demonstrates a heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations in patients affected with covid-19 .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	the most common presenting symptoms are non - specific , so attention should be made on broader testing , especially in age groups with the greatest risk and younger individuals who can serve as carriers of the disease .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir / ritonavir ( in younger age group ) can be potential treatment options .
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	finally , patients discharged from the hospital should be followed up because of potential symptom relapse .
b474f9bee005c10021ee5bd7976b615812a18041	another aspect that should be considered is the difficulty to perform ct - scan in many hospitals due to the emergency that several countries are facing .
b474f9bee005c10021ee5bd7976b615812a18041	not all icu patients who deserve a chest ct scan for suspected pulmonary embolism are promptly diagnosed and indirect objective examinations , i.e. , echocardiography or lung ultrasonography do not help .
b474f9bee005c10021ee5bd7976b615812a18041	it may be that an unexpected worsening of the respiratory function together with a sudden increase of d - dimer levels are suggestive of pulmonary embolism , but this remains to be demonstrated .
b474f9bee005c10021ee5bd7976b615812a18041	to date , d - dimer levels help in predicting the severity of the disease and patient 's prognosis , as patients with high levels at admission die more than those with normal levels [ 7 ] .
b474f9bee005c10021ee5bd7976b615812a18041	with this panorama and all the uncertainties of care of icu patients with covid-19 , we believe journal pre - proof
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome contains a small envelope protein , e , with putative involvement in host apoptosis and virus morphogenesis .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	to perform these functions , it has been suggested that protein e can form a membrane destabilizing transmembrane ( tm ) hairpin , or homooligomerize to form a tm pore .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	indeed , in a recent study we reported that the a - helical putative transmembrane domain of e protein ( etm ) forms several sds - resistant tm interactions : a dimer , a trimer , and two pentameric forms .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	further , these interactions were found to be evolutionarily conserved .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	herein , we have studied multiple isotopically labeled etm peptides reconstituted in model lipid bilayers , using the orientational parameters derived from infrared dichroic data .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	we show that the topology of etm is consistent with a regular tm a - helix .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	further , the orientational parameters obtained unequivocally correspond to a homopentameric model , by comparison with previous predictions .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	we have independently confirmed that the full polypeptide of e protein can also aggregate as pentamers after expression in escherichia coli .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	this interaction must be stabilized , at least partially , at the tm domain .
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	the model we report for this pentameric a - helical bundle may explain some of the permabilizing properties of protein e , and should be the basis of mutagenesis efforts in future functional studies .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	background : eps r 7630 is a proprietary aqueous - ethanolic extract from roots of pelargonium sidoides dc and has been demonstrated to dispose among others of antibacterial , antiviral , immunomodulatory , antioxidant , and tissue - protective activity .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	it is an approved medicinal product in more than 50 countries for the treatment of airway infections such as acute bronchitis , common cold , and sinusitis .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	purpose :
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	while the pharmacological effects of eps r 7630 have extensively been evaluated in diverse in vitro test systems , the number of publications reporting results from in vivo models is limited .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	study design :
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	in the present study antitussive , secretolytic , and anti - inflammatory effects of eps r 7630 were assessed in animal experiments following oral administration at human equivalent doses .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	methods :
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	antitussive effects were evaluated using ammonia - and citric acid - induced models of cough in mice ( 20 , 40 , 120 mg / kg ) and guinea pigs ( 10 , 20 , 45 mg / kg ) , respectively .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	for the determination of secretolytic activity tracheobronchial secretion of intraperitoneally injected phenol red was determined in mice , while antiinflammatory action was assessed in an acute bacterial bronchitis model in rats .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	results : a significant and dose - dependent reduction of cough frequency was observed in both cough models , which was accompanied by a prolongation of cough latency time .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	similarly , the extract exerted a marked secretolytic activity in mice .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	induction of acute bacterial bronchitis caused characteristic histopathological changes in lung tissue adjacent to trachea and bronchi .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	the degree of these lesions was significantly reduced in rats treated with eps r 7630 at doses of 30 and 60 mg / kg .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	this protective effect at least partially seems to be mediated by an up - regulation of superoxide dismutase and a subsequent protective effect against oxidative stress as indicated by a reduced serum level of malondialdehyde .
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	conclusion :
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	the present data further support the therapeutic use of eps r 7630 in respiratory tract infections and provide a basis for detailed studies on its bioactive constituents as well as their in vivo mode of action .

227712d13de181665de71499a1bcd36ec708bae1	such a model for intervention that can be used elsewhere in the face of current global pandemic , or future disaster response .
cf3aabf42f361d630f238d5ed6be25fc235a3771	the recent pandemic triggered by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus boosted the demand for medical services and protective equipment , causing the generation rate of infectious medical waste ( imw ) to increase rapidly .
cf3aabf42f361d630f238d5ed6be25fc235a3771	designing an efficient and reliable imw reverse logistics network in this situation can help to control the spread of the virus .
cf3aabf42f361d630f238d5ed6be25fc235a3771	studies on this issue are limited , and minimization of costs and the risks associated with the operations of this network consisting of different types of medical waste generation centers ( mwgc ) are rarely considered .
cf3aabf42f361d630f238d5ed6be25fc235a3771	in this research , a linear programming model with three objective functions is developed to minimize the total costs , the risk associated with the transportation and treatment of imw , and the maximum amount of uncollected waste in mwgcs .
cf3aabf42f361d630f238d5ed6be25fc235a3771	also , multiple functions that calculate the amount of generated waste according to the parameters of the current epidemic outbreak are proposed .

436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	in this review , i use the term " perpetuation " for persistence of a virus in a population , since this is a different phenomenon from persistence of a virus in an infected host .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	important variables that influence perpetuation differ in small ( < 1,000 individuals ) and large ( > 10,000 ) populations
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	: in small populations , two important variables are persistence in individuals , and turnover of the population , while in large populations important variables are transmissibility , generation time , and seasonality .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	in small populations , viruses such as poliovirus that cause acute infections can not readily be perpetuated , in contrast to viruses such as hepatitis b virus , that cause persistent infections .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	however , small animal populations can turnover significantly each year , permitting the perpetuation of some viruses that cause acute infections .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	large populations of humans are necessary for the perpetuation of acute viruses ; for instance , measles required a population of 500,000 for perpetuation in the pre - measles vaccine era .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	furthermore , if an acute virus , such as poliovirus , exhibits marked seasonality in large populations , then it may disappear during the seasonal trough , even in the presence of a large number of susceptible persons .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	eradication is the converse of perpetuation and can be used as a definitive approach to the control of a viral disease , as in the instance of smallpox .
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	therefore , the requirements for perpetuation have significant implications for practical public health goals .

56a9bd299b9219f098f7b1f2cf1d95f7b65aa743	numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of viral gene delivery vectors , and recent clinical trials have shown promising results .
56a9bd299b9219f098f7b1f2cf1d95f7b65aa743	however , the tight control of transgene expression is likely to be required for therapeutic applications and in some instances , for safety reasons .
56a9bd299b9219f098f7b1f2cf1d95f7b65aa743	for this purpose , several ligand - dependent transcription regulatory systems have been developed .
56a9bd299b9219f098f7b1f2cf1d95f7b65aa743	among these , the tetracyclineregulatable system is by far the most frequently used and the most advanced towards gene therapy trials .
56a9bd299b9219f098f7b1f2cf1d95f7b65aa743	this review will focus on this system and will describe the most recent progress in the regulation of transgene expression in various organs , including the muscle , the retina and the brain .
56a9bd299b9219f098f7b1f2cf1d95f7b65aa743	since the development of an immune response to the transactivator was observed following gene transfer in the muscle of nonhuman primate , focus will be therefore , given on the immune response to transgene products of the tetracycline inducible promoter .
a2a873c09a0bc1b59d326245310e25a83031cd62	the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections has evolved substantially in recent years , with the emergence of new pathogens and the development of novel detection methods .
a2a873c09a0bc1b59d326245310e25a83031cd62	while recent advances have improved the sensitivity and turn - around time of diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses , they have also raised important issues such as cost , and the clinical significance of detecting multiple viruses in a single specimen by molecular methods .
a2a873c09a0bc1b59d326245310e25a83031cd62	this article reviews recent advances in specimen collection and detection methods for diagnosis of respiratory virus infections , and discusses the performance characteristics and limitations of these methods .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	since the covid-19 pandemic started , the public has been eager for news about promising treatments , and social media has played a large role in information dissemination .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	in this paper , our objectives are to characterize the public discussion of treatments on twitter , and demonstrate the utility of these discussions for public health surveillance .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	we pulled tweets related to three promising covid-19 treatments ( hydroxychloroquine , remdevisir and convalescent plasma ) , between the dates of february 28th and may 22nd using the twitter public api .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	we characterize treatment tweet trends over this time period .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	most major tweet / retweet / sentiment trends correlated to public announcement made by the white house and/or to new clinical trial evidence about treatments .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	most of the websites people shared in treatment - related tweets were nonscientific media sources that leaned conservative .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	hydroxychloroquine was the most discussed treatment on twitter , and over 10 % of hydroxychloroquine tweets mentioned an adverse drug reaction .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	there is a gap between the public attention / discussion around covid-19 treatments and their evidence .
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	twitter data can and should be used public health surveillance during this pandemic , as it is informative for monitoring adverse drug reactions , especially as many people avoid going to hospitals / doctors .
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	current study aims at prediction of the onset of malignant cardiac arrhythmia in patients with implantable cardioverter - defibrillators ( icds ) using machine learning algorithms .
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	the input data consisted of 184 signals of rr - intervals from 29 patients with icd , recorded both during normal heartbeat and arrhythmia .
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	for every signal we generated 47 descriptors with different signal analysis methods .
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	then , we performed feature selection using several methods and used selected feature for building predictive models with the help of random forest algorithm .
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	entire modelling procedure was performed within 5-fold cross - validation procedure that was repeated 10 times .
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	results were stable and repeatable .
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	the results obtained ( auc = 0.82 , mcc = 0.45 ) are statistically significant and show that rr intervals carry information about arrhythmia onset .
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	the sample size used in this study was too small to build useful medical predictive models , hence large data sets should be explored to construct models of sufficient quality to be of direct utility in medical practice .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	we present a massively parallel solver using the direction splitting technique and stabilized time - integration schemes for the solution of the three - dimensional non - stationary navier - stokes - boussinesq equations .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	the model can be used for modeling atmospheric phenomena .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	the time integration scheme utilized enables for efficient direction splitting algorithm with finite difference solver .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	we show how to incorporate the terrain geometry into the simulation and how to perform the domain decomposition .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	the computational cost is linear o(n ) over each sub - domain , and near to o(n / c ) in parallel over 1024 processors , where n is the number of unknowns and c
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	is the number of cores .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	this is even if we run the parallel simulator over complex terrain geometry .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	we analyze the parallel scalability experimentally up to 1024 processors over a prometheus linux cluster with multi - core processors .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	the weak scalability of the code shows that increasing the number of subdomains and processors from 4 to 1024 , where each processor processes the subdomain of 49 × 49 × 99 internal points ( 50 × 50 × 100 box ) , results in the increase of the total computational time from 120 s to 178 s for a single time step .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	thus , we can perform a single time step with over 1,128,000,000 unknowns within 3 min .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	the number of unknowns results from the fact that we have three components of the velocity vector field , one component of the pressure , and one component of the temperature scalar field over 256,000,000 mesh points .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	the computation of the one time step takes 3 min on a linux cluster .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	the direction splitting solver is not an iterative solver ; it solves the system accurately since it is equivalent to gaussian elimination .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	our code is interfaced with the mesh generator reading the nasa database and providing the earth terrain map .
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	the goal of the project is to provide a reliable tool for parallel , fully three - dimensional computations of the atmospheric phenomena .
b063814dfc5747f4e133d167fb638f9c6797525a	the covid-19 pandemic has put those who oversee medical education in a challenging position .
b063814dfc5747f4e133d167fb638f9c6797525a	medical school administrators , students , and national governing bodies have been forced to make difficult decision as a result of public health concerns and governmentenforced restrictions .
b063814dfc5747f4e133d167fb638f9c6797525a	we , as rising fourth - year medical students , would like to shed light upon the hard work that many of those in leadership positions have done as well as lay out some concerns that medical students who are preparing to apply to residency have .
b063814dfc5747f4e133d167fb638f9c6797525a	additionally , we would like to suggest several potential approaches that attempt to address some of the problems arising from the pandemic .
b063814dfc5747f4e133d167fb638f9c6797525a	continuing to balance education with the hurdles presented by covid-19 will require a multi - faceted and coordinated approach .
b063814dfc5747f4e133d167fb638f9c6797525a	we believe that implementing virtual rotations , delaying the opening of the application , decentralizing clinical skills evaluations , and modifying graduation requirements are possible options among many that could aid in addressing some of the current challenges presented by covid-19 .

80d5f3d9570784069b1a8b6994889272289ec2cc	sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) has been declared by who ( world health organisation ) as a global health threat .
80d5f3d9570784069b1a8b6994889272289ec2cc	within a period of four to five months in 2003 , the disease infected some 8,000 people in more than 25 countries and left 774 dead .
80d5f3d9570784069b1a8b6994889272289ec2cc	the many studies that have been done on the spread of sars in asia as well as countries as far flung as germany and canada have focused on the global dimension of the infectious disease as well as the speed of its spread upon emergence in southern china and then hong kong .
80d5f3d9570784069b1a8b6994889272289ec2cc	less attention has been paid to its spatial distribution at the national and local scales .
80d5f3d9570784069b1a8b6994889272289ec2cc	this discussion focuses on the spread of sars at the national and local spatial scales .
80d5f3d9570784069b1a8b6994889272289ec2cc	in the process , the study presents the management of a hazard , in this case , an emerging infectious disease by national health care institutions such as the hospitals that ultimately proved to have been wholly unprepared for coping with at least the health aspects of the outcome of a globalised national agenda for growth and economic progress .
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	the study analyses the role of long - distance travel behaviours on the large - scale spatial spreading of directly transmitted infectious diseases , focusing on two different travel types in terms of the travellers travelling to a specific group or not .
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	for this purpose , we have formulated and analysed a metapopulation model in which the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scalefree contact network .
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	the long - distance travellers between the subpopulations will temporarily change the network structure of the destination subpopulation through the " merging effects ( mes ) , " which indicates that the travellers will be regarded as either connected components or isolated nodes in the contact network .
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	the results show that the presence of the mes has constantly accelerated the transmission of the diseases and aggravated the outbreaks compared to the scenario in which the diversity of the long - distance travel types is arbitrarily discarded .
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	sensitivity analyses show that these results are relatively constant regarding a wide range variation of several model parameters .
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	our study has highlighted several important causes which could significantly affect the spatiotemporal disease dynamics neglected by the present studies .

3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	the analytical performance studies were performed for detection limit , reproducibility , cross - reactivity , and interference .
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	for comparison , 92 norovirus - positive stool samples and 126 norovirus - negative samples for which the results were confirmed by 2 different real - time pcr kits were used .
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	the rapid immunochromatography test detected the equivalent of 4.48 × 10 6 copies / ml of the norovirus genome in stool samples .
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	on performing the repeatability / reproducibility test , samples above this concentration all provided positive results ( 100 % ) and 97.8 % of the samples slightly below this concentration ( 2.45 × 10 6 copies / ml )
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	provided negative results .
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	no cross - reactivity or interference was detected .
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	positive percent agreement ( sensitivity ) , negative percent agreement ( specificity ) , and overall percent agreement of the rapid immunochromatography test compared with testing by real - time pcr were 90.2 % , 100 % , and 95.9 % , respectively .
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	in addition , the rapid immunochromatography test was completed within 20 min .
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	the sd bioline norovirus test was , therefore , easier and more rapid to perform and showed excellent reproducibility , no cross - reactivity , no interference , and high agreement compared with real - time pcr .
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	thus , this test is useful for rapid screening to identity norovirus infection .

aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	inactivation of yoph activity would lead to the loss of bacterial pathogenicity .
aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	we have studied the inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid ( ata ) against yoph phosphatase and found that at nanomolar concentrations ata reversibly decreases the activity of yoph.
aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	computational docking studies indicated that in all binding poses ata binds in the yoph active site .
aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the predicted binding pose , ata binds to the essential cys403 and arg409 residues in the active site and has a stronger binding affinity than the natural substrate ( ptyr ) .
aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	the cyclic voltammetry experiments suggest that ata reacts remarkably strongly with molecular oxygen .
aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	additionally , the electrochemical reduction of ata in the presence of a negative potential from -2.0 to 2.5 v generates a current signal , which is observed for hydrogen peroxide .
aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	here we showed that ata indicates a unique mechanism of yoph inactivation due to a redox process .
aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	we proposed that the potent inhibitory properties of ata are a result of its strong binding in the yoph active site and in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide near catalytic cysteine residue .

de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	the lansing strain of poliovirus type 2 is a mouse - adapted virus that induces a fatal paralytic disease in mice after intracerebral inoculation .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	our previous results indicated that the mouse - adapted phenotype maps to the lansing viral capsid .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	to further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice , antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected , and their mouse neurovirulence was studied .

de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	ten of twenty - two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive ( ts ) for replication in hela cells , while the remaining six variants replicated in hela cells as well as the parent virus .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	two ts+ variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	there was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	in three variants , reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of vp1 , located within antigenic site 1 .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	the ts phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105 .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	in most cases , brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	virus recovered from brains of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the ts variants was either ts+ or cold sensitive , and had become more neurovirulent .
de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	these results suggest that specific amino acid changes within an antigenic site on the virion surface may result in reduction of mouse neurovirulence without affecting viral replication in cultured cells .

f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	background - : genetic testing for hereditary colorectal cancer ( hcrc ) had significant psychological consequences for test recipients .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	this prospective longitudinal study investigated the factors that predict psychological resilience in adults undergoing genetic testing for hcrc .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	on hong kong chinese hcrc family members who were recruited and offered genetic testing by the hereditary gastrointestinal cancer registry to determine psychological outcomes after genetic testing .

f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	four patterns of outcome trajectories were created using established norms for the specified outcome measures of depression and anxiety .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	these included chronic dysfunction ( 13 % and 8.7 % ) , recovery ( 0 % and 4.3 % ) , delayed dysfunction ( 13 % and 15.9 % ) and resilience ( 76.8 % and 66.7 % ) .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	two logistic regression analyses were conducted using hope at baseline to predict resilience , with depression and anxiety employed as outcome indicators .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	because of the small number of participants , the chronic dysfunction and delayed dysfunction groups were combined into a non - resilient group for comparison with the resilient group in all subsequent analysis .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	because of low frequencies , participants exhibiting a recovery trajectory
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	( n = 3 for anxiety and n = 0 for depression ) were excluded from further analysis .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	both regression equations were significant .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	baseline hope was a significant predictor of a resilience outcome trajectory for depression ( b = -0.24 , p < 0.01 for depression ) ; and anxiety
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	( b = -0.11 , p = 0.05 for anxiety ) .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	the current findings suggest that hopefulness may predict resilience after hcrc genetic testing in hong kong chinese .
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	interventions to increase the level of hope may be beneficial to the psychological adjustment of crc genetic testing recipients .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	a fast endospore germinability assay ( ega ) was validated with traditional plate counts to enumerate single endospore germination events for monitoring surface sterilization .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	the assay is based on a time - gated luminescence microscopy technique enabling visualization and enumeration of individual germinating endospores .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	germinating endospores release calcium dipicolinate to form highly luminescent terbium dipicolinate complexes surrounding each germinating endospore .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	ega and heterotrophic plate counting ( hpc ) were used to evaluate the swab / rinse recovery efficiency of endospores from stainless steel surfaces .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	ega and hpc results were highly correlated for endospore recovery from stainless steel coupons inoculated with range of 1,000 endospores per coupon down to sterility .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	dosage - dependent decrease of surface endospore germinability were observed in dry heat , uv irradiation , oxygen plasma and vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatments , measured with ega and hpc .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	ega is a fast and complementary method to traditional hpc for quantitative sterility assurance testing of surfaces .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	this work introduces and validates a 15-minute or faster assay for germinable endospores to complement the conventional lengthy , culture - based surface sterility validation , which is critical in hospitals , food and pharmaceutical industries to help minimize nosocomial infection , food spoilage , and pharmaceutical contamination .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	even before the era of microbiology , people adopted cooking , bathing and washing garments to reduce the devastating effects of disease caused by infectious pathogens 1,2 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	cleansing and purification of materials have been employed to improve human health since roman times , but it was not until the 1800s when louis pasteur and william henry explored pressurized steam for sterilization of contaminated clothing and materials that have been in contact with contagions 3 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	the ongoing co - evolution of pathogen and human has been described as an arms race , where new developments of antimicrobial medicines are overcome by microbes with newly evolved resistance to those drugs 4 - 7 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	indeed , as drug development fails to keep pace with increased microbial resistance , hygiene and monitoring of sterility assurance are becoming increasingly important .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	because of the persistence of nosocomial infections and foodborne diseases , much attention in health care , food and pharmaceutical industries has focused on the need for appropriate surface cleaning , disinfection , and sterility assurance .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	the cleanliness of surfaces , such as walls , countertops , and floors , in hospitals have been shown to correlate with the occurrence of cross - contamination 8 - 11 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	in the food industry , surfaces in contact with food are critical , because food provides nutrients and substrate for microbes to proliferate .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	inadequate cleaning and disinfection of these surfaces put consumers at risk , and leads to food spoilage or shortened shelf lives 12,13 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	quality assurance methods in the pharmaceutical industry to prevent microbial contamination are also strictly regulated to ensure aseptic processing of products 14 , 15 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	sterility assurance is also important in space exploration , where nations are required by international law to ensure that interplanetary spacecraft destined to potentially habitable worlds in our solar system contain less than a specified bioburden 16 , 17 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	for example , mars lander missions without life - detection experiments must meet a bioburden limit of 3 × 10 5 endospores / vehicle , and less than 300 endospores / m 2 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	missions with life - detection experiments must undergo additional procedures to ensure that the total bioburden is even lower 18 .

9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	evaluation of microbial contamination on work surfaces has relied on the swab and rinse sampling techniques and standard heterotrophic plate count ( hpc ) , which have been widely practiced in hospitals , food processing plants , and by nasa for evaluating the bioburden level of flight hardware for planetary protection in robotic extraterrestrial missions 24,25 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	the major drawback is that hpc usually requires several days for results .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	faster and more efficient methods have been proposed in recent years to measure microbial contamination of surfaces , such as atp bioluminescence , enzyme , and nucleic acid - based techniques 26 - 30 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	yet , conventional cleaning practices of surfaces still largely do not include quantitative approaches for assessing the effectiveness of the cleaning regimen , because of cost , ease - of - use , or time - to - results .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	there is a need for fast , quantitative , cost effective and convenient methods to assess the level of contamination on surfaces in tracking routes of infection , surveillance of the environment and evaluation of decontamination protocols .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	the endospore germinability assay ( ega ) addresses this need by enabling the fast measurement of germinable endospore populations , which serve as excellent indicators for measuring surface bioburden reduction , owing to their omnipresence in the environment , and because they are the hardiest microbial organisms .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	consequently , a reduction of viable endospores necessarily indicates an even greater reduction in non - spore forming microorganisms .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	the concept of endospores as bioindicators for monitoring sterilization effectiveness is extensively used in hospitals , where sterilization processes are monitored by using endospores as dosimeters ( e.g. , endospore test strips to verify autoclave compliance with regulatory requirements 31 ) .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	endospore producing genera include geobacillus , bacillus and clostridium , which produce this dormant and resilient form during times of environmental stress .

9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	endospores can remain dormant for many years 35,36 , and when more favorable conditions are signaled by the presence of water , nutrients , and germinants , endospores may germinate and become metabolically active 22 , 37 , 38 .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	in the context of human health , this enables endospore - forming pathogens ( e.g. , b. anthracis , c. botulinum , and c. difficile ) to persist after cleaning regimens are applied , causing contamination , food spoilage , and disease .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	the remarkable resistance of endospores makes them ideal bioindicators for both sterility assurance of sterilizers and of surfaces in work environments of health care , food and pharmaceutical industries , and for planetary protection as humans continue to explore potentially habitable worlds in the solar systems .
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	we have previously reported on germinable - endospore biodosimetry using ega to achieve rapid validation of sterilization in aqueous suspensions 39 .

376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	hepaciviruses have been identified in several domestic and wild mammals , the largest viral diversity being observed in bats and rodents .
376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	the closest relatives of hcv were found in horses / donkeys ( equine hepaciviruses , ehv ) .
376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	however , the origin of hcv as a human pathogen is still an unsolved puzzle .
376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	using a selection - informed evolutionary model , we show that the common ancestor of extant hcv genotypes existed at least 3000 years ago ( ci : 3192 - 5221 years ago ) , with the oldest genotypes being endemic to asia .

376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	these time estimates exclude that ehv transmission was mainly sustained by widespread veterinary practices and suggest that hcv originated from a single zoonotic event with subsequent diversification in human populations .

376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	hcv exploits several cell - surface molecules for cell entry , but only two of these ( cd81 and ocln ) determine the species - specificity of infection .
376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	herein evolutionary analyses do not support a long - standing association between primates and hepaciviruses , and signals of positive selection at cd81 were only observed in chiroptera .
376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	no evidence of selection was detected for ocln in any mammalian order .
376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	these results shed light on the origin of hcv and provide a catalog of candidate genetic modulators of hcv phenotypic diversity .

90ba51f14fa67f67464a1ff3688f3ec3af4fcd78	we analyzed laboratory - confirmed covid-19 case data for 150 upper tier local 19 authorities , from the period from january 30 to may 6 , 2020 , as reported by public health 20 england .
90ba51f14fa67f67464a1ff3688f3ec3af4fcd78	using methods suitable for time - series data , we identified clusters of local authorities 21 with distinct trajectories of daily cases , after adjusting for population size .
90ba51f14fa67f67464a1ff3688f3ec3af4fcd78	we then tested for 22 differences in sociodemographic , economic , and health disparity factors between these clusters .
90ba51f14fa67f67464a1ff3688f3ec3af4fcd78	23 24 results : two clusters of local authorities were identified : a higher case trajectory that rose faster 25 over time to reach higher peak infection levels , and a lower case trajectory cluster that emerged 26 more slowly , and had a lower peak .
90ba51f14fa67f67464a1ff3688f3ec3af4fcd78	the higher case trajectory cluster ( 79 local authorities ) had 27 higher population density ( p<0.001 ) , higher proportion of black and asian residents ( p=0.03 ; 28 p=0.02 ) , higher multiple deprivation scores ( p<0.001 ) , a lower proportions of older adults 29 ( p=0.005 ) , and higher preventable mortality rates ( p=0.03 ) .
90ba51f14fa67f67464a1ff3688f3ec3af4fcd78	local authorities with higher 30 proportions of black residents were more likely to belong to the high case trajectory cluster , even 31 after adjusting for population density , deprivation , proportion of older adults and preventable 32 mortality ( p=0.04 ) .

54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	methods :
54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	in this retrospective national - based study , we analyzed the medical records of all sars - cov-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to new - jahra hospital , kuwait , between march 15 th 2020 and may 31 st 2020 .
54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	the outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow - up ( june 15 th 2020 ) .
54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	results :
54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	a total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years ( interquartile range , iqr : 27.5 - 34 ) , and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks
54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	( iqr : 18 - 34 ) .
54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	the majority ( 88 % ) of the patients had mild symptoms , with fever ( 58 % ) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough ( 50.6 % ) .
54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	during the study period , 141 ( 76.2 % )

54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the management of pregnancies complicated with sars - cov-2 infection .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	leishmaniasis and chagas disease are endemic in many countries , and re - emerging in the developed countries .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	a rapid and accurate diagnosis is important for early treatment for reducing the duration of infection as well as for preventing further potential health complications .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	in this work , we have developed a novel colorimetric molecular assay that integrates nucleic acid analysis by dynamic chemistry ( chemnat ) with reverse dot - blot hybridization in an array format for a rapid and easy discrimination of leishmania major and trypanosoma cruzi .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the assay consists of a singleplex pcr step that amplifies a highly homologous dna sequence which encodes for the rna component of the large ribosome subunit .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the amplicons of the two different parasites differ between them by single nucleotide variations , known as " single nucleotide fingerprint " ( snf ) markers .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the snf markers can be easily identified by naked eye using a novel micro spin - tube device " spin - tube " , as each of them creates a specific spot pattern .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	moreover , the direct use of ribosomal rna without requiring the pcr pre - amplification step is also feasible , further increasing the simplicity of the assay .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the molecular assay delivers sensitivity capable of identifying up to 8.7 copies per µl with single mismatch specificity .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the spin - tube thus represents an innovative solution providing benefits in terms of time , cost , and simplicity , all of which are crucial for the diagnosis of infectious disease in developing countries .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	parasitic diseases not only cause millions of deaths per year , but also have serious health and economic consequences 1 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	among all the parasitic diseases , protozoan parasites of the family trypanosomatidae are responsible for devastating diseases in humans , dogs as well as livestock , resulting in severe illness or even death if left untreated 1,2 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the protozoa trypanosoma cruzi ( t. cruzi ) and leishmania spp .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	are the causative agents of chagas disease and leishmaniasis respectively 3 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	even though these diseases are endemic in tropical and sub - tropical regions of the world , in the last decades there has been a re - emergence also in developed countries , with international travel being responsible for increases in reported cases of trypanosomatidae infections in non - endemic countries 1,4 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	consequently , these parasitic infections have become a more important public health issue of global relevance .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	even though there are several methods available for the screening of parasitic infections , however , they have not yet changed dramatically the diagnosis in developing countries .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	microscopic identification and parasite cultivation are still the primary diagnostic tools employed in many regions where leishmaniasis is endemic 5 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	these methods , unfortunately , require extended incubation times and are expensive , requiring specialized equipment and highly trained personnel 6 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	on the other hand , standard serological approaches that could potentially prove to be timely and cost effective for diagnosing parasitic infections are of limited value , as most patients do not develop a significant antibody response 7 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	in addition , and problematically for clinicians attempting to make an accurate diagnosis , t. cruzi and leishmania spp .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	share various antigens
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	that cause cross - reactivity in serological diagnosis when complex antigenic mixtures are used 8 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	as a result , nucleic acid testing ( nat ) methodologies have become valuable methods for the routine and accurate assessment of parasitic infectious diseases .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	nat benefits from the presence of specific nucleic acid fragments for determining the presence / absence of pathogens 3,9 - 13 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	there are different methods ranging from probe hybridization , amplification of genomic targets and sequencing of nucleic acid fragments .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the use of nucleic acid amplification techniques ( naats ) such as polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , real - time pcr or nucleic acid sequence
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	based amplification ( nasba ) can be very useful in detecting infections and post - treatment monitoring 9,13,14 , including detection and distinguishing of parasites using single base resolution methods such as single base extension ( sbe ) .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	primers are designed to hybridize to a complementary nucleic acid region such that the 3′ end of the primer finishes immediately before the nucleotide under interrogation 15 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	however , while nat has the advantage of being sensitive , there are some limitations , as the nat methodologies have complex protocols , require technical expertise to run and interpret data ( not cost - effective ) , and utilize equipment that is incompatible with use in remote and low - resource locations , such as developing countries where diagnostic laboratories are often poorly resourced and sparsely distributed 16 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	thus , there is an urgent need for early detection of infectious disease with improved , simple and low - cost alternative tests not requiring expensive laboratory equipment to be performed .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	to sum up , while laboratory - based models require benchtop laboratory facilities and complex procedures , point - of - care testing allows a more decentralized diagnostic analysis with additional advantages such as portability , automation , shorter time - to - results and lower cost

4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the world health organization ( who ) is consistently encouraging developers to implement these new diagnostic technologies for improved effective clinical management and treatment of the major infections suitable in developing countries context 20,21 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	these diagnostic devices should follow who criteria , the assured acronym ( affordable , sensitive , specific , user - friendly , rapid and robust , equipment - free and deliverable )
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	22,23 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	following this encouragement , zhang et al .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	recently developed a low - cost crispr - based diagnostic ( crispr - dx ) for detecting dna or rna molecules of pathogenic species with single mismatch specificity 24,25 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	besides the tests available today 19,26 , our group has recently reported the successful detection and differentiation of three trypanosomatids species , by detecting single nucleotide fingerprint ( snf ) markers using a dynamic chemical approach for nucleic acid reading ( chemnat technology )
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	27,28 in combination with maldi - tof 29 .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	snf markers are single nucleotide variations that occur at specific positions in conserved target nucleic acid sequences , allowing the differentiation of pathogenic species .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	as a result , these snf represents the perfect target to be interrogated by the chemnat technology through the specific dynamic incorporation of aldehyde - modified smart - nucleobases into the abasic position of abasic pna probes .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	despite its high specificity , the use of this method has limitations , with higher cost and complex instrumentation
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	( maldi - tof ) required , making this approach unsuitable for diagnosis of parasitic infections in developing countries .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	here , we report the adaptation of our previous method onto a colorimetric reverse dot - blot 30 - 35 assay that has the potential to fulfil the who assured criteria , for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis and chagas disease .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	this novel method combines chemnat technology with a simple colorimetric end - point assay on a porous nylon membrane contained within a micro spin - tube device ( spin - tube ) .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the assay uses a singleplex pcr to amplify a highly conserved sequence of dna , which encodes the rna component of the large ribosome subunit with snf markers for the two different parasite species under interrogation .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	this amplicon is later interrogated by the chemnat technology that relies on a dynamic chemical approach for nucleic acid testing .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	as shown in fig . 1 , the snf sequence analysis is based on combining biotinylated aldehyde - modified cytosine ( smart - c - biotin ) with unique abasic pna probes to target pcr amplicon strands , such that a nucleobase - free position on the pna strand ( known as ' abasic ' position ) lies opposite to two different nucleotides under interrogation on the dna amplicons .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	a reversible reaction between the smart - c - biotin and a free secondary amine on the abasic pna probes generates an iminium intermediate , which can be chemically reduced to a stable tertiary amine .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	within the novel spin - tube , the dynamic chemistry reaction mixture is added to the nylon membranes on which the abasic pna probes have been immobilized following a specific spot pattern ( fig . 1 , step 1 ) .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the pcr amplicons act as template molecules and drive the specific incorporation of smart - c - biotin molecules into a specific abasic pna according to watson - crick dna base pairing model in which the smart - cytosine , in this case carrying a biotin tag , is only recognized by a guanidine nucleotide
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	( fig . 1 , step 2 ) .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	the labelling is then achieved by streptavidin alkaline phosphatase ( streptavidin - alp ) to produce colorimetric signal ( blue precipitate ) patterns when the chromogenic substrate ( nbt / bcip , nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate ) is added .
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	each parasite gives a unique colored spot pattern that can be read by naked - eye ( fig . 1 , step 3 ) .

467240da5b8636371c3eef393595ca39194c9e7c	due to its relatively higher sensitivity in response to toxicants , the use of lung epithelial cell culture and lung tissue from animal models or patients has facilitated our learning to lung physiopathology and toxicopharmacology .
467240da5b8636371c3eef393595ca39194c9e7c	the recent advancement of proteomics has made it possible to investigate the cellular response at a global level .

c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	systemic infection triggers a spectrum of metabolic and behavioral changes , collectively termed sickness behavior , which while adaptive , can affect mood and cognition .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	in vulnerable individuals , acute illness can also produce profound , maladaptive , cognitive dysfunction including delirium , but our understanding of delirium pathophysiology remains limited .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	here , we used bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) in female c57bl/6j mice and acute hip fracture in humans to address whether disrupted energy metabolism
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	contributes to inflammation - induced behavioral and cognitive changes .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	lps ( 250 mg / kg ) induced hypoglycemia , which was mimicked by interleukin ( il)-1b ( 25 mg / kg ) but not prevented in il-1ri 2/2 mice , nor by il-1 receptor antagonist ( il-1ra ; 10 mg / kg ) .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	lps suppression of locomotor activity correlated with blood glucose concentrations , was mitigated by exogenous glucose ( 2 g / kg ) , and was exacerbated by 2-deoxyglucose ( 2-dg ) glycolytic inhibition , despite preventing il-1b synthesis .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	using the me7 model of chronic neurodegeneration in female mice , to examine vulnerability of the diseased brain to acute stressors , we showed that lps ( 100 mg / kg ) produced acute cognitive dysfunction , selectively in those animals .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	these acute cognitive impairments were mimicked by insulin ( 11.5 iu / kg ) and mitigated by glucose , demonstrating that acutely reduced glucose metabolism impairs cognition selectively in the vulnerable brain .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	to test whether these acute changes might predict altered carbohydrate metabolism during delirium , we assessed glycolytic metabolite levels in csf in humans during inflammatory trauma - induced delirium .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	hip fracture patients showed elevated csf lactate and pyruvate during delirium , consistent with acutely altered brain energy metabolism .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	collectively , the data suggest that disruption of energy metabolism drives behavioral and cognitive consequences of acute systemic inflammation .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	acute systemic inflammation alters behavior and produces disproportionate effects , such as delirium , in vulnerable individuals .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	delirium has serious short and long - term sequelae but mechanisms remain unclear .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	here , we show that both lps and interleukin ( il)-1b trigger hypoglycemia , reduce csf glucose , and suppress spontaneous activity .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	exogenous glucose mitigates these outcomes .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	equivalent hypoglycemia , induced by lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) or insulin , was sufficient to trigger cognitive impairment selectively in animals with existing neurodegeneration and glucose also mitigated those impairments .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	patient csf from inflammatory trauma - induced delirium also shows altered brain carbohydrate metabolism .
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	the data suggest that the degenerating brain is exquisitely sensitive to acute behavioral and cognitive consequences of disrupted energy metabolism .

e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	our previous study
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	, we have shown that canine coronavirus type ii ( ccov - ii ) activates both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a canine fibrosarcoma cell line ( a-72 cells ) .
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	herein we investigated the role of sirtuin and forkhead box o ( foxo ) families in this experimental model using nortern blot and western blot analysis .
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	our results demonstrated that mitochondrial sirt3 and sirt4 protein expression increased from 12 and 24 h post infection ( p.i . )
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	onwards , respectively , whereas the nuclear sirt1 expression increased during the first 12 h p.i . followed by a decrease after 36 h p.i . , reaching the same level of control at 48 h
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	p.i . sirtuins interact with / and regulate the activity of foxo family proteins , and we herein observed that foxo3a and foxo1 expression increased significantly and stably from 12 h p.i . onwards .
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	in addition , ccov - ii induces a remarkable increase in the expression of tnf - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( trail ) , while we observed a slight up - regulation of fasl / fas at 36 p.i . with a decrease of both proteins at the end of infection .
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	furthermore , we found that virus infection increased both bax translocation into mitochondria and decreased bcl-2 expression in cytosol in a timedependent manner .
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	these data suggest that foxo transcription factors mediate pro - apoptotic effects of ccov - ii , in part due to activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway , while some sirtuin family members ( such as sirt3 and sirt4 ) may be involved in intrinsic apoptotic pathway .
e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	moreover , these results propose that trail is an important mediator of cell death induced by ccov - ii during in vitro infection .

fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	in order to protect consumers ' health and to enhance the management of food - borne zoonotic agents from primary production to consumption , new regulations have been issued in the european union .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	these regulations notably require information concerning each step from farm to slaughterhouse .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	today , pork is the most frequently consumed meat in europe .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	•
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	in this context , the purpose of this review was to collect information on risk factors on pig farms regarding the prevalence of four bacterial hazards responsible for frequent and/or serious pork - borne diseases : campylobacter spp . , listeria monocytogenes , salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	among the risk factors described in the literature , feed , herd management and biosecurity measures have been shown to greatly impact the prevalence of these hazards .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	these risk factors may be used as information on the primary production of the pork food chain transmitted from farm to slaughterhouse .

fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	the application of good hygiene practices in herds is paramount to reduce the risk of presence of food - borne pathogens .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	as a priority in biosecurity measures , limiting the mixing of pig batches is needed .

fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	prevalence estimates of these four hazards are affected by the sampling strategy and diagnostic procedure .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	individual prevalence estimates for pig carriage ( from digestive contents or lymph nodes collected at slaughterhouse ) were higher than individual prevalence estimates for pig shedding ( from faeces ) .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	among risk factors described in the literature , poor pen cleaning and disinfection after pig departure to slaughterhouse and poor bio - security measures are of major significance .
fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	moreover , whereas wet feed increases the risk of pig infection by l. monocytogenes , dry feed is a risk factor for salm .

272c86bee233aeae771807ee609256fe9e61f650	although there appears to be growing evidence of their benefit , questions linger regarding how to leverage existing social media platforms to promote hiv testing , which interventions work for what populations , and best practices for scaling up mhealth and other technology - based interventions .
e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	currently there is no effective antiviral therapy for sars - cov-2 infection , which frequently leads to fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury .
e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	here , we discuss the various mechanisms of sars - cov - mediated inflammation .
e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	we also assume that sars - cov-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses .
e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	potential therapeutic tools to reduce sars - cov-2 -induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block fcr activation .
e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	in the absence of a proven clinical fcr blocker , the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block fcr activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury .
e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti - inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids .
e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	however , these strategies , as proposed here , remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness .

d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	isatis indigotica , the source of the traditional chinese medicine radix isatidis ( ban - lan - gen ) , is an extremely important economical crop in china .
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	to facilitate biological , biochemical and molecular research on the medicinal chemicals in i. indigotica , here we report the first i. indigotica transcriptome generated by rna sequencing ( rna - seq ) .
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	results :
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	rna - seq library was created using rna extracted from a mixed sample including leaf and root .
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	a total of 33,238 unigenes were assembled from more than 28 million of high quality short reads .
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	the quality of the assembly was experimentally examined by cdna sequencing of seven randomly selected unigenes .
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	based on blast search 28,184 unigenes had a hit in at least one of the protein and nucleotide databases used in this study , and 8 unigenes were found to be associated with biosynthesis of indole and its derivatives .
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	according to gene ontology classification , 22,365 unigenes were categorized into 48 functional groups .
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	furthermore , clusters of orthologous group and swiss - port annotation were assigned for 7,707 and 18,679 unigenes , respectively .
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	analysis of repeat motifs identified 6,400 simple sequence repeat markers in 4,509 unigenes .

5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	the emergence of neurotropic zika virus ( zikv ) raised a public health emergency of global concern .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	zikv can cross the placental barrier and infect foetal brains , resulting in microcephaly , but the pathogenesis of zikv is poorly understood .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	with recent findings reporting axl as a type i interferon antagonist rather than an entry receptor , the exact entry mechanism remains unresolved .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	here we report that cell surface sialic acid plays an important role in zikv infection .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	removal of cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase significantly abolished zikv infection in vero cells and human induced - pluripotent stem cells - derived neural progenitor cells .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	furthermore , knockout of the sialic acid biosynthesis gene encoding udp - n - acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase / n - acetylmannosamine kinase resulted in significantly less zikv infection of both african and asian lineages .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	huh7 cells deficient in α2,3-linked sialic acid through knockout of st3 βgalactoside - α2,3-sialyltransferase 4 had significantly reduced zikv infection .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	removal of membrane - bound , uninternalized virus with pronase treatment revealed the role of sialic acid in zikv internalization but not attachment .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	sialyllactose inhibition studies showed that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and zikv , implying that sialic acid could be mediating zikv - receptor complex internalization .
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	identification of α2,3-linked sialic acid as an important host factor for zikv internalization provides new insight into zikv infection and pathogenesis .

13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	thus , this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting .
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	as the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world , more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases .
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	from india two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in genbank .
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	we have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the indian isolates and compared with that of the wuhan , china ( where the outbreak was first reported ) .
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	while all the sequences of wuhan isolates are identical , we found point mutations in the indian isolates .
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its receptor binding domain ( rbd ) at position 407 .
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	at this site arginine ( a positively charged amino acid ) was replaced by isoleucine ( a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a c - beta branched amino acid ) .
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	this mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus .
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing , the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering .

17473d144b25b1afab4d6e98b4b8de2ab7507679	in previous work we have screened several large compound libraries against blood stage plasmodium falciparum parasites and identified a number of novel active scaffolds and successfully advanced two new antimalarial drug candidates to the clinic 36 .
17473d144b25b1afab4d6e98b4b8de2ab7507679	our p. falciparum phenotypic screening efforts identified multiple new targets including the atp - dependent sodium channel pfatp4 9 , phosphatidylinositol-4-oh - kinase 12 , and lysyl - trna synthetase 37 .
17473d144b25b1afab4d6e98b4b8de2ab7507679	while cryptosporidium is an early branching member of the apicomplexa and exhibits phylogenetic divergence from other members of the phylum , several druggable targets are conserved 38,39 .
17473d144b25b1afab4d6e98b4b8de2ab7507679	to explore functional conservation of targets and pathways across parasites and to identify lead candidates against cryptosporidium , we have assembled a " nitd parasite box " and screened it against c. parvum as described in the supplementary table 1 .

ff6f7ec41fcfb1353aea25253c33ae25469f6a07	in 2003 the uk national blood service introduced a policy of ' male donor preference ' which involved women 's plasma being discarded following blood collection .
ff6f7ec41fcfb1353aea25253c33ae25469f6a07	the policy was based on the view that data relating to the incidence of transfusion - related acute lung injury ( trali ) was linked to transfusion with women 's plasma .
ff6f7ec41fcfb1353aea25253c33ae25469f6a07	while appearing to treat female donors as equal to male donors , exclusion criteria operate after donation at the stage of processing blood , thus perpetuating myths of universality even though only certain ' extractions ' from women are retained for use in transfusion .

e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	background / case studies :
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	19 different monoclonal anti - d reagents have been tested in humans , but have not shown equivalent efficacy as donor derived polyclonal anti - d.
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	in addition , some monoclonal anti - d results in a paradoxical enhancement of alloimmunization , an effect also seen with donor derived anti - d in some cases .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	k1 transgenic mice express the human k1 rbc alloantigen selectively on rbcs .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	wild - type mice become alloimmunized to k1 rbcs , when exposed through either transfusion or pregnancy , the latter leading to hdfn .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	analogous to anti - d in humans , polyclonal mouse serum derived anti - k1 prevents alloimmunization .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	thus , the k1 mouse serves as a model of antibody mediated immune regulation of alloimmunization .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	study design / methods :
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	igg subtype was isolated as an independent variable by engineering a panel of igg subtype switch variants for a monoclonal anti - k1 .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	monoclonal anti - k1 was isolated for each murine igg subtype ( igg1 , igg2a , igg2b , igg2c and igg3 ) and each with the same antigenbinding domain .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	the effects of igg subtype on clearance and alloimmunization to transfused k1 rbcs was tested .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	the role of fcgriib ( the inhibitory fcgr in mice and humans ) was tested using fcgriib ko mice .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	the role of activating fcgrs ( afcgr ) was tested using a novel conditional knockout mouse ( con - fcgr ) where the common gamma chain ( required for expression of all murine afcgrs ) is deleted upon exposure to cre recombinase .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	results / findings :
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	significant clearance of k11 rbcs was observed with igg1 , igg2a , and igg2c , but not igg2b or igg3 .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	igg1 and igg3 significantly decrease , whereas igg2a , igg2b , and igg2c increased anti - k1 alloimmunization .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	igg1 and igg2c were further studied , as examples of suppressing and enhancing antibodies .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	in fcgriib ko mice , clearance was unaffected , suppression by igg1 was eliminated , and enhancement by igg2a was not altered .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	when afcgrs were deleted in all tissues , no clearance was observed with either subtype , enhancement by igg2c was eliminated , and suppression by igg1 was unaffected .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	tissue specific deletion of afcgrs demonstrated that afcgr expression on dendritic cells ( dcs ) [ and not macrophages ] was required for enhancement by igg2c .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	conclusion :
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	similar to what is observed in humans , some monoclonal anti - rbc antibodies prevented alloimmunization whereas others enhanced .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	igg subtype determined inhibition vs. enhancement .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	inhibition by igg1 functions through an fcgriib dependent mechanism .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	also , lack of clearance but maintenance of suppression by igg1 in mice
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	lacking afcgrs indicates clearance is not required for suppression , a finding consistent with data from other murine and some human studies .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	enhancement by igg2a requires expression of afcgrs by dcs .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	follow up studies will be required to see if these findings translate into humans .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	background / case studies : transfusion - related acute lung injury ( trali ) remains the most common cause of death from blood transfusion therapy .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	a mouse model of trali relies on the administration of a mhc class i ( mhc i )
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	monoclonal antibody ( mab ) to mice with cognate mhc
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	i antigen ; however , the critical site(s ) of cognate antigen expression have not been elucidated .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	we hypothesized that endothelial expression of mhc i is necessary for the development of trali .

e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	trali was modeled by the injection of a mhc i mab ( h-2 k d ; 34 - 1 - 2s ) into lps - primed mice ( 0.1 mg / kg , i.p . ) .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	lung injury was measured using extravascular lung water and lung vascular permeability to 125 i - labelled albumin .
e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	to measure the endothelial expression of mhc i within the lung , the left lung was removed for mhc i quantification using flow cytometry .

20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	sars - cov-2 is an rna virus of the coronaviridae family that is the causal pathogen of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	there are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat covid-19 , and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	here , we experimentally determined structural maps of the sars - cov-2 rna genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded rna structures for sars - cov-2 and 6 other coronaviruses .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	importantly , we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep - learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the sars - cov-2 rna genome , none of which were known previously .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	thus , our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus rna biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat covid-19 .
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	l we mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the sars - cov-2 rna genome

20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	we predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the sars - cov-2 rna genome based on our in vivo rna structural data using a deep - learning tool
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	flavivirus methyltransferase is a genetically - validated antiviral target .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	crystal structures of almost all available flavivirus methyltransferases contain s - adenosyl - l - methionine ( sam ) , the methyl donor molecule that co - purifies with the enzymes .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	this raises a possibility that sam is an integral structural component required for the folding of dengue virus ( denv ) methyltransferase .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	here we exclude this possibility by solving the crystal structure of denv methyltransferase without sam .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	the sam ligand was removed from the enzyme through a urea - mediated denaturation - and - renaturation protocol .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	the crystal structure of the sam - depleted enzyme exhibits a vacant sam - binding pocket , with a conformation identical to that of the sam - enzyme co - crystal structure .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	functionally , equivalent enzymatic activities ( n-7 methylation , 2 0 -o methylation , and gmp - enzyme complex formation ) were detected for the sam - depleted and samcontaining recombinant proteins .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	these results clearly indicate that the sam molecule is not an essential component for the correct folding of denv methyltransferase .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	furthermore , the results imply a potential antiviral approach to search for inhibitors that can bind to the sam - binding pocket and compete against sam binding .
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	to demonstrate this potential , we have soaked crystals of denv methyltransferase without a bound sam with the natural product sinefungin and show that preformed crystals are capable of binding ligands in this pocket .

f62d6cfd82d37b21edee19f95cd253094fc58e68	professional caregivers working in child and youth welfare institutions are frequently faced with the complex mental health issues , emotional needs and challenging coping strategies of clients with cumulated traumatic experiences , leaving them prone to developing high levels of stress , burn - out and compassion fatigue .
f62d6cfd82d37b21edee19f95cd253094fc58e68	trauma - informed care ( tic ) is a milieu - therapeutic approach that aims to promote the self - efficacy and self - care of youth welfare staff by guiding them to a better understanding of their own and their clients ' stress symptoms and countertransference .
f62d6cfd82d37b21edee19f95cd253094fc58e68	despite increasing efforts to implement tic practices , and more widespread recognition of their value in youth welfare systems , there is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of this approach .
f62d6cfd82d37b21edee19f95cd253094fc58e68	the aim of this study was to assess the effects of tic practices in youth welfare institutions on both the physiological stress of staff members and clients ' physical aggression towards their caregivers . .
f62d6cfd82d37b21edee19f95cd253094fc58e68	data was obtained from a longitudinal study investigating the effectiveness of tic in 14 residential youth welfare institutions .
f62d6cfd82d37b21edee19f95cd253094fc58e68	our sample consisted of 47 youth welfare employees ( 66.0 % female ) aged from 23 to 60 years ( m = 37.4 , sd = 10.4 years ) .

c24147d477e3b1e01c3567a3f983a178a224f4a3	to study the underlying mechanisms , we have developed a ferret model of canine distemper virus infection .
c24147d477e3b1e01c3567a3f983a178a224f4a3	the model reproduces all clinical signs of measles , but the lack of ferret - specific reagents has limited the characterization of the cellular immune response .
c24147d477e3b1e01c3567a3f983a178a224f4a3	towards this , we cloned ferret cytokines and established semi - quantitative real - time pcr assays .
c24147d477e3b1e01c3567a3f983a178a224f4a3	to demonstrate the utility of these assays we compared the cytokine profiles elicited by lethal and non - lethal strains during the prodromal phase .
c24147d477e3b1e01c3567a3f983a178a224f4a3	we observed a general lack of cytokine induction in animals that later succumbed to the disease , whereas survivors mounted a robust and sustained response .

cbf789657270a691a532fbf24f326b2bbb2775f1	the partial unlock could be for example 3 full working days per week .
cbf789657270a691a532fbf24f326b2bbb2775f1	given that 10 not all areas or individuals will respond , and travel and public gatherings are still unlikely , the partial 11 unlock might be 5 full working days per week .
cbf789657270a691a532fbf24f326b2bbb2775f1	the model can be regionalized easily , and by 12 expediting the resolution of the pandemic in the u.s. medical equipment and volunteers , many of them 13 with already acquired immunity , can be made available to other countries .

5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	recent years have witnessed the emergence of novel models for ad - hoc entity search in knowledge graphs of varying complexity .
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	since these models are based on direct term matching , their accuracy can suffer from a mismatch between vocabularies used in queries and entity descriptions .
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	although successful applications of word embeddings and knowledge graph entity embeddings to address the issues of vocabulary mismatch in ad - hoc document retrieval and knowledge graph noisiness and incompleteness , respectively , have been reported in recent literature , the utility of joint word and entity embeddings for entity search in knowledge graphs has been relatively unexplored .
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	in this paper , we propose knowledge graph entity and word embedding for retrieval ( kewer ) , a novel method to embed entities and words into the same low - dimensional vector space , which takes into account a knowledge graph 's local structure and structural components , such as entities , attributes , and categories , and is designed specifically for entity search .
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	kewer is based on random walks over the knowledge graph and can be considered as a hybrid of word and network embedding methods .
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	similar to word embedding methods
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	, kewer utilizes contextual co - occurrences as training data , however , it treats words and entities as different objects .
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	similar to network embedding methods , kewer takes into account knowledge graph 's local structure , however , it also differentiates between structural components .
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	experiments on publicly available entity search benchmarks and state - ofthe - art word and joint word and entity embedding methods indicate that a combination of kewer and bm25f results in a consistent improvement in retrieval accuracy over bm25f alone .
b5e0c949c62ffb50fd2033020227550b49522cf1	using a high - throughput dna sequencing method , one dna sequence ( contig01006 ) , suspected to belong to a novel porcine bocavirus ( pbov ) , was found with a high rate of detection ( 19.6 % ) in fecal samples from healthy piglets .
b5e0c949c62ffb50fd2033020227550b49522cf1	moreover , a novel pbov ( tentatively named pbov3c ) with a nearly complete genome sequence ( 5235 bp ) was identified .
b5e0c949c62ffb50fd2033020227550b49522cf1	pbov3c exhibits typical genome characteristics of bocaviruses and shows the highest genomic sequence identity ( 78 % to 81 % ) to pbov3a / b ( pbov3/4-uk ) and pbov3d / e ( pbov3/4-hk ) , respectively .
b5e0c949c62ffb50fd2033020227550b49522cf1	phylogenetic and recombination analysis indicated high diversity , prevalence and complexity among the pbovs .
b5e0c949c62ffb50fd2033020227550b49522cf1	the phospholipase a2 ( pla2 ) site of vp1 and the secondary structure of vp2 of pbov3c were also analyzed .
b5e0c949c62ffb50fd2033020227550b49522cf1	additionally , we propose a uniform method of pbov nomenclature based on the vp1 gene .

8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	p450s are integral membrane proteins bound to the membrane through their n - terminal transmembrane hydrophobic segment , the signal anchor sequence .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	to elucidate the determinants that enable the p450s to be located in the er , we constructed cdnas
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	encoding chimeric proteins in which a secretory form of carboxyesterase , carboxyesterase sec , was connected to the n - terminus of the full - length or truncated forms of a microsomal - type p450 , p45o{m1 ) , and the constructed plasmids were expressed in cos cells .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	since carboxyesterase sec is an iv - glycosylated secretory protein , endo h treatment could be used to determine whether these chimeric proteins were located in the er or not .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	carboxyesterase sec with the n - terminal 20 amino acids , containing the transmembrane region , of p45o(m1 ) , was located in the er , as determined from the endo h sensitivity of the expressed protein and immunofluorescence staining of the cells .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	as the expressed protein exhibited carboxyesterase activity , it was not retained in the er through the bip - dependent quality control system recognizing unfolded proteins .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	another chimeric protein constrict in which carboxyesterase sec was connected to the c - terminal region of rat udp - glucuronosyltransferase
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	( udp - gt ) , that contained a double - lysin er retention motif , was also located in the er , as determined from the endo h sensitivity and immunofluorescence staining .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	on the other hand , the sugar moiety of the carboxyesterase sec connected to the transmembrane segment of udp - gt , sec / gtd , was partially resistant to the endo h treatment .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	from the results of immunofluorescent staining and cell fractionation , it was concluded that the sec / gtd product was located in the golgi apparatus .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	these observations indicated that the n - terminal hydrophobic segment of p45o(m1 ) is sufficient for the er membrane retention , whereas the transmembrane segment of udp - gt is not .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	to determine whether microsomal p450s are recycled between the er and golgi compartments or not , a dna construct encoding cathepsin d connected to the n - terminus of p45o(m1 ) was prepared and expressed in cos cells .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	the fusion protein was phosphorylated , but the phosphorylation was sensitive to alkaline phosphatase .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	as a control , authentic cathepsin d was subjected to phosphorylation of its oligosaccharide chain that was resistant to the alkaline phosphatase treatment .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	since glcnac - p - transferase , which forms the alkaline phosphatase - resistant phosphodiester in the sugar chains of lysosome - targeting proteins , is located in the golgi apparatus , it was concluded that the oligosaccharide chain of the cathepsin d portion of the fusion protein was not phosphorylated , and that the chimeric protein did not go to the golgi apparatus .
8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	these results indicate that p45o(m1 ) is not recycled from the golgi compartments to the er in cells .

cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	: we collected epidemiological data , obtained a video record and a patron seatingarrangement from the restaurant , and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	we compared the in - room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus - laden aerosol tracer .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	the ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	results :
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	three families ( a , b , c ) , 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with sars - cov-2 at this time , or previously , ate lunch at restaurant x on chinese new year 's eve ( january 24 , 2020 ) at three neighboring tables .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	subsequently , three members of family b and two members of family c became infected with sars - cov-2 , whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	during this occasion , the ventilation rate was 0.75 - 1.04 l / s per person .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	no close contact or fomite contact was observed , aside from back - to - back sitting by some patrons .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus - laden aerosols .
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	conclusions :
cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a	aerosol transmission of sars - cov-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of covid-19 .

9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	for this purpose , a unique multi - mediation model is proposed to provide a new direction for research in the field of epidemic outbreaks and their control .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	through random sampling , an online survey was conducted and data from 683participants were analyzed .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships between the variables of interest .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the study results revealed that the roles of e - government and covid-19 word of mouth are positively related to online social presence during the outbreak .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	epidemic protection and attitude toward epidemic outbreak were found to positively moderate the impact of the role of e - government and covid-19 word of mouth on online social presence during the outbreak .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the key findings of this study have both practical and academic implications .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	health protection .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	this phenomenon encouraged us to formulate a theoretical model based on social presence theory and the role of social media to help examine safety and participation in quarantine .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the conceptual model is presented in figure 1 .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	word of mouth can be defined as " the intention to share a certain story using one 's own social media account " [ 2 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	many researchers proved that communication has more of an impact through social media with regards to different health issues , and message sharing was found to be the best predictor of emotive and passionate response [ 3 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	online health information is regularly updated [ 4 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	nowadays , universal and worldwide flow can not be ignored [ 5 ] and search engines are the most effective method to find information [ 6 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the internet is also a useful source for people in the medical field for discussions and interactions about medical issues [ 7 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	a nine - year big data study showed that the use of computers projected emotive improvement [ 8 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	from the health protection point of view , many factors were found to affect the dispersal of cancer information , including anxiety , courage , anticipation , and sharing of experience [ 9 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	a study proved that the gestation time of infection ( corona virus ) was assessed at about 2 - 14 days [ 7 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	so , a research question was raised about protection during an epidemic outbreak .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	social media campaigns with complete research frameworks with theoretical and statistical support for these time
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	periods are essentially to protect society during emergencies .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	to address this need , our research model includes the factors that trigger safety campaigns and the main effects ( direct ) of direct relations and the association of mediators on online social presence .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the literature shows that for different disease management programmers , among health experts , the most important aspects are self - value , the individual 's reputation [ 10 ] , and sharing their familiarity and information .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	however , this issue is seldom observed within a framework of online health communities [ 10 ] because , with the spread of disease contacts , heterogeneity is critical [ 11 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	public health moved to a wider political regime from health - dedicated management in 2013 in england as public health functions were relocated to local management from the national health service ( nhs )
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	[ 12 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	acceptance of a meningococcal vaccine was unidentified by inspiration of schools [ 13 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	by keeping an individual 's record , doctors can assess body mass index ( bmi ) and threats to health more accurately and precisely .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	sharing opinions and views on actual proceedings is easy with the help of the internet [ 14 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	paying attention to the sharing of data determines self - assurance [ 15 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	in the case of failure , specifically in nepal [ 16 ] , a lack of education was observed in practice in community - based health insurance .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the authors found that people mostly hold back from taking preventive and measure son time on reporting as few first reported cases in any disease outbreak .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	when they can see more danger , they might become more careful .

9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	( mch ) systems are progressing because the government has formed different partnerships and associations at different levels [ 17 ] .in
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	countries other than china , secrecy and trust were found to be hindrances to the use of social media [ 18 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	some countries do not allow people to post health information on social media without authentic reports [ 19 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	online communal support is also affected by online communication of health professionals with patients [ 20 ] and the use of online technology for societal help [ 15 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	we can not ignore that fear , gossip , and rumors are spread online by some medical experts [ 21 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the above literature shows the role of social media in spreading information , although a small number of rumors may also be spread through society .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	loyalty and devotion to one 's country is emotive behavior , especially in republic countries [ 22 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the chinese nation is one of most patriotic nations in the world .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	our study area , wuhan , is considered the chicago of china due to its heavy road traffic , and the population of wuhan is more than 11 million [ 23 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	anhui province is next to wuhan , containing the second city reporting patients with covid-19 , after wuhan .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	computers do not have a direct impact on physical health activities but play an intellectual role in online social awareness .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	the reliability of messages and information along with the trustworthiness of websites are important with regards to health [ 24 ] .
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	however , users ' views about their health conditions were the same after using an app as before using the app [ 25 ] .

2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	hpev3 lacks this motif and the receptors remain unknown .
2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	hpevs can be detected in patient nasopharyngeal and stool samples , and infection is presumed to occur after respiratory or gastro - intestinal transmission .
2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	hpev pathogenesis is poorly understood as there are no animal models and previous studies have been conducted in immortalized monolayer cell cultures which do not adequately represent the characteristics of human tissues .
2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	to bridge this gap , we determined the polarity of infection , replication kinetics , and cell tropism of hpev1 and hpev3 in the well - differentiated human airway epithelial ( hae ) model .
2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	we found the hae cultures to be permissive for hpevs .
2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	both hpev genotypes infected the hae preferentially from the basolateral surface while the progeny virus was shed toward the apical side .
2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	confocal microscopy revealed the target cell type to be the p63 + basal cells for both viruses , αv itg and hs blocking had no effect on the replication of either virus , and transcriptional profiling suggested that hpev3 infection induced stronger immune activation than hpev1 .
2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	genotype - specific host responses may contribute to the differences in pathogenesis and clinical outcomes associated with hpev1 and hpev3 .

d6d7306eb3f303f7461ab6cab965ef0c5d179719	it requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures , highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes .
d6d7306eb3f303f7461ab6cab965ef0c5d179719	methodological approaches that range from purely physics - based diffusion models to data - driven environmental methods rely on agentbased modeling to accommodate context - dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process .
d6d7306eb3f303f7461ab6cab965ef0c5d179719	mixing agent - based modeling with data - driven machine learning has become popularity .
d6d7306eb3f303f7461ab6cab965ef0c5d179719	however , little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions , whether used in an individual or a collective process .

2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	testing is an important part of tackling the covid-19 pandemic .
2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	availability of testing is a bottleneck due to constrained resources and effective prioritization of individuals is necessary .
2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	here , we discuss the impact of different prioritization policies on covid-19 patient discovery and the ability of governments and health organizations to use the results for effective decision making .
2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	we suggest a framework for testing that balances maximal discovery of positive individuals with the need for population - based surveillance aimed at understanding disease spread and characteristics .
2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	this framework draws from similar approaches to prioritization in the domain of cyber - security based on ranking individuals using a risk score and then reserving a portion of the capacity for random sampling .
2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	this approach is an application of multi - armed - bandits maximizing exploration / exploitation of the underlying distribution .
2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	we find that individuals can be ranked for effective testing using a few simple features , and that ranking them using such models we can capture 65 % ( ci : 64.7%-68.3 % ) of the positive individuals using less than 20 % of the testing capacity or 92.1 % ( ci : 91.1%-93.2 % ) of positives individuals using 70 % of the capacity , allowing reserving a significant portion of the tests for population studies .
2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	our approach allows experts and decision makers to tailor the resulting policies as needed allowing transparency into the ranking policy and the ability to understand the disease spread in the population and react quickly and in an informed manner .

a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) and novel variants of influenza a virus , such as h5n1 and pandemic h1n1 .

a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra - alveolar fibrosis in sars and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in h5n1 influenza .
a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	secondly , the pathology and pathogenesis of sars and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared .

741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	this review presents some current thoughts regarding the epizootiology of the feline coronaviruses ; feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) and feline coronavirus ( fecv ) , with primary emphasis on the pathogenesis of these viruses in nature .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	although the mechanism ( s ) whereby fipv causes disease are still incompletely understood , there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of fipv and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	the first involves the hypothesis , originally promulgated by pedersen in 1981 , that fipv is derived from fecv during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	the second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance , which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systemic immunity .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	in the case of fipv infection , we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	once oral tolerance is disrupted , fipv is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune - mediated vasculitis and death .
741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674	thus , it may be that clinical forms of fip are due to a combination of two events , the first being the generation of fipv from fecv , and the second being the capacity of fipv to circumvent oral tolerance .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	the covid-19 pandemic has provided many challenges in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	among these is a novel form of coagulopathy that includes exceptionally high levels of d - dimer .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	d - dimer is a marker of poor prognosis , but does this also imply a causal relationship ?
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	these spectacularly raised ddimer levels may actually signify the failing attempt of the fibrinolytic system to remove fibrin and necrotic tissue from the lung parenchyma , being consumed or overwhelmed in the process .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	indeed , recent studies suggest that increasing fibrinolytic activity might offer hope for patients with critical disease and severe respiratory failure .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	however , the fibrinolytic system can also be harnessed by coronavirus to promote infectivity and where anti - fibrinolytic measures would also seem appropriate .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	hence , there is a clinical paradox where plasmin formation can be either deleterious or beneficial in covid-19 , but not at the same time .
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	hence , it all comes down to timing .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	the key precursors for p - hydroxybenzoate production by engineered pseudomonas putida s12 are phosphoenolpyruvate ( pep ) and erythrose-4-phosphate ( e4p ) , for which the pentose phosphate ( pp ) pathway is an important source .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	since pp pathway fluxes are typically low in pseudomonads , e4p and pep availability is a likely bottleneck for aromatics production which may be alleviated by stimulating pp pathway fluxes via co - feeding of pentoses in addition to glucose or glycerol .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	as p. putida s12 lacks the natural ability to utilize xylose , the xylose isomerase pathway from e. coli was introduced into the p - hydroxybenzoate producing strain p. putida s12palb2 .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	the initially inefficient xylose utilization was improved by evolutionary selection after which the p - hydroxybenzoate production was evaluated .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	even without xylose - co - feeding , p - hydroxybenzoate production was improved in the evolved xyloseutilizing strain , which may indicate an intrinsically elevated pp pathway activity .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	xylose co - feeding further improved the p - hydroxybenzoate yield when co - fed with either glucose or glycerol , up to 16.3 cmol% ( 0.1 g p - hydroxybenzoate / g substrate ) .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	the yield improvements were most pronounced with glycerol , which probably related to the availability of the pep precursor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ( gap ) .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	thus , it was demonstrated that the production of aromatics such as p - hydroxybenzoate can be improved by co - feeding different carbon sources via different and partially artificial pathways .
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	moreover , this approach opens new perspectives for the efficient production of ( fine ) chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulose that typically has a high content of both glucose and xylose and ( crude ) glycerol .

cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	groups 1 , 2 and 3 , twice a day , were administered chitosan oligosaccharide at a dose of 100 , 500 , and 1000 mg / kg for 7 days , respectively , with milk replacer .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	in group 4 , lambs with cryptosporidiosis were subjected to normal feeding as control without drug administration .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	clinical examinations of lambs were made before treatment ( day 0 ) and on days 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 after treatment and 5 ml of blood was collected from vena jugularis for blood analysis of all lambs .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	weight changes of lambs were recorded at 0 , 7 , 14 , and 21 days .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	stool specimens were collected pre - treatment ( day 0 ) and on days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 and 21 post - treatment to determine oocyst excretion of lambs with cryptosporidiosis .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	lambs with a mean oocyte counts > 10 after stool examination were included to the treatment .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	changes in clinical hematology , blood gases and biochemical parameters were observed during the course of treatment , but these changes were limited .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	weight loss was observed at 7th day according to 0th day the lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis but gradually weight increase was observed at 14th and 21st days and these changes were similar in all groups .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	oocyst excretion decreased in all groups during treatment .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	according to 0th day , there was a significant ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in oocyte excretions in the third day in group 1 and 2 , and in day 5 in the group 3 and 4 .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	significant changes ( p < 0.05 ) were observed in oocyst excretions on the third and fifth days among the groups .
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	as a result , in lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis , chitosan oligosaccharide improved in clinical signs and stool character shorter than the positive control group and the administration of chitosan oligosaccharide at doses of 100 , 500 and 1000 mg / kg for 7 days significantly reduced oocyst excretion but not enough to remove cryptosporidiosis completely .

e690c113c207f132b7b68a38f53889109e65a166	hr2p - m2 was highly effective in inhibiting mers - cov s protein - mediated cell - cell fusion and infection by pseudoviruses expressing mers - cov s protein with or without mutation in the hr1 region .
e690c113c207f132b7b68a38f53889109e65a166	it interacted with the hr1 peptide to form stable α - helical complex and blocked six - helix bundle formation between the hr1 and hr2 domains in the viral s protein .

059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	the pangolin is unique in that it is one of the world 's most endangered and widely trafficked animals 16 - 21 , yet we know little about its behaviour or ecology 17 , 22 , [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	the limited scientific data on pangolins are concerning considering that all eight species are threatened with extinction 16 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	the primary threats to conserving wild pangolins are unsustainable levels of poaching for traditional medicine and bushmeat , and habitat loss [ 25 ] [ 26 ]
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	[ 27 ] [ 28 ] .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	much of the literature on pangolins details the degree to which the illegal wildlife trade continues to drastically affect their population numbers 17 - 21 , with limited investigation thus far of how pangolins behave in their natural environments 17 , 22 , [ 24 ] [ 25 ]
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	[ 26 ] 29 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	conservation concern for pangolins is further complicated by the difficulty of studying them in the wild 17,25,29 - 31 , as their reduced numbers provide fewer sampling opportunities and our lack of understanding regarding their ecology impairs our ability to locate those that remain .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	opportunities to study and conserve pangolins ex - situ are also rare , given that there is a particularly high mortality rate associated with maintaining them in captivity 17,31 - 37 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	pangolins often die in captivity as a result of improper diets 17 , 35 , 38 , 40 and the difficulty of rehabilitating them after they have been exposed to the physical traumas of illegal poaching and smuggling 32,39 - 42 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	given the challenges of studying pangolins both in captivity and the wild , any opportunity to study their behaviour could have a significant , positive impact on both captive welfare and wild conservation efforts .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	pangolins are unique mammals with dorsal scaling , no teeth , prehensile tails , and a long tongue that protrudes during foraging 24 , 43 , 44 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	although there are eight species with distinct characteristics within the pangolin taxon , most are primarily nocturnal 24,44 , and prey on ants and termites 22 , 23 , 38 , 44 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	research on pangolin sensory perception is remarkably lacking .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	studies on the brain anatomy of african tree pangolins ( phataginus tricuspis , formerly manis tricuspis ) suggest they have enlarged olfactory bulbs relative to other mammals , but non - remarkable visual and auditory systems 28,45 - 47 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	behavioural anecdotes of pangolins using their elongated snouts and tongues to forage seem to support the idea that they rely on olfaction and somatosensory information to find food 24 , 36 , 45 , 46 , 48 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	although pangolin vision is considered relatively poor 24,36,49 , recent research on the anatomy of the pangolin eye suggests it may be well - adapted for the nocturnal environment 50 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	research on pangolin audition is particularly sparse , with mixed reports on the quality of their hearing 24,36 , and no direct evidence of how they might integrate acoustic information into their general behavioural ecology 47 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	the current study specifically investigates the foraging behaviour of the semi - arboreal sunda pangolin ( manis javanica ) 24,26,33 , one of the most threatened mammals on the planet 51 .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	here , we use several experimental paradigms to investigate the pangolin 's use of vision , hearing , and smell to locate food .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	in phase i of this study , we tested the pangolin 's ability to locate food in a two object - choice task by controlling for two of these three sensory modalities and allowing the animal to investigate and choose , using the remaining sensory information , which one of two containers held food .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	in other words , we blocked two types of sensory information coming from the food source and thus from being perceived by the pangolin in order to assess whether it was able to use the remaining information alone to find the food .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	in phase ii , we developed two novel olfaction tasks to investigate whether or not the pangolin was using distant or proximal prey odors to find food .
059ecd7ef65ca02e5bb9a0359009f033141843d9	although there is little known about how pangolins locate food in their environments , our own observations of the pangolin 's use of its pronounced snout led us to predict that olfaction would be their dominant sensory modality when foraging .

b7ce3b625fefee03c2f2d5d7728b4b6ab0abbfd1	designing side chain substituents complementary to enzyme binding pockets is of great importance in the construction of potent and selective phosphinic dipeptide inhibitors of metallo - aminopeptidases .
b7ce3b625fefee03c2f2d5d7728b4b6ab0abbfd1	proper structure selection makes inhibitor construction more economic , as the development process typically consists of multiple iterative preparation / bioassay steps .
b7ce3b625fefee03c2f2d5d7728b4b6ab0abbfd1	on the basis of these principles , using noncomplex computation and modeling methodologies , we comprehensively screened 900 commercial precursors of the p1 residues of phosphinic dipeptide and dehydrodipeptide analogs to identify the most promising ligands of 52 metallo - dependent aminopeptidases with known crystal structures .
b7ce3b625fefee03c2f2d5d7728b4b6ab0abbfd1	the results revealed several nonproteinogenic residues with an improved energy of binding compared with the best known inhibitors .

b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) encodes a papain - like protease ( plpro ) with both deubiquitinating ( dub ) and deisgylating activities that are proposed to counteract the post - translational modification of signaling molecules that activate the innate immune response .

b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700	we present the x - ray crystal structure of plpro in complex with ubiquitin - aldehyde and model the interaction of plpro with other ubiquitin - chain and isg15 substrates .
b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700	we show that plpro greatly prefers k48-to k63-linked ubiquitin chains , and isg15-based substrates to those that are mono - ubiquitinated .
b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700	we propose that plpro 's higher affinity for k48-linked ubiquitin chains and isg15 stems from a bivalent mechanism of binding , where two ubiquitin - like domains prefer to bind in the palm domain of plpro with the most distal ubiquitin domain interacting with a ' ' ridge ' ' region of the thumb domain .
b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700	mutagenesis of residues within this ridge region revealed that these mutants retain viral protease activity and the ability to catalyze hydrolysis of mono - ubiquitin .
b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700	however , a select number of these mutants have a significantly reduced ability to hydrolyze the substrate isg15-amc , or be inhibited by k48linked diubuiquitin .
b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700	for these latter residues , we found that plpro antagonism of the nuclear factor kappa - light - chainenhancer of activated b - cells ( nfkb ) signaling pathway is abrogated .
b7b6bf20c919a0b200c528e76f76f508d5554700	this identification of key and unique sites in plpro required for recognition and processing of diubiquitin and isg15 versus mono - ubiquitin and protease activity provides new insight into ubiquitin - chain and isg15 recognition and highlights a role for plpro dub and deisgylase activity in antagonism of the innate immune response .

1de0921aa7e5225250ff9f569b770c52ae1cb593	from 28 young children in the netherlands , we isolated a paramyxovirus that was identified as a tentative new member of the metapneumovirus genus based on virological data , sequence homology and gene constellation .
1de0921aa7e5225250ff9f569b770c52ae1cb593	previously , avian pneumovirus was the sole member of this recently assigned genus , hence the provisional name for the newly discovered virus : human metapneumovirus .
1de0921aa7e5225250ff9f569b770c52ae1cb593	the clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus infection , ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia .
1de0921aa7e5225250ff9f569b770c52ae1cb593	serological studies showed that by the age of five years , virtually all children in the netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years .

ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	we obtained a 71 % cr , 49 patients were in ccr and eligible to a second consolidation ; 21 of these ( 43 % ) obtained a successful cd34 mobilization and underwent autologous transplant .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	six patients had a hct - ci 0 score , 11 had a score between 1 and 2 , 4 patients had a > 3 score .

ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	surprisingly no patients with a > 3 hct - ci score died , vs. one patient in the 1 - 2 score group ( 9 % ) and 4 patients in the 0 score group ( 67 % )
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	( p = 0.02 ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	age < and > 70 years did not affect the trm rate , but all the fi ve deaths occurred after the administration of busulfan plus melfalan ( bumel ) with an higher trm rate in this group ( 42 % , p = 0.04 ) in comparison with the patients receiving beam .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	in our small series all 6 patients with a 0 hct - ci score received bumel as conditioning ( p = 0.01 ) , suggesting that the higher trm rate in this group might be related to the administration of a more toxic conditioning regimen .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	elderly patients generally have several comorbidities and hct - ci score might be an insuffi cient tool in assessing their frailty .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	the high trm rate in elderly aml patients suggests that some of these patients should receive less toxic conditioning or alternative consolidation regimen .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	larger retrospective and multicentric studies are therefore needed in order to better validate this score in this setting .

ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	we performed a retrospective study at our center to investigate its capacity in predicting the outcome in comparison with well defi ned disease - specifi c risk factors .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	methods :
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	we reviewed the records of 340 patients with aml who underwent allogeneic hct at our institution between january 2000 and december 2008 .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	pretransplant comorbidities were assessed by review of medical charts and computer database system .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	for each patient we assessed the karnofsky performance score and calculated the hct - ci as defi ned by sorror et al .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	( 2005 ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	cox regression modeling was applied for the endpoint overall survival ( os ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	non - relapse mortality ( nrm ) was analysed using univariate and multivariate competing events statistics .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	results :
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	the median age at hct was 53 years ( range , 11 to 76 ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	133 patients had received myeloablative and 207 nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	donors were matched siblings in 116 and alternative donors in 224 patients .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	twenty - fi ve percent patients were in fi rst complete remission of standard risk aml .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	hct - ci risk was low in 6 % , intermediate in 20 % , and high in 74 % of the patients .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	overall survival at 3 years was 29 % , 40 % , and 44 % ( p = 0.7 ) and nrm was 34 % , 32 % , and 26 % ( p = 0.6 ) , in the low , intermediate and high - risk hct - ci groups , respectively .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	in multivariate analysis , the hct - ci failed to predict os and nrm .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	a reason for this could be , that patients with low comorbidity scores were very rare in this cohort .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	in part this was due to the high incidence of " heart valve disease " in our cohort , defi ned in the hct - ci as any kind of valvular disease except for mitral valve prolapse .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	heart valve disease qualifi es on its own for a high hct - ci score .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	in the original publication by sorror the incidence was 2 % .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	prior to hct 45 % of our patients had mostly trace to mild valvular regurgitation , and thus had a high hct - ci score .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	this compares to an incidence of 35 % valvular regurgitation in the healthy population ( framingham heart study ) and may therefore not be overestimated .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	ambiguous defi nitions could therefore limit the applicability of the hct - ci .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	conclusion :
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	in conclusion , in high risk aml patients the hct - ci was not associated with nrm or os in a cohort of predominantly high risk aml patients .

ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	the prognosis of refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) remains dismal .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	salvage therapy including gemtuzumab ozogamicin ( go ) can induce remission , but allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo - sct ) is the only curative option for this cohort of patients .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	however , factors predicting the response to go treatment , especially for patients with complex karyotype , have not yet been defi ned .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	here , we present the correlation between response to go therapy and the presence or absence of hla - dr15 antigen in a cohort of refractory or relapsed aml patients treated at hannover medical school prior to allo - sct .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	methods :
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	we retrospectively evaluated patients with refractory or relapsed aml treated with go prior to allo - sct at our center from 2002 until 2009 .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	patients were divided into two groups : patients who responded to go
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	( r group ; cr , pr , aplasia ) and patients who remained refractory ( nr group ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	results :
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	26 patients were evaluable for go response , and 24 patients have proceeded to allo - sct so far .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	both groups were comparable for sex , age , indication for go ( induction failure vs. relapse ) , patients with de novo aml vs. saml/ t - aml and high - risk cytogenetics .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	indications for go included induction failure ( n = 14 , 54 % ) and relapse ( n = 12 , 46 % ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	thirteen patients ( 50 % ) responded to go treatment .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	nine ( 69 % ) of these were hla - dr15 positive compared to 1 ( 8 % ) in the nr group ( p < 0.01 ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	remarkably , the cumulative dose of go was higher in the nr group ( 8 mg / m 2 ) compared to the r group ( 5 mg / m 2 ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	more patients in the r group received a combination of chemotherapy with go than in the nr group ( 54 % vs. 15 % , p = 0.1 ) .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	also , patients in the nr group had a median of 2 prior salvage therapies vs. one median salvage course in the r group .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ( sos ) is a major complication in patients receiving go : 6 of the 24 patients ( 25 % ) of the transplant cohort developed sos , 3 in each group .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	three out of these 6 patients had a myeloablative conditioning regimen with busulfan .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	the remaining sct patients received different reduced intensity conditioning regimens ( 67 % flamsa / tbi ) without busulfan .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	conclusion :
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	to the best of our knowledge , this is the fi rst report of an association of go treatment and hla - dr 15 antigen positivity .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	if these results were confi rmed in larger studies , hla - dr 15 could become a marker for go response .
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	such information is of special interest for developing salvage therapies for highrisk patients .

45fbf18ee16592ac7aea4f4b7bca4ad682e5d818	a viral etiology is possible , because most demyelinating diseases of known etiology in both man and animals are viral .
45fbf18ee16592ac7aea4f4b7bca4ad682e5d818	in most cases demyelination is to a limited extent the result of direct virus destruction of oligodendrocytes , but for the most part is the consequence of immune and inflammatory responses .

cb6e922636d0d3d414a7ab7b2b6d53146a0ec7d9	despite the availability of effective chemotherapy , the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis ( tb ) and of tb - related critical illness has increased dramatically over the last few decades [ 1 , 2 ] .
cb6e922636d0d3d414a7ab7b2b6d53146a0ec7d9	moreover , mortality rates remain high in patients with active severe pulmonary tb requiring mechanical ventilation [ 3 ] .
cb6e922636d0d3d414a7ab7b2b6d53146a0ec7d9	delays in diagnosis and treatment have been recognized as causes of death due to pulmonary tb , and several studies have sought to reduce these delays by identifying factors that should lead to a high index of suspicion [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] .
cb6e922636d0d3d414a7ab7b2b6d53146a0ec7d9	reasons for missing the diagnosis of tb have included failure to perform appropriate diagnostic investigations and misinterpretation of the radiologic or clinical manifestations of tb as indicating a malignancy , pneumonia or other conditions [ 8 , 9 , 10 ] .
cb6e922636d0d3d414a7ab7b2b6d53146a0ec7d9	many case reports of acute respiratory failure associated with pulmonary tb have been published [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] .

ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	coughing plays an important role in influenza transmission ; however , there is insufficient information regarding the viral load in cough because of the lack of convenient and reliable collection methods .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	we developed a portable airborne particlecollection system to measure the viral load ; it is equipped with an air sampler to draw air and pass it through a gelatin membrane filter connected to a cone - shaped , megaphone - like device to guide the cough airflow to the membrane .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	the membrane was dissolved in a medium , and the viral load was measured using quantitative real - time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	the approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10 % in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	using this system , cough samples were collected from 56 influenza a patients .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	the total viral detection rate was 41 % ( 23/56 ) , and the viral loads varied significantly ( from , 10 , less than the detection limit , to 2240 viral gene copies / cough ) .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with # 18 plaque forming units per cough sample .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	the virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment , viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	we found cases with high viral titers in throat swabs or oral secretions but very low or undetectable in coughs and vice versa suggesting other possible anatomical sites where the viruses might be mixed into the cough .
ed02cdbaaf52f191ad3bebb5a3bc117524718c8e	our system is easy to operate , appropriate for bedside use , and is useful for comparing the viral load in cough samples from influenza patients under various conditions and settings .

936e6e20342454e2646bd840d70148c893262146	over the past two decades there has been an increase in total number of cchf case reports , including imported cchf patients , and an expansion of cchf endemic areas .
936e6e20342454e2646bd840d70148c893262146	despite its increased public health burden there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments to prevent cchf .

a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	as the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of china , public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports .
a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	we evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-ncov infection .
a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	in our baseline scenario , we estimated that 46.5 % ( 95%ci : 35.9 to 57.7 ) of infected travellers would not be detected , depending on the incubation period , sensitivity of exit and entry screening , and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic .
a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-ncov infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers .
a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	we developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available .

a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	there were cases in at least 15 other countries , identified due to symptoms plus recent travel history to hubei province , china , which strongly suggests that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the actual number of infected individuals in china 2 .
a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	while the most affected region , hubei province , has now ceased air travel and closed major public transport routes 3
a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	it is unlikely that these measures will fully contain the outbreak .
a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	despite limited evidence for its effectiveness 4,5 , airport screening is frequently implemented to limit the probability of infected cases entering other regions or countries .
a01672035e0b9d21f9a934b9c9071610513325f2	here we use the available evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for detecting travellers with 2019-ncov.

2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	in particular , a new superfamily of widespread , small positive - strand rna viruses was delineated that unites tombus - like and noda - like viruses .
2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	comparison of the genome architectures of rna viruses discovered by metagenomics and by traditional methods reveals an extent of gene module shuffling among diverse virus genomes that far exceeds the previous appreciation of this evolutionary phenomenon .
2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	most dramatically , inclusion of the metagenomic data in phylogenetic analyses of the rdrp resulted in the identification of numerous , strongly supported groups that encompass rna viruses from diverse hosts including different groups of protists , animals and plants .
2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	notwithstanding potential caveats , in particular , incomplete and uneven sampling of eukaryotic taxa , these highly unexpected findings reveal horizontal virus transfer ( hvt ) between diverse hosts as the central aspect of rna virus evolution .
2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	the vast and diverse virome of invertebrates , particularly nematodes and arthropods , appears to be the reservoir , from which the viromes of plants and vertebrates evolved via multiple hvt events .
0c82f2e6fc8bc8f4d9ce44ddb87f19dd3664db55	by the end of march , 2020 , there were more than 180,000 confirmed cases in the us , distributed across more than 2000 counties .
0c82f2e6fc8bc8f4d9ce44ddb87f19dd3664db55	we find that the right tail of this distribution exhibits a power law , with pareto exponent close to one .
0c82f2e6fc8bc8f4d9ce44ddb87f19dd3664db55	we investigate whether a simple model of the growth of covid-19 cases involving gibrat 's law can explain the emergence of this power law .
0c82f2e6fc8bc8f4d9ce44ddb87f19dd3664db55	the model is calibrated to match ( i ) the growth rates of confirmed cases , and ( ii ) the varying lengths of time during which covid-19 had been present within each county .
0c82f2e6fc8bc8f4d9ce44ddb87f19dd3664db55	thus calibrated , the model generates a power law with pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of march .
8a94d5604fa458cdcfee691b097a4b226262c6e2	the objective of this study was to determine the burden of depressed mood and anxiety in covid-19 , and associated disease characteristics .
8a94d5604fa458cdcfee691b097a4b226262c6e2	this is a prospective , cross - sectional study of 114 covid-19 positive patients diagnosed using rt - pcr - based testing over a 6-week period .

8a94d5604fa458cdcfee691b097a4b226262c6e2	loss of taste also exhibited similar associations with phq-2 and gad-2 .
8a94d5604fa458cdcfee691b097a4b226262c6e2	phq-2 and
8a94d5604fa458cdcfee691b097a4b226262c6e2	gad-2 scores were not associated with severities of any other symptoms during the covid-19 course .

2f70fc601b4d40ff368df47cf606721f7212c635	human longevity is a complex phenotype with a strong genetic predisposition .
2f70fc601b4d40ff368df47cf606721f7212c635	increasing evidence has revealed the genetic antecedents of human longevity .
2f70fc601b4d40ff368df47cf606721f7212c635	this article aims to review the data of various case / control association studies that examine the difference in genetic polymorphisms between long - lived people and younger subjects across different human populations .
2f70fc601b4d40ff368df47cf606721f7212c635	there are more than 100 candidate genes potentially involved in human longevity ; this article particularly focuses on genes of the insulin / igf-1 pathway , foxo3a , foxo1a , lipoprotein metabolism
2f70fc601b4d40ff368df47cf606721f7212c635	( e.g. , apoe and pon1 ) , and cell - cycle regulators ( e.g. , tp53 and p21 ) .
2f70fc601b4d40ff368df47cf606721f7212c635	since the confirmed genetic components for human longevity are few to date , further precise assessment of the genetic contributions is required .
2f70fc601b4d40ff368df47cf606721f7212c635	gaining a better understanding of the contribution of genetics to human longevity may assist in the design of improved treatment methods for age - related diseases , delay the aging process , and , ultimately , prolong the human lifespan .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	the rapid spread of the covid-19 demands immediate response from the scientific communities .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets ( epitopes ) .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	there are several articles that discuss such choices in the sars - cov-2 proteome , other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the coronaviridae genome / proteome .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	however none consider viral protein low complexity regions ( lcrs ) .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	we show that five low complexity regions ( lcrs ) in three proteins ( nsp3 , s and n ) encoded by the sars - cov-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	as many as 21 predicted t - cell epitopes and 27 predicted b - cell epitopes overlap with the five sars - cov-2 lcrs similar to human 1 proteins .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	interestingly , replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral rna are devoid of lcrs .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	similarity of sars - cov-2 lcrs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	the vaccine targeted lcrs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	these findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	the outbreak of the covid-19 disease affects humans all over the globe .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	more and more people get sick and many die because of the deadly sars - cov-2 virus .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	the whole machinery of this pathogen is enclosed in a short sequence of nucleotides , building blocks for both rna and dna strands .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	this rna virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids ( building bricks ) that are usually used quite freely by proteins .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	however , there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	we name those low complexity regions ( lcrs ) .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	we invented the first programmes able to compare such lcrs .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	this discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	it means that companies should not use these very lcrs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease .
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	on the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	the spike ( s ) gene of the attenuated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv )
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	dr13 was cloned and sequenced to further explore the functions of wild type pedv and attenuated pedv .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	sequencing revealed a single large orf of 4,149 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1,382 amino acids with predicted m r of 151 kda .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	the coding region of the s gene of attenuated pedv dr13 had 20 nucleotide changes that appeared to be significant determinants of function in that they produced changes in its predicted amino acid sequence .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	notably , attenuated pedv dr13 has previously been found to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in pigs .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	the regions containing these 20 nucleotide changes may therefore be crucial for pedv pathogenicity .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	the attenuated pedv dr13 s protein contains 28 asn - xaa - ser / thr sequons , 21 asparagines that are predicted to be n - glycosylated and a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues at positions 1,327 - 1,347 , which is predicted to form an a - helix and to function as a membrane anchor .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	one ( from n to k at 378 ) of the changes in the deduced amino acid sequence destroyed n - linked glycosylation sites , while another change ( from n to s at 114 ) created a new one at a different location .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	these alterations in n - linked glycosylation sites reflected 3 nucleotide changes , which were related to the abovementioned nucleotide changes and are suggested to influence the pathogenicity of attenuated pedv dr13 .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	attenuated pedv dr13 has 96.5 , 96.4 , 96.1 , 93.9 , 93.5 and 96.6 % dna sequence identities with cv777 , br1/87 , js-2004 - 2 , spk1 , chinju99 and parent dr13 , respectively .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	likewise , it shares 95.7 , 95.4 , 95.6 , 92.0 , 91.6 and 95.7 % identity with those genes at the deduced amino acid sequence level .
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	phylogenetic analysis suggested that attenuated pedv dr13 is closely related to cv777 , br1/87 , js-2004 - 2 and parent dr13 , rather than to spk1 and chinju99 and is especially close to the chinese pedv strain js-2004 - 2 .

15a0a1f83c9f096d245ed2c77d96f3bdf0a2f95a	while the hypothesis that dromedary camels are the likely major source of mers - cov infection in humans is gaining acceptance , conjecture continues over the original natural reservoir host(s )
15a0a1f83c9f096d245ed2c77d96f3bdf0a2f95a	and specifically the role of bats in the emergence of the virus .
15a0a1f83c9f096d245ed2c77d96f3bdf0a2f95a	dromedary camels were imported to australia , principally between 1880 and 1907 and have since become a large feral population inhabiting extensive parts of the continent .
15a0a1f83c9f096d245ed2c77d96f3bdf0a2f95a	here we report that during a focussed surveillance study , no serological evidence was found for the presence of mers - cov in the camels in the australian population .
15a0a1f83c9f096d245ed2c77d96f3bdf0a2f95a	this finding presents various hypotheses about the timing of the emergence and spread of mers - cov throughout populations of camels in africa and asia , which can be partially resolved by testing sera from camels from the original source region , which we have inferred was mainly northwestern pakistan .
15a0a1f83c9f096d245ed2c77d96f3bdf0a2f95a	in addition , we identify bat species which overlap ( or neighbour )

cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	background :
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	bubonic plague is the primary manifestation of infection with yersinia pestis , accounting for 90 % of all plague cases and with 75 % of global cases reported in madagascar .
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	all drugs in use for treating plague are registered based on experimental data and anecdotal evidence , and no regimen currently recommended is supported by a randomized clinical trial .
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	the imasoy trial intends to fill this knowledge gap by comparing two 10-day regimens included in the national guidelines in madagascar .
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	the primary objective of the trial is to test the hypothesis that ciprofloxacin monotherapy is non - inferior to streptomycin followed by ciprofloxacin for the treatment of bubonic plague , thus avoiding the need for injectable , potentially toxic , aminoglycosides .
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	methods :
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	a two - arm parallel - group randomized control trial will be conducted across peripheral health centres in madagascar in five districts .
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	males and non - pregnant females of all ages with suspected bubonic or pneumonic plague will be recruited over the course of three plague ' seasons ' .
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	the primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the proportion of patients with bubonic plague who have a therapeutic response to treatment ( defined as alive , resolution of fever , 25 % reduction in the size of measurable buboes , has not received an alternative treatment and no clinical decision to continue antibiotics ) as assessed on day 11 .
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	discussion :
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	if successful , the trial has the potential to inform the standard of care guidelines not just in madagascar but in other countries afflicted by plague .
cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	the trial is currently ongoing and expected to complete recruitment in 2022 .
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	in response to covid-19 , seed security interventions are being planned to help bolster fragile livelihoods .
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	after 25 years of research during emergencies , there are many lessons to build on , including that seed systems , especially informal markets , prove fairly resilient and often function even in high stress contexts .
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	as a wise first step , given the possible volatility in supply , farmers ' seed saving should be supported actively and at scale .
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	rigorous remote assessments will have to become the new norm for gauging seed security , with reviews recognizing that different crops might be affected in different ways by specific seed channel stress or breakdown .
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	well - known short - term seed security responses , for example , direct seed distribution , will need to be tailored to the new covid-19 reality , particularly in terms of altering logistics .
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	more fundamentally , three new factors might herald a transformation in response : 1 ) choice for farmers has to be the operative principle ( especially as markets may fluctuate quickly ) ; 2 ) remote two - way ' state of the art ' communication has to be built rapidly ; and 3 )
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	seed quality options might need to be liberalized , especially given the scale of possible seed security intervention .
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	covid-19 effects will likely linger several years or potentially six to nine seasons ( depending on agricultural calendar ) .
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	now might be the time to move from stop - gap responses ( and repetitive ones ) to more sustainable and powerful market - led support , with particular emphasis on responses that leverage and strengthen the informal sector markets .
3ef316cced2d887ad6063cc0dd01ec890849ce07	we found tha : rats subjected to thermal skin injury ( bum ) had increased serum hydrogen peroxide ( h202 )

3ef316cced2d887ad6063cc0dd01ec890849ce07	when compared to sham - treated rats .
3ef316cced2d887ad6063cc0dd01ec890849ce07	serum h202 scavenging activity was inhibited by addition of sodium azide , a catalase inhibitor .
3ef316cced2d887ad6063cc0dd01ec890849ce07	treatment of rats with the oxygen radical scavenger , dimethylthiourea ( dmtu ) , decreased rbc fragility and lung leak but did not alter increased h2oz scavenging or catalase activity of serum from rats subjected to skin bum .
3ef316cced2d887ad6063cc0dd01ec890849ce07	we conclude that increased serum catalase activity is a consequence of thermal skin injury and that increased serum catalase activity may be a mechanism that modulates hzo2-dependent processes following skin bum .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	biomedical applications increasingly require fully characterized new nanomaterials .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	there is strong evidence showing that nanomaterials not only interact with cells passively but also actively , mediating essential molecular processes for the regulation of cellular functions , but we are only starting to understand the mechanisms of those interactions .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	systematic studies about cell behavior as a response to specific nanoparticle properties are scarce in the literature even when they are necessary for the rational design of medical nanodevices .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	information in the literature shows that the physicochemical properties determine the bioactivity , biocompatibility , and safety of nanomaterials .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	the information available regarding the interaction and responses of cells to nanomaterials has not been analyzed and discussed in a single document .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	hence , in this review , we present the latest advances about cellular responses to nanomaterials and integrate the available information into concrete considerations for the development of innovative , efficient , specific and , more importantly , safe biomedical nanodevices .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	we focus on how physicochemical nanoparticle properties ( size , chemical surface , shape , charge , and topography ) influence cell behavior in a first attempt to provide a practical guide for designing medical nanodevices , avoiding common experimental omissions that may lead to data misinterpretation .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	finally , we emphasize the importance of the systematic study of nano - bio interactions to acquire sufficient reproducible information that allows accurate control of cell behavior based on tuning of nanomaterial properties .
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	this information is useful to guide the design of specific nanodevices and nanomaterials to elicit desired cell responses , like targeting , drug delivery , cell attachment , differentiation , etc , or to avoid undesired side effects .

4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	in this projection exercise , we analyzed the circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic in bangladesh and used multiple methods to characterize the epidemic curve .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	we merged several publicly available data sets for the purpose .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	projections using actual government data as of june 16 , 2020 reveals that the epidemic curve for bangladesh may be different from that of developed countries and quite similar to such curves in countries in the region .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	this is true , both in terms of incidence of cases ( total number of cases per million population ) and length of the epidemic ( months to peak or flatten the epidemic curve ) .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	we find that while bangladesh went into lockdown early , efforts to maintain lockdown at a national level was relaxed and new cases accelerated ; with significant growth happening since lifting of lockdown on may 31 .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	our estimates indicate prevalence of covid-19 may be between 200,000 and 600,000 towards end of the year , may take 9 months ( 270 days ) to flatten the epidemic curve , lifting of the lockdown may have increased total cases by 60 to 100 % and may have prolonged the epidemic by additional 2 - 3 months .

4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	most infected with covid-19 do not show any symptoms and those that do have fever , cough , fatigue , slight dyspnoea , sore throat , headache and conjunctivitis ( 4 ) .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	the course of the infection is mild for most infected ; thus 80 - 90 % recover without any serious impacts ; however , about 10 % may have trouble breathing and low blood oxygen level and require hospitalization .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	a further 5 % may experience life threatening condition such as respiratory failure and multiorgan failure .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	thus , case fatality rate , defined as percentage of infected patients who may die , for covid-19 range from 2 - 5 % and this percentage increases with age and for those with chronic comorbid conditions such as diabetes , asthma and heart disease .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	thus spread of covid-19 in bangladesh poses a significant threat ; and without active intervention by government , even if a small percentage of the population , say 5 % , are infected , this translates to 8,000,000 needing hospitalization and over 200,000 deaths .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	observing the spread and potential significant health effects , many researchers estimated potential impact of covid-19 pandemic to help policy makers prepare respective countries and their systems to face this pandemic .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	the main thrust of these estimations has been to encourage policy makers to implement strong non - pharmaceutical intervention ( npi ) such as social distancing , hand hygiene and wearing of face masks , self quarantining , all to reduce the potential spread of the pandemic ( 6 ) .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	research has also found that testing and isolating or quarantining infected persons may mitigate the spread of the infection ( 7 ) .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	these estimations use epidemiologic models such as the suspected - infected - recovery ( sir ) model to project the number of infected cases , number of deaths and potential demand for health care , specially hospital icu use during times of the peak of pandemic ( 8) .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	subsequent studies focused on the impact of npi on the spread of the disease .

4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	without strong npi , the study estimated that r 0 , which is a measure of rate of infection transmission , could be about 2.4 and about 80 % of the population would be infected in uk and us and about 2.2 m people would die in usa alone .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	with npi and other mitigation efforts , the study noted that health care system would be overwhelmed and deaths in us would reach about 1.1 m to 1.2 m people .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	less than two weeks later , a study by murray et al ( 10 ) predicted that even with strong npi estimated deaths over a 4month period would be about 81,000 in the us .
4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	a canadian study estimated initial infection rate of 56 % in ontario , canada and npi could reduce that infection rate to 2%(11 ) .

5e095761210e537f91067c12ce46f396c0338175	currently , treating covid-19 patients , particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia , is challenging as no specific drugs or vaccines against sars - cov-2 are available .
5e095761210e537f91067c12ce46f396c0338175	therefore , msc therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the sars - cov-2 infection found in this study is striking .
5e095761210e537f91067c12ce46f396c0338175	additional studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate this therapeutic intervention further , however .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	background - family caregivers are integral to patient care in bangladeshi public hospitals .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	this study explored family caregivers ' activities and their perceptions and practices related to disease transmission and prevention in public hospitals .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	methods - trained qualitative researchers conducted a total of 48 hours of observation in 3 public tertiary care hospitals and 12 in - depth interviews with family caregivers .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	results - family caregivers provided care 24 hours a day , including bedside nursing , cleaning care , and psychologic support .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	during observations , family members provided 2,065 episodes of care giving , 75 % ( 1,544 ) of which involved close contact with patients .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	we observed family caregivers washing their hands with soap on only 4 occasions .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	the majority of respondents said diseases are transmitted through physical contact with surfaces and objects that have been contaminated with patient secretions and excretions , and avoiding contact with these contaminated objects would help prevent disease .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	conclusion - family caregivers are at risk for hospital - acquired infection from their repeated exposure to infectious agents combined with their inadequate hand hygiene and knowledge about disease transmission .
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	future research should explore potential strategies to improve family caregivers ' knowledge about disease transmission and reduce family caregiver exposures , which may be accomplished by improving care provided by health care workers .
80d5cbaba20857c15230efbd66742fbbedcd6cb9	the purpose of this descriptive study was to , from the perspective of adult people with epilepsy ( pwe ) and caregivers of pwe , explore the effects of the current pandemic and resulting societal changes on epilepsy selfmanagement .
80d5cbaba20857c15230efbd66742fbbedcd6cb9	ninety - four respondents completed a mixed - methods quantitative and qualitative survey focused on their epilepsy self - management experiences during the coronavirus disease-19 ( covid-19 ) pandemic .
80d5cbaba20857c15230efbd66742fbbedcd6cb9	respondents noted significant disruption in epilepsy self - management .
80d5cbaba20857c15230efbd66742fbbedcd6cb9	lack of ability to obtain medications or see epilepsy providers , as well as increased stress , social isolation , and changes in routine were all reported as troublesome , and more than one - third of the sample reported an increase in seizure frequency since the onset of the pandemic .
80d5cbaba20857c15230efbd66742fbbedcd6cb9	suggestions are given regarding how to support pwe during future covid-19 outbreaks and to better prepare pwe and their caregivers for any life - altering events , such as a pandemic , with robust self - management skills that will allow them to maintain the highest level of function possible .

68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	snp and pcr - rflp optimization ) software to perform a comprehensive , whole - genome analysis to forensically discriminate multiple sequences is presented .
68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	tools for the optimization of forensic typing using single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) and pcr - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( pcr - rflp ) analyses across multiple isolate sequences of a species are described .
68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	the pcr - rflp analysis includes prediction and selection of optimal primers and restriction enzymes to enable maximum isolate discrimination based on sequence information .
68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	spr opt calculates all snp or pcr - rflp variations present in the sequences , groups them into haplotypes according to their co - segregation across those sequences , and performs combinatoric analyses to determine which sets of haplotypes provide maximal discrimination among all the input sequences .
68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	those set combinations requiring that membership in the fewest haplotypes be queried ( i.e. the fewest assays be performed ) are found .
68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	these analyses highlight variable regions based on existing sequence data .
68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	these markers may be heterogeneous among unsequenced isolates as well , and thus may be useful for characterizing the relationships among unsequenced as well as sequenced isolates .
68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	the predictions are multi - locus .

7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	the objectives of this study were ( i ) to develop a tool ( ccu - ohqol ) to assess ohqol amongst patients admitted to ccu , ( ii ) to collect data to analyse the validity , reliability and acceptability of the ccu - ohqol tool and ( iii ) to investigate patient - reported outcome measures of ohqol in patients hospitalised in a ccu .
7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	methods
7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	the project included three phases : ( 1 ) the development of an initial questionnaire informed by a literature review and expert panel , ( 2 ) testing of the tool in ccu ( n = 18 ) followed by semi - structured interviews to assess acceptability , face and content validity and
7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	( 3 ) final tool modification and testing of ccu - ohqol questionnaire to assess validity and reliability .
7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	results
7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	the ccu - ohqol showed good face and content validity and was quick to administer .
7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	cronbach 's alpha was 0.72 suggesting good internal consistency .
7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	for construct validity , the ccu - ohqol was strongly and significantly correlated ( correlation coefficients 0.71 , 0.62 and 0.77 , p < 0.01 ) with global ohqol items .
7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	in the validation study , 37.8 % of the participants reported a deterioration in self - reported oral health after ccu admission .

413227edb89564cc432e35e54b4455e72f44e8d1	in this study , the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the amino terminal half of the s glycoprotein gene of one korean field tgev strain ( 133 ) isolated in 1997 and three korean field tgev strains ( kt2 , kt3 and kt4 ) isolated in 2000 and hkt2 strain , kt2 passaged 104 times in st cells , were determined .
413227edb89564cc432e35e54b4455e72f44e8d1	the amino terminal half of the s glycoprotein gene including antigenic sites a , b , c and d , were amplified by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) .
413227edb89564cc432e35e54b4455e72f44e8d1	amplified pcr products were cloned , sequenced , and compared with published sequences for non - korean tgev strains .
413227edb89564cc432e35e54b4455e72f44e8d1	korea tgev field strains had 98.5 - 99.5 % nucleotide sequence and 97.2 - 99.0 % amino acid sequence similarity with each other .

286700f1ebaaabe1a535c42c9f3d0a37be23491a	cypa suppresses t - cell activation through cyclosporine complexation and is required for effective hiv-1 replication in host cells .
286700f1ebaaabe1a535c42c9f3d0a37be23491a	we show that cypa is acetylated in diverse human cell lines and use a synthetically evolved acetyllysyl - trna synthetase / trna cua pair to produce recombinant acetylated cypa in escherichia coli .
286700f1ebaaabe1a535c42c9f3d0a37be23491a	we determined atomic - resolution structures of acetylated cypa and its complexes with cyclosporine and hiv-1 capsid .
286700f1ebaaabe1a535c42c9f3d0a37be23491a	acetylation markedly inhibited cypa catalysis of cis to trans isomerization and stabilized cis rather than trans forms of the hiv-1 capsid .
286700f1ebaaabe1a535c42c9f3d0a37be23491a	furthermore , cypa acetylation antagonized the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine by inhibiting the sequential steps of cyclosporine binding and calcineurin inhibition .
286700f1ebaaabe1a535c42c9f3d0a37be23491a	our results reveal that acetylation regulates key functions of cypa in immunity and viral infection and provide a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation modulates interactions to regulate cell function .

5a0f78d157629e8929ac78ea6da0f0148f5900a8	therapeutic medicine today includes a vast number of procedures involving the use of biomaterials , transplantation of therapeutic cells or cell clusters , as well as of solid organs .
5a0f78d157629e8929ac78ea6da0f0148f5900a8	these treatment modalities are obviously of great benefit to the patient , but also present a great challenge to the innate immune system , since they involve direct exposure of non - biological materials , cells of non - hematological origin as well as endothelial cells , damaged by ischemia - perfusion in solid organs to proteins and cells in the blood .
5a0f78d157629e8929ac78ea6da0f0148f5900a8	the result of such an exposure may be an inappropriate activation of the complement and contact / kallikrein systems , which produce mediators capable of triggering the platelets and pmns and monocytes , which can ultimately result in thrombotic and inflammatory ( i.e. , a thrombo - inflammatory ) response to the treatment modality .
5a0f78d157629e8929ac78ea6da0f0148f5900a8	in this concept review , we give an overview of the mechanisms of recognition within the innate immunity system , with the aim to identify suitable points for intervention .
5a0f78d157629e8929ac78ea6da0f0148f5900a8	finally , we discuss emerging and promising techniques for surface modification of biomaterials and cells with specific inhibitors in order to diminish thromboinflammation and improve clinical outcome .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	covid-19 is undoubtedly the most impactful viral disease of the current century , afflicting millions worldwide .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	as yet , there is not an approved vaccine , as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	we hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against sars - cov-2 .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	using in silico approaches , we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against sars - cov-2 and then tested them in vitro .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	overall , we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations , 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose - dependent manner .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	among the 16 synergistic cases , combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds ( remdesivir , amodiaquine and umifenovir ) were the most notable , all exhibiting significant synergy against sars - cov-2 .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	the combination of nitazoxanide , an fda - approved drug , and remdesivir , fda emergency use authorization for the treatment of covid-19 , demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	notably , the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism .
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	overall , our results emphasize the importance of both drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for potential therapeutic use against sars - cov-2 infections .

a8211f17587bc74889f33658df638c91eb8443f1	this aspect simplifies the estimation process , but does not consider the influence of relatively small changes in the design variables in terms of the objective function .
a8211f17587bc74889f33658df638c91eb8443f1	in this work , the sidr ( susceptible , infected , dead and recovered ) model is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease , and its parameters are estimated by formulating a robust inverse problem , that is , considering the sensitivity of design variables .
a8211f17587bc74889f33658df638c91eb8443f1	for this purpose , a robust multiobjective optimization problem is formulated , considering the minimization of uncertainties associated to the estimation process and the maximization of the robustness parameter .
a8211f17587bc74889f33658df638c91eb8443f1	to solve this problem , the multi - objective stochastic fractal search algorithm is associated with the effective mean concept for the evaluation of robustness .
a8211f17587bc74889f33658df638c91eb8443f1	the results obtained considering real data of the epidemic in china demonstrate that the evaluation of the sensitivity of the design variables can provide more reliable results .

cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	we carried out this retrospective study to share our experience of esophageal replacement .
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	methodology
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	this study was conducted at the department of pediatric surgery the children 's hospital and the institute of child health , lahore .
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	the records of patients treated for esophageal replacement were reviewed .
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	the patients under followup were called for clinical evaluation and assessed of long terms complications if any .
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	results
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	a total of 93 patients with esophageal replacement were included in the study .
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	esophageal replacement was done with gastric transposition in 84 cases ( 90 % ) , colon interposition in 7 cases ( 7.5 % ) including one case of redo colonic interposition , and jejunal interposition in 2 cases ( 2 % ) .
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	routes of esophageal replacement were trans - hiatal in 71 ( 76 % ) , retrosternal in 13 ( 14 % ) , and trans - hiatal with thoracotomy in 9 ( 10 % ) patients .
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	postoperatively , all of the conduits maintained viability .

cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	there are problems with esophageal replacement in developing countries .
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	in this context , gastric conduit appeared as the best conduit for esophageal replacement , using the trans - hiatal route for replacement , in the authors ' experience .
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	generalizing covid-19 control strategies in one community to others is confounded by community 's unique demographic and socioeconomic attributes .
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	here we propose a tailored dynamic model accounting for community - specific transmission controls and medical resource availability .
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	we trained the model using data from wuhan and applied it to other countries .
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	we show that isolating suspected cases is most effective in reducing transmission rate if the intervention starts early .
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	having more hospital beds provides leverage that diminishes with delayed intervention onset .
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	the importance of transmission control in turn increases by 65 % with a 7-day delay .
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	furthermore , prolonging outbreak duration by applying an intermediate , rather than strict , transmission control would not prevent hospital overload regardless of bed capacity , and would likely result in a high ratio ( 21 % ~ 84 % ) of the population being infected but not treated .
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	the model could help different countries design control policies and gauge the severity of suppression failure .

e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	( sars - cov-2 ) , is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic .
e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease , neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly .
e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	on the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses , especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respi ratory syndrome epidemics , cases of cns and peripheral nervous system disease caused by sars - cov-2 might be expected to be rare .
e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	a growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients , but many have insufficient detail , reflecting the challenge of studying such patients .

e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	recognition of neurological disease associated with sars - cov-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging , especially if the primary covid-19 illness occurred weeks earlier .
e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	the proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small .
e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	however , these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae .
e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	with so many people infected , the overall number of neurological patients , and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large .

6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	existing methods for preparing influenza vaccines pose the greatest challenge against highly pandemic avian influenza h7n9 outbreak in the poultry and humans .
6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	exploring a new strategy for manufacturing and delivering a safe and effective h7n9 vaccine is needed urgently .
6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	results :
6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	an alternative approach is to develop an influenza h7n9 oral vaccine based on yeast display technology in a timely manner .
6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	hemagglutinin ( ha ) of a / anhui/1/2013 ( ah - h7n9 ) is used as a model antigen and characterized its expression on the surface of saccharomyces cerevisiae ( s.cerevisiae
6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	) eby 100 .
6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	mice administrated orally with s.cerevisiae eby100 / pyd5-ha produced significant titers of igg antibody as well as significant amounts of cytokines ifn - γ and il-4 .
6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	importantly , s.cerevisiae eby100 / pyd5-ha could provide effective immune protection against homologous a/ anhui/1/2013 ( ah - h7n9 ) virus challenge .
6395b30d33a4301d50c33c21c2d37e949f8acac8	our findings suggest that platform based on yeast surface technology provides an alternative approach to prepare a promising influenza h7n9 oral vaccine candidate that can significantly shorten the preparedness period and result in effective protection against influenza a pandemic .
de0f0fe236475ea98c9c5307a5ac7acb0e706c8a	since the outbreak of covid-19 , clinicians have tried every effort to fight the disease , and multiple drugs have been proposed .
de0f0fe236475ea98c9c5307a5ac7acb0e706c8a	however , no proven effective therapies currently exist , and different clinical phenotypes complicate the situation .
de0f0fe236475ea98c9c5307a5ac7acb0e706c8a	in clinical practice , many severe or critically ill covid-19 patients developed gastrointestinal ( gi ) disturbances , including vomiting , diarrhoea , or abdominal pain , even in the absence of cough and dyspnea .
de0f0fe236475ea98c9c5307a5ac7acb0e706c8a	understanding the mechanism of gi disturbances is warranted for exploring better clinical care for covid-19 patients .
de0f0fe236475ea98c9c5307a5ac7acb0e706c8a	with evidence collected from clinical studies on covid-19 and basic research on a rare genetic disease ( i.e. , hartnup disorder ) , we put forward a novel hypothesis to elaborate an effective nutritional therapy .
de0f0fe236475ea98c9c5307a5ac7acb0e706c8a	we hypothesize that sars - cov-2 spike protein , binding to intestinal angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 , negatively regulates the absorption of neutral amino acids , and this could explain not only the gi , but also systemic disturbances in covid-19 .

06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	japanese encephalitis virus ( jev ) has a single - stranded , positive - sense rna genome containing a single open reading frame flanked by the 59-and 39-noncoding regions ( ncrs ) .
06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	the virus genome replicates via a negative - sense rna intermediate .
06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	the ncrs and their complementary sequences in the negative - sense rna are the sites for assembly of the rna replicase complex thereby regulating the rna synthesis and virus replication .
06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	in this study , we show that the 55-kda polypyrimidine tract - binding protein ( ptb ) interacts in vitro with both the 59-ncr of the positive - sense genomic rna -5ncr(+ ) , and its complementary sequence in the negative - sense replication intermediate rna -3ncr(- ) .
06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	the interaction of viral rna with ptb was validated in infected cells by jev rna co - immunoprecipitation and jev rna - ptb colocalization experiments .
06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	interestingly , we observed phosphorylation - coupled translocation of nuclear ptb to cytoplasmic foci that colocalized with jev rna early during jev infection .
06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	our studies employing the ptb silencing and over - expression in cultured cells established an inhibitory role of ptb in jev replication .

06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	we show that ptb competitively inhibits association of jev 3ncr(- )
06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	rna with viral rna - dependent rna polymerase ( ns5 protein ) , an event required for the synthesis of the plussense genomic rna .

06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	we show that cells treated with a camp analogue had an enhanced level of phosphorylated ptb in the cytoplasm and a significantly suppressed jev replication .

27df1fc2fa0fab2bd274ee77148eaadcb6b513db	the pandemic of sars - cov-2 has caused a high number of deaths in the world .
27df1fc2fa0fab2bd274ee77148eaadcb6b513db	to combat it , it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells .
27df1fc2fa0fab2bd274ee77148eaadcb6b513db	infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell - surface glycans like heparan sulfate ( hs ) and sialic acid - containing oligosaccharides .
27df1fc2fa0fab2bd274ee77148eaadcb6b513db	in this study , we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike ( s ) proteins of sars - cov-2 and sars - cov , mers - cov to these glycans .
27df1fc2fa0fab2bd274ee77148eaadcb6b513db	our results revealed that the s proteins and subunits can bind to hs in a sulfation - dependent manner , the length of hs is not a critical factor for the binding , and no binding with sialic acid residues was detected .
27df1fc2fa0fab2bd274ee77148eaadcb6b513db	overall , this work suggests that hs binding may be a general mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells , and supports the potential importance of hs in infection and in the development of antiviral agents against these viruses .
875ffe38994f1db831cf3a2e765d21d7e96e7fb3	introduction a widely - used method for diagnosing covid-19 is the nucleic acid test based on real - time reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) .
875ffe38994f1db831cf3a2e765d21d7e96e7fb3	however , the sensitivity of real time rt - pcr tests is low and it can take up to 8 hours to receive the test results .
875ffe38994f1db831cf3a2e765d21d7e96e7fb3	radiologic methods can provide higher sensitivity .

95687de5baf7b91c20058f1c819580ab872ddc6a	newly available data sets present an exciting opportunity to investigate how human population movement contributes to the spread of infectious diseases across large geographical distances .
95687de5baf7b91c20058f1c819580ab872ddc6a	it is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global - scale epidemics .
95687de5baf7b91c20058f1c819580ab872ddc6a	nevertheless , a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement , and whether one 's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes .
95687de5baf7b91c20058f1c819580ab872ddc6a	we adapt three well - studied models of infectious disease dynamics , the sir model ; the sis model ; and the ross - macdonald model , to incorporate either of two candidate movement models .
95687de5baf7b91c20058f1c819580ab872ddc6a	we describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model 's results , finding that in all cases there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes .
95687de5baf7b91c20058f1c819580ab872ddc6a	we further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on bioko island , equatorial guinea , finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of r 0 while the other produces nonsensical results .

49f7f726a602a3e20d2525a7b696fd4a41d8430c	herein , we described a unique fluorescence resonance energy transferbased microarray platform for real - time quantification of nucleic acid targets that combines advantages of both and reduces their limitations .
49f7f726a602a3e20d2525a7b696fd4a41d8430c	a set of 3 0 amino - modified taqman probes were designed and immobilized on a glass slide composing a regular microarray pattern , and used as probes in the consecutive pcr carried out on the surface .
49f7f726a602a3e20d2525a7b696fd4a41d8430c	during the extension step of the pcr , 5 0 nuclease activity of dna polymerase will cleave quencher dyes of the immobilized probe in the presence of nucleic acids targets .
49f7f726a602a3e20d2525a7b696fd4a41d8430c	the increase of fluorescence intensities generated by the change in physical distance between reporter fluorophore and quencher moiety of the probes were collected by a confocal scanner .
49f7f726a602a3e20d2525a7b696fd4a41d8430c	using this new approach we successfully monitored five different pathogenic genomic dnas and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of fluorescence intensity changes on the taqman probe array .
49f7f726a602a3e20d2525a7b696fd4a41d8430c	the results indicate that the taqman probe array on a planar glass slide monitors dna targets with excellent specificity as well as high sensitivity .
49f7f726a602a3e20d2525a7b696fd4a41d8430c	this set - up offers the great advantage of real - time quantitative detection of dna targets in a parallel array format .

5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	destruction of the architectural and subsequently the functional integrity of the lung following pulmonary viral infections is attributable to both the extent of pathogen replication and to the host - generated inflammation associated with the recruitment of immune responses .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	the presence of antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence of novel viruses assures the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	thus , there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune responses in the lung but which limits immune - mediated lung damage .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	the immunoprophylactic strategy described here utilizes a protein cage nanoparticle ( pcn ) to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary infection and also results in a host immune response that causes less lung damage .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	methodology / principal findings : mice pre - treated with pcn , independent of any specific viral antigens , were protected against both sub - lethal and lethal doses of two different influenza viruses , a mouse - adapted sars - coronavirus , or mouse pneumovirus .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	treatment with pcn significantly increased survival and was marked by enhanced viral clearance , accelerated induction of viral - specific antibody production , and significant decreases in morbidity and lung damage .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	the enhanced protection appears to be dependent upon the prior development of inducible bronchus - associated lymphoid tissue ( ibalt ) in the lung in response to the pcn treatment and to be mediated through cd4 + t cell and b cell dependent mechanisms .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	conclusions / significance : the immunoprophylactic strategy described utilizes an infection - independent induction of naturally occurring ibalt
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	prior to infection by a pulmonary viral pathogen .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	this strategy non - specifically enhances primary immunity to respiratory viruses and is not restricted by the antigen specificities inherent in typical vaccination strategies .
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	pcn treatment is asymptomatic in its application and importantly , ameliorates the damaging inflammation normally associated with the recruitment of immune responses into the lung .

3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2	as the chinese population makes up more than one fifth of the population worldwide , it is important to develop hcmv vaccines more specific for the chinese population by targeting chinese - restricted hla alleles and antigens .
3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2	in the present study , we designed a novel chimeric polyepitope vaccine based on the replication - deficient adenovirus ad5f35 , which encodes 83 hcmv t cell epitopes from 15 different hcmv antigens , restricted to 14 hla i and 7 hla ii alleles that cover 92 % of the chinese population .
3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2	our results show that the recombinant adenovirus vaccine ad5f35-ctláth can be efficiently transfected and expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) with little cytopathic activity .
3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2	ad5f35-ctláth can also be endogenously processed and presented by pbmcs .
3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2	ad5f35-ctláth - stimulated hcmv - specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctls ) showed strong cytolytic activity against hcmv polyepitope - sensitized target cells .
3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2	the ctl activity was accompanied by high levels of ifn - c production after ad5f35-ctláth stimulation .
3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2	the specificity and vigorous response to the recombinant adenovirus vaccine in vitro makes it a potential candidate to be used for transplantation recipients or congenitally infected infants .

d8a6ceb412593e209b235ebe112df929d2721e76	in this study , we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the rna synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates .
d8a6ceb412593e209b235ebe112df929d2721e76	our observations suggest mutations in nsp14 , an error - correcting exonuclease protein , have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome , compared to nsp7 , 8 , and 12 , which form the core polymerase complex .
d8a6ceb412593e209b235ebe112df929d2721e76	we propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in sars - cov-2 isolates , and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains .
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) is an acute respiratory disease with significant morbidity and mortality .
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	while its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied , its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood .
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	a limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage .
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	other organs affected include the kidneys , brain , digestive tract , heart , liver , thyroid gland and urogenital tract .

d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules , cerebral neurons , and immune cells .
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	the pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury .
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus .
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	indirect injury mainly results from immune responses , circulatory dysfunction , and hypoxia .
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	in this review , we summarize the major pathological findings at the gross , cellular and molecular levels and discuss the various possible mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of sars .

83da89e0732df8a728760bccb91c894ef2457563	the probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected at any one point in time ( the force of infection ) is related to the number of infectious individuals in the population , will change over time , and will feed back into the future force of infection .
83da89e0732df8a728760bccb91c894ef2457563	these nonlinear interactions produce transmission dynamics that require specific consideration when mod - eling an intervention that has an impact on the transmission of a pathogen .

942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	total petroleum hydrocarbons ( tph ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are important pollutants that affect public health in urban areas , especially in developing and oil - rich countries such as iran .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	this assesses the relationship between tph and pahs in street dust and suspended dust , and investigates toxicity level in the urban environment of the most important petrochemical center in iran .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	for this purpose , 21 and 48 street dust samples were collected for tph analysis and pah analysis , respectively , in asaluyeh county .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	moreover , seven air dust samples were taken for pah analysis .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	tph concentrations ranged between 240 and 4400 mg kg −1 , with a mean of 1371.43 mg kg −1 .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	the maximum ∑pah concentration ( 6016.3 mg kg −1 ) was detected in a petrochemical complex while the minimum ∑pahs content ( 16.93 mg kg −1 ) was measured in an urban area .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	the mean concentrations of total pahs in street dust particles were 491.35 mg kg −1 in summer and 304.04 mg kg −1 in winter .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	the results indicated that pah concentration in summer was higher .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	pah sources were identified using both pahs ratios and robust statistical methods such as generalized estimating equations ( gee ) , backward gee , logistic regression , principal components analysis ( pca ) in conjunction with multiple linear regression ( mlr ) and positive matrix factorization ( pmf ) .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	the results showed that pah species generally originate from pyrogenic sources and about 0.08 % of tph was typically pahs .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	however , petrogenic sources of pahs in the industrial areas were 11.2 times more abundant than in urban areas .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	also , backward gee model demonstrated that tph is more influenced by hmw pahs , particularly indene .
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	estimated incremental lifetime cancer risk ( ilcr ) was higher than 10 -4 , showing that asaluyeh inhabitants ( especially children and indoor workers ) are probably exposed to cancer risk , particularly through dermal contact and dust ingestion .
65e75eee2be655f5569905fc3b98a26e099fc5a6	due to its noninvasive nature and ease of use , there is cincreasing interest for transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation ( tvns ) as a neuromodulation technique .
65e75eee2be655f5569905fc3b98a26e099fc5a6	however , like many emerging fields in medical science , tvns is hampered by a proliferation of small - scale uninformative and underpowered studies .
65e75eee2be655f5569905fc3b98a26e099fc5a6	these studies typically report positive effects that remain unreplicated .
65e75eee2be655f5569905fc3b98a26e099fc5a6	another potential point of concern is the device manufacturers ' involvement in many of those studies , which further enhances the risk of a systematic bias in the literature ( 1 ) .

2000b56ab7a60199d3bbb2148295370ae87b3d58	note that figure s1 bears a close resemblance to supplementary information figure 1 of [ 1 ] , for the 1918 h1n1 pandemic influenza ( n=94 ) .
2000b56ab7a60199d3bbb2148295370ae87b3d58	also , for these cases , which correspond to hospitalizations in most cases , the mode of the time between onset of symptoms and death is about 9 days .
2000b56ab7a60199d3bbb2148295370ae87b3d58	we calculated the average number of cases per week ( λ = 0.73 ) from reported cases , and verified that case introductions of avian influenza , taken as a fixed large fraction of cases , are not well modelled by a homogeneous poisson process with mean λ ( figure s2 ) .

1ed0667897d6fcba12babaac4e53430ab7a111d2	such diseases spread mainly through person - to - person contacts .
1ed0667897d6fcba12babaac4e53430ab7a111d2	health care authorities recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast population .
1ed0667897d6fcba12babaac4e53430ab7a111d2	although several mobile applications have been developed to trace contacts , they typically require collection of privacy - intrusive information such as gps locations , and the logging of privacy - sensitive data on a third party server , or require additional infrastructure such as wifi aps with known locations .
1ed0667897d6fcba12babaac4e53430ab7a111d2	in this paper , we introduce contain , a privacy - oriented mobile contact tracing application that does not rely on gps or any other form of infrastructure - based location sensing , nor the continuous logging of any other personally identifiable information on a server .
1ed0667897d6fcba12babaac4e53430ab7a111d2	the goal of contain is to allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short distance , specifically , bluetooth wireless range , of someone that is infected , and potentially also when .

28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	it is the duty of any society to be responsive to such challenges by relying on the best tools and logic available to analyze the costs and benefits of any mitigative action .
28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	we here provide a mathematical model to explore the epidemiological consequences of allowing standard intake and unaltered within - jail operational dynamics to be maintained during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic , and contrast this with proposed interventions to reduce the burden of negative health outcomes .
28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	in this way , we provide estimates of the infection risks , and likely loss of life , that arise from current incarceration practices .
28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	we provide estimates for in - custody deaths and show how the within - jail dynamics lead to spill - over risks , not only affecting the incarcerated people , but increasing the exposure , infection , and death rates for both corrections officers with whom they interact within the jail system , and the broader community beyond the justice system .
28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	we show that , given a typical jail - community dynamic , operating in a business as usual way will result in significant and rapid loss of life .
28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	large scale reductions in arrest and speeding of releases are likely to save the lives of incarcerated people , staff and the community at large .
28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	as the covid-19 pandemic sweeps the globe , one of the critical functions of 2 epidemiology is to consider how society can transform current practice to increase the 3 health and safety of the public .
28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	the widespread risk of infection and the high case 4 fatality rates , especially in older or medically compromised populations , mean that we , 5 as a society , must be willing to consider structural reforms to our institutions to 6 promote an overall greater good .

c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	there is some evidence that exam results are worse when students are acutely exposed to air pollution .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	studies investigating the association between air pollution and academic attainment have been constrained by small sample sizes .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	cross sectional educational attainment data ( 2009 -2015 ) from students aged 15 - 16 years in cardiff , wales were linked to primary health care data , modelled air pollution and measured pollen data , and analysed using multilevel linear regression models .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	annual cohort , school and individual level confounders were adjusted for in single and multipollutant / pollen models .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	we stratified by treatment of asthma and/or seasonal allergic rhinitis ( sar ) .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	a unit ( 10ug / m3 ) increase of short - term exposure to no 2 was associated with 0.044

c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	this association remained statistically significant after controlling for other pollutants and pollen .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	there was no association of pm 2.5 , o 3 , or pollen with standardised cps remaining after adjustment .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	we found no evidence that treatment for asthma or sar modified the observed no 2 effect on educational attainment .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	our study showed that short - term exposure to traffic - related air pollution , specifically no 2 , was associated with detrimental educational attainment for students aged 15 - 16 .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	longitudinal investigations in different settings are required to confirm this possible impact 2 and further work may uncover the long - term economic implications , and degree to which impacts are cumulative and permanent .
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	air pollution estimates for home and school locations were linked to individual outcomes short term exposure to no 2 was associated with lower educational attainment treatment for asthma or hayfever did not modify the effect of pollution on educational attainment
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	a research agenda using longitudinal population - based data linkage is proposed

a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	we found a range of useful guidance but no published experience of implementing these approaches .
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	we experienced outbreaks of covid-19 on two secure forensic units with 13 patients and 10 staff becoming positive .
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	one patient died .

715ec0aac4ad78092007345159945afa560b3f05	the international response to the west african ebola virus disease epidemic has exemplified the great potential of the global public health community .
715ec0aac4ad78092007345159945afa560b3f05	however , the protracted early response also revealed critical gaps , which likely resulted in exacerbation of the epidemic .

715ec0aac4ad78092007345159945afa560b3f05	it is incumbent on international health partners to learn from missteps that occurred in the early stages of the epidemic and strengthen our public health capacity to better respond to future public health emergencies .
f7284aa17e76827de5ba8edcd1e89acf2a63f9c2	the devastating spread of the novel coronavirus , named covid-19 , starting its journey from wuhan province of china on january 21 st , 2020 , has now threatened lives of almost all the countries of the world in different magnitudes .
f7284aa17e76827de5ba8edcd1e89acf2a63f9c2	mostly the developed countries have been hit hard , besides the emerging countries like china , india and brazil .

a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	however death is rarely by hypoxemia but by abdominal organ failure .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	we have shown that abdominal lymph drainage is impeded with mechanical ventilation [ 1 ] and this raises the question whether abdominal edema is increased during mechanical ventilation .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	twenty 2 - 3 months old pigs with a mean weight of 28 kg were studied during anesthesia and mechanical ventilation .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	a sepsis - like condition was created by continuous infusion of lipopolysacharide , lps , and the pigs were followed for 6 hours .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	99tc - labelled red blood cells were used as an intra - vascular marker and 111in - labelled transferrin as an intra - and extravascular marker of abdominal fluid as detected by gamma - camera technique .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	healthy pigs showed a slight increase in free abdominal fluid over a 6-hour study period .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	lps caused a three - to - eight fold increase in the rate of ascites formation and abdominal organ swelling .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	mechanical ventilation ( mv ) with a low level of end - expiratory airway pressure ( peep of 5 cmh2o ) increased abdominal fluid formation by 10 % compared to spontaneous breathing ( sb ) .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	mv with peep of 15 cm h2o caused a significant rise by 80 % compared to sb ( p < 0.01 ) and also liver swelling .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	free fluid estimation correlated to post mortem measurements ( p < 0.05 ) .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	with the double isotope technique , abdominal edema formation can be followed continuously in experimental conditions .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	moreover , abdominal edema formation is enhanced by mechanical ventilation and in particular with peep .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	the findings suggest that the most commonly used techniques of improving oxygenation in acute respiratory failure worsen abdominal fluid balance with organ swelling and increased ascites .
a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	the consequences of this have to be studied .

3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	backgrounds : electronic medical records ( emr ) form a rich repository of information that could benefit public health .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	we asked how structured and free - text narrative emr data should be combined to improve epidemic surveillance for acute respiratory infections ( ari ) .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	methods :
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	eight previously characterized ari case detection algorithms ( cda ) were applied to historical emr entries to create authentic time series of daily ari case counts ( background ) .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	an epidemic model simulated influenza cases ( injection ) .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	from the time of the injection , cluster - detection statistics were applied daily on paired background+injection ( combined ) and background - only time series .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	this cycle was then repeated with the injection shifted to each week of the evaluation year .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	we computed : a )
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	the time from injection to the first statistical alarm uniquely found in the combined dataset ( detection delay )
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	; b )
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	how often alarms originated in the background - only dataset ( false - alarm rate , or far ) ; and c )
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	the number of cases found within these false alarms ( caseload ) .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	for each cda , we plotted the detection delay as a function of far or caseload , over a broad range of alarm thresholds .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	results : cdas that combined text analyses seeking ari symptoms in clinical notes with provider - assigned diagnostic codes in order to maximize the precision rather than the sensitivity of case - detection lowered detection delay at any given far or caseload .
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	conclusion :
3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	an empiric approach can guide the integration of emr data into case - detection methods that improve both the timeliness and efficiency of epidemic detection .

a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	reactivation in pregnancy is associated with a myriad of adverse infant outcomes .
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	however , the role of host genetic polymorphisms in modulating maternal cmv status is inconclusive .
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	this study investigated the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in toll - like receptor ( tlr ) and cytokine genes with maternal plasma cmv dna status in black zimbabweans .
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	methods :
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	in a cross - sectional study , 110 women in late gestation who included 36 cmv infected cases and 74 cmv uninfected , age and hiv status matched controls were enrolled .
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 genes which code for proteins involved in immunity against cmv were genotyped using iplex gold

a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	( ifnar1 ) genes are being reported here for the first time in a zimbabwean population .
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	the allele frequencies in the zimbabwean population are generally comparable to other african populations but different when compared to european and asian populations .
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	conclusions : toll - like receptor and interleukin genetic polymorphisms influence cmv status in late gestation among black zimbabweans .
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	this is attributable to possible modulation of immune responses to cmv reactivation in a population previously exposed to cmv infection .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	the cytopathic effects of zika virus ( zikv ) are poorly characterized .

693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	here , we studied the morphological cellular changes induced by zikv and addressed the role of interferon - induced transmembrane proteins ( ifitm ) , a family of broad - spectrum antiviral factors , during viral replication .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	we report that zikv induces massive vacuolization followed by " implosive " cell death in human epithelial cells , primary skin fibroblasts and astrocytes , a phenomenon which is exacerbated when ifitm3 levels are low .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	it is reminiscent of paraptosis , a caspase - independent , non - apoptotic form of cell death associated with the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	we further show that zikv - induced vacuoles are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) and dependent on the pi3k / akt signaling axis .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	inhibiting the sec61 er translocon in zikv - infected cells blocked vacuole formation and viral production .
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	our results provide mechanistic insight behind the zikv - induced cytopathic effect and indicate that ifitm3 , by acting as a gatekeeper for incoming virus , restricts virus takeover of the er and subsequent cell death .
23fa4477a0f945ac46e749d9efa1396d34a6f963	the exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date .
23fa4477a0f945ac46e749d9efa1396d34a6f963	the relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined , which is affected by environmental conditions , human behaviour , the host and the microorganism .

170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	emerging infectious diseases are considered as a pressing challenge to global public health .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	throughout public health response to emerging infectious diseases , emergency nurses are situated at the forefront of the healthcare system .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	the present study has explored emergency nurses ' perceptions regarding the risks appraisal of the threat of the emerging infectious disease situation in emergency department context .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	methods :
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	the present study used a qualitative descriptive approach .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	a purposive sampling method was employed to recruit emergency nurses who worked in public hospitals in hong kong .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	semi - structured interviews were conducted to 24 emergency nurses .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	the data were interpreted using a thematic analysis strategy .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	results :
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	five overarching themes emerged from the data : ( 1 ) the novelty of an emerging infectious disease , ( 2 ) the severity of an emerging infectious disease , ( 3 ) the proximity to an emerging infectious disease , ( 4 ) the complexity of an emerging infectious disease situation , and ( 5 ) the response levels towards an emerging infectious disease situation .
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	conclusion :
170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	it is anticipated that the information may help to predict the attitudes and behaviours of emergency nurses in future impending epidemic events , enhancing emergency nurses ' preparedness towards in such situations .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	background social distancing - when people limit close contact with others outside their household - is a primary intervention available to combat the covid-19 pandemic .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	the importance of social distancing is unlikely to change until effective treatments or vaccines become widely available .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	however , relatively little is known about how best to promote social distancing .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	applying knowledge from social and behavioral research on conventional health behaviors ( e.g. , smoking , physical activity ) to support public health efforts and research on social distancing is promising , but empirical evidence supporting this approach is needed .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	purpose we examined whether one type of social distancing behavior - reduced movement outside the homewas associated with conventional health behaviors .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	method we examined the association between gpsderived movement behavior in 2,858 counties in usa from march 1 to april 7 , 2020 and the prevalence of county - level indicators influenced by residents ' conventional health behaviors .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	results changes in movement were associated with conventional health behaviors , and the magnitude of these associations were similar to the associations among the conventional health behaviors .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	counties with healthier behaviors - particularly less obesity and greater physical activity - evidenced greater reduction in movement outside the home during the initial phases of the pandemic in the usa .
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	conclusions social distancing , in the form of reduced movement outside the home , is associated with conventional health behaviors .

561211ed199b50721dd36afce10acd2ded4f3f0e	however , a common issue in mastery learning is that persistence is not always productive , a construct termed wheel - spinning .
561211ed199b50721dd36afce10acd2ded4f3f0e	in this paper , we extend on prior work to develop wheel - spinning detectors in the assistments learning system that distinguish between non - persistence , productive persistence and wheel - spinning .
561211ed199b50721dd36afce10acd2ded4f3f0e	to understand how quickly we can detect each state , we use data from different numbers of practice opportunities and compare model performance across student - problem set pairs .
561211ed199b50721dd36afce10acd2ded4f3f0e	we identify that a model constructed using data from the first nine practice opportunities outperforms models using less practice data .
561211ed199b50721dd36afce10acd2ded4f3f0e	however , it is possible to differentiate students who will eventually wheel - spin from learners who will persist productively using data from only the first three opportunities .

f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	currently , the emergence of a novel human coronavirus , sars - cov-2 , has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans .
f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	human - to - human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2 - 10 days , facilitating its spread via droplets , contaminated hands or surfaces .

66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	here , we conducted a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome of rhesus monkeys in a longitudinal cohort treated with an antibiotic cocktail , and we documented the interactions between the bacterial microbiome and virome .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	the depletion of viral populations was confirmed at the species level by real - time pcr .
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	we also detected changes in the gut metabolome by gc - ms and lc - ms .

17ff38a459cd10ecca962dccb5bc6d7bafdb8a4d	the world health organization declared the novel coronavirus , or covid-19 , a pandemic in march 2020 .
17ff38a459cd10ecca962dccb5bc6d7bafdb8a4d	given the severity of covid-19 , appropriate use criteria have been implemented for fetal echocardiography .
17ff38a459cd10ecca962dccb5bc6d7bafdb8a4d	screening low risk pregnancies for critical congenital heart disease has typically been a shared responsibility by pediatric cardiologists , obstetricians , and maternal fetal medicine ( mfm ) .
17ff38a459cd10ecca962dccb5bc6d7bafdb8a4d	currently , many of the fetal echocardiograms for low risk pregnancies for critical congenital heart disease have been deferred or cancelled with the emphasis on suspected abnormalities by mfms and obstetricians .
17ff38a459cd10ecca962dccb5bc6d7bafdb8a4d	in this review , we discuss the literature that has been the basis of screening of low risk pregnancies by pediatric cardiologists .

cc91e7e42e914b4bfbbca2132b5d63753c639c99	we use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95 % bootstrap confidence intervals .
cc91e7e42e914b4bfbbca2132b5d63753c639c99	the mean clinical onset serial interval and mean diagnostic serial interval were estimated to be 3.58 days ( 95 % ci : 2.62 , 4.53 ) and 3.68 days ( 95 % ci : 3.14 , 4.22 ) , respectively .
cc91e7e42e914b4bfbbca2132b5d63753c639c99	a matched sample analysis showed that the diagnostic serial interval was significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval ( estimated mean di erence -1.17 days , 95 % ci : -2.26 , -0.09 ) .
cc91e7e42e914b4bfbbca2132b5d63753c639c99	conclusions
cc91e7e42e914b4bfbbca2132b5d63753c639c99	the short diagnostic serial interval of sars - cov-2 / covid-19 in south korea may explain why south korea was able to contain the covid-19 outbreak and avoid high mortality .
cc91e7e42e914b4bfbbca2132b5d63753c639c99	we conjecture that the mean diagnostic serial interval may serve as a predictor for the success of a country 's containment e orts .

07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177	due to the high contagiousness of the infection , further spread by asymptomatic people , italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after china .
07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177	the large number of severe cases among infected people in italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients , with a heavy burden on the national health service .

07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177	we then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and regional level , for the most affected regions .
07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177	we reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases , and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases , of patients quarantined at home ( 42 % ) , hospitalized in non - intensive care ( 31 % ) , recovered or discharged ( 13 % ) , deceased ( 10 % ) , and hospitalized in intensive care ( 4 % ) .
07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177	the forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for italy of 115,000 about , and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months .
07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177	once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections , showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic .
07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177	the forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decisionmakers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic .

1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	the ph and ionic strength affect the binding affinity of the virus to cells .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	in this study , we initially investigated the effects of ph ( 4.0 - 10.0 ) and metal ions ( fe 2 + , co 2

1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	the lowest relative binding ( rb ) of hav to the cells was found at ph 4.0 and in feso 4 solution ( 64.6 % and 68.1 % , respectively ) .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	to develop an alternative to antibody - dependent immunomagnetic separation prior to detection of hav using rt - pcr , the binding of hav to five lectins , peanut agglutinin ( pna ) , dolichos biflorus agglutinin ( dba ) , helix pomatia agglutinin ( hpa ) ,
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	ulex europaeus agglutinin ( uea-1 ) and soybean agglutinin ( sba ) , was evaluated using elisas .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	sba showed significantly higher rb to hav than viruses 2014 , 6 1038
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	the other lectins tested .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	in addition , hav could be concentrated within 30 min using sba - linked magnetic bead separation ( sms ) prior to the rt - pcr assay .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using sms combined with rt - pcr to detect hav at dilutions ranging from 10 −1 -10 −4 of a hav stock ( titer : 10 4 tcid 50 /ml ) .

1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	[ 1 ] .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	hav , the prototype of the hepatovirus genus within the piconaviridae family , is composed of an icosahedral capsid that contains a positive sense single - stranded rna genome [ 2 , 3 ] .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	hav infection is associated with the consumption of virus - contaminated bivalves , including oysters , clams , cockles and mussels , which accumulate the virus from seawater as they filter - feed [ 4 ] .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	moreover , the increasingly widespread incidence of oyster - related hav infection is attracting greater attention to the mechanisms underlying the interaction between hav and oyster [ 5 ] .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	the detection of hav is influenced by the binding affinity of the virus for receptor cells , which is affected by the ph and ionic strength of the test solution , the presence of compounds competing for sorption , and the properties of the virus [ 6 ] .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	in general , low ph reduces the infectivity of enteroviruses , as it reduces the stability of virus .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	however , hav shows greater stability at low ph
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	than other enteroviruses , which increases the possibility of infection to the cells [ 7 ] .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	exposing a virus to change in ph can affect binding by altering the conformation of viral proteins e.g. , hemagglutinin and spike protein , which respectively mediate the binding of influenza and coronaviruses to the target cells [ 8 , 9 ] .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	in addition , metal compounds yield specific acids in aqueous solution , so that the ionic strength of a solution will depend on the types of metals present .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	consequently , the effects of ph and metal ions on the binding of viruses to cells are considered to be important factors for the detection of viruses in food .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	to date , however , there have been few studies addressing this issue .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	zajac et al .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	reported that ca 2 + promotes the interaction between hav and bs - c-1 cells ( monkey kidney cell line )
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	[ 10 ] , and bishop et
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	al .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	showed that low ph and divalent metal ions ( mg 2 + , ca 2 + and zn 2 + ) enhance the interaction between hav and bs
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	- c-1 cells due to changes in the viral capsid conformation [ 11 ] .
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	although these studies provide useful information on the binding of hav to bs - c-1 cells , much remains to be learned about the effects of ph and metal ions on the binding of hav to different cell types .

7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	however , based on the known and emerging biology of autoimmunity and covid-19 , it was hypothesised that while b cell depletion should not necessarily expose people to severe sars - cov-2-related issues , it may inhibit protective immunity following infection and vaccination .
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	as such , drug - induced b cell subset inhibition , that controls at least some autoimmunities , would not influence innate and cd8 t cell responses , which are central to sars - cov-2 elimination , nor the hypercoagulation and innate inflammation causing severe morbidity .
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	this is supported clinically , as the majority of sars - cov-2-infected , cd20depleted people with autoimmunity have recovered .
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	however , protective neutralizing antibody and vaccination responses are predicted to be blunted until naive b cells repopulate , based on b cell repopulation kinetics and vaccination responses , from published rituximab and unpublished ocrelizumab ( nct00676715 , nct02545868 )
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	trial data , shown here .
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	this suggests that it may be possible to undertake dose interruption to maintain inflammatory disease control , while allowing effective vaccination against sars - cov-29 , if and when an effective vaccine is available .

7ca393c6288201ab687e6521be2e123220d15e59	a multidisciplinary approach is required , but the basic differences existing between technical and health disciplines make the interaction difficult .
7ca393c6288201ab687e6521be2e123220d15e59	the multidisciplinary collaboration is still at a very early stage of development , and needs to be further understood and planned .
7ca393c6288201ab687e6521be2e123220d15e59	the author concludes stressing the need for a transversal training , but also for sharing knowledge , instruments and methods , involving all the actors in the planning process , to develop a real multidisciplinary approach .
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus - a59 ( mhv - a59 ) encodes a serine - like proteinase ( 3c - like proteinase or 3clpro ) in orf 1a of gene 1 between nucleotides 10209 and 11114 .
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	we previously have demonstrated that proteins expressed in vitro from a cdna clone of the 3clpro region possess proteinase activity , and that the proteinase is able to cleave substrate in trans .
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	we sought to determine if the 27-kda in vitro cleavage product ( p27 ) was an active form of the 3clpro and whether this was consistent with the 3clpro expressed in virus - infected cells .
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	antibodies directed against the 3clpro domain detected 27-kda mhv proteins in vitro and in mhv - a59-infected cells .
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	the 27-kda proteins were able to cleave substrate in trans without other protein cofactors or supplemental membranes , and the p27 proteinase activity was retained after purification by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis .
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	when p27 was expressed in vitro with portions of the aminoand carboxy - terminal flanking domains ( mp1 and mp2 ) , p27 was not liberated by cis cleavage .
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	the proteolytic activity of the 27-kda proteins was inhibited by a variety of cysteine and serine proteinase inhibitors , and was eliminated by the cysteine proteinase inhibitor e64d .
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	these results indicate that the 27-kda protein is a mature proteinase in mhv - a59infected cells , and that appropriate processing of this molecule occurs in vitro . ᭧

514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	hrv lrti risk - factors and outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression .
514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	results - one hundred and ten hm patients presented with hrv urti ( n=78 ) and hrv lrti ( n=32 ) .
514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	hypoalbuminemia ( or 3.0 ; 95 % ci , 1.0 -9.2 ; p=0.05 ) was independently associated with lrti , but other clinical and laboratory markers of host immunity did not differ between patients .
514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	among 92 typeable respiratory specimens , there were 58 ( 64 % )

514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	hrv - b ( 17 % ) , and hrv - c ( 29 % ) were similar .
514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	hrv - a infections occurred year - round while hrv - b and hrv - c infections clustered in the late fall and winter .
514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	conclusions - hrvs are associated with lrti in hm patients .
514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	illness severity is not attributable to specific hrv species or types .
514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	the frequent detection of bacterial co - pathogens in hrv lrtis further substantiates the hypothesis that hrvs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways , similar to that of other community - acquired respiratory viruses .

0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	soft electrothermal actuators have attracted wide attention due to their high flexibility , adaptability and light weight .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	these characteristics give them great potentials to be used in biomimetic and soft robotics applications .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	in this paper , an electrothermal actuator with directly printed microfilament heater was designed , fabricated and characterized .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	the soft actuator used polyimide ( pi ) and polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) as the structural materials due to their large mismatch of thermal expansion .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	a microfilament heater was electrohydrodynamic ( ehd ) printed using a low melting point alloy bi58 / sn42 , and embedded in - between the pi and pdms layers .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	the fabricated actuator achieved a maximum curvature of 1.0 1 cm  under a supply voltage as low as 3 v .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	resistive self - sensing technology was used to sense the deflection of the actuator and to develop the closed - loop control of the actuator .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	the bending curvature of the actuator is resulted from the temperature change of the actuator , which can be detected by the electrical resistance change of the embedded heater as they are linearly related .

0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	soft electrothermal actuators have attracted wide attention due to their high flexibility , adaptability and light weight .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	these characteristics give them great potentials to be used in biomimetic and soft robotics applications .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	in this paper , an electrothermal actuator with directly printed microfilament heater was designed , fabricated and characterized .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	the soft actuator used polyimide ( pi ) and polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) as the structural materials due to their large mismatch of thermal expansion .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	a microfilament heater was electrohydrodynamic ( ehd ) printed using a low melting point alloy bi58 / sn42 , and embedded in - between the pi and pdms layers .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	the fabricated actuator achieved a maximum curvature of 1.0 1 cm  under a supply voltage as low as 3 v .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	resistive self - sensing technology was used to sense the deflection of the actuator and to develop the closed - loop control of the actuator .
0376c49f02f2ba63edc044671c3343d8aede6a92	the bending curvature of the actuator is resulted from the temperature change of the actuator , which can be detected by the electrical resistance change of the embedded heater as they are linearly related .

01055f5d7f608ba085234b8e0d9b912bf304acd1	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) has become the third most common coronavirus that causes large - scale infections worldwide .
01055f5d7f608ba085234b8e0d9b912bf304acd1	the correlations between pathogen susceptibility and blood type distribution have attracted attention decades ago .
01055f5d7f608ba085234b8e0d9b912bf304acd1	the current retrospective study aimed to examine the correlation between blood type distribution and sars - cov-2 infection , progression , and prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) .
01055f5d7f608ba085234b8e0d9b912bf304acd1	with 265 patients from multiple medical centers and two established cohorts , we found that the blood type a population was more sensitive to sars - cov-2 .
01055f5d7f608ba085234b8e0d9b912bf304acd1	moreover , the blood type distribution was not relevant to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , acute kidney injury ( aki ) , and mortality in covid-19 patients .
01055f5d7f608ba085234b8e0d9b912bf304acd1	these findings are indicative of coping with the great threat since it probed the relationship between blood types and ards , aki , and mortality , in addition to susceptibility in covid-19 patients .
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	respiratory viruses cause disease in humans characterized by an abrupt onset of symptoms .
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	studies in humans and animal models have shown that symptoms are not immediate and appear days or even weeks after infection .
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	since the initial symptoms are a manifestation of virus recognition by elements of the innate immune response , early virus replication must go largely undetected .
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	the interval between infection and the emergence of symptoms is called the incubation period and is widely used as a clinical score .
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	while incubation periods have been described for many virus infections the underlying mechanism for this asymptomatic phase has not been comprehensively documented .
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	here we review studies of the interaction between human pathogenic respiratory rna viruses and the host with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms used by viruses to inhibit immunity .
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	we discuss the concept of the " stealth phase " , defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response .
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	we propose that the " stealth phase " phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication .

da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	the ferret ( mustela putorius furo ) represents an attractive animal model for the study of respiratory diseases , including influenza .
da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	despite its importance for biomedical research , the number of reagents for molecular and immunological analysis is restricted .
da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	we present here a parallel sequencing effort to produce an extensive est ( expressed sequence tags )
da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	dataset derived from a normalized ferret cdna library made from mrna from ferret blood , liver , lung , spleen and brain .
da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	we produced more than 500000 sequence reads that were assembled into 16000 partial ferret genes .
da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	these genes were combined with the available ferret sequences in the genbank to develop a ferret specific microarray platform .
da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	using this array , we detected tissue specific expression patterns which were confirmed by quantitative real time pcr assays .
da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	we also present a set of 41 ferret genes with even transcription profiles across the tested tissues , indicating their usefulness as housekeeping genes .
da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	the tools developed in this study allow for functional genomic analysis and make further development of reagents for the ferret model possible .
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	this study was designed to assess factors associated with a high level of knowledge about influenza among displaced persons and labor migrants in thailand .
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	we conducted a cross - sectional study of 797 documented and undocumented migrants thought to be vulnerable to influenza during the early stages of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic .
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	data were collected on socio - demographic factors , migration status , health information sources , barriers to accessing public healthcare services and influenza - related knowledge using a 201-item interviewer - assisted questionnaire .
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	among the different types of influenza , participants ' awareness of avian influenza was greatest ( 81 % ) , followed by h1n1 ( 78 % ) , human influenza ( 61 % ) and pandemic influenza ( 35 % ) .
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	logistic regression analyses identified 11 factors that significantly predicted a high level of knowledge about influenza .
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	six or more years of education completed [ odds ratio ( or ) 6.89 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 3.58 - 13.24 ) ] and recent participation in an influenza prevention activity [ or 5.27 ( 95 % ci 2.78 - 9.98 ) ]
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	were the strongest predictors .
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	recommendations to aid public health efforts toward pandemic mitigation and prevention include increasing accessibility of education options for migrants and increasing frequency and accessibility of influenza prevention activities , such as community outreach and meetings .
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	future research should seek to identify which influenza prevention activities and education materials are most effective .
54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819	during inflammation , cell surface adhesion molecules guide the adhesion and migration of circulating leukocytes across the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels to access the site of injury .
54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819	the transmembrane molecule cd13 is expressed on monocytes and endothelial cells and has been shown to mediate homotypic cell adhesion , which may imply a role for cd13 in inflammatory monocyte trafficking .
54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819	here , we show that ligation and clustering of cd13 by mab or viral ligands potently induce myeloid cell / endothelial adhesion in a signal transduction - dependent manner involving monocytic cytoskeletal rearrangement and filopodia formation .

54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819	this cd13-dependent adhesion , and cd13 molecules from monocytic and endothelial cells are present in the same immunocomplex , suggesting a direct participation of cd13 in the adhesive interaction .
54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819	this concept is strengthened by the fact that activated monocytic cells adhere to immobilized recombinant cd13 .
54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819	furthermore , treatment with anti - cd13 antibodies in a murine model of peritonitis results in a decrease in leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneum , suggesting a potential role for cd13 in leukocyte trafficking in vivo .
54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819	therefore , this work supports a new direction for cd13 biology , where these cell surface molecules act as true molecular interfaces that induce and participate in critical inflammatory cell interactions .

6cba6c30e1f246ada356df19cd8b8c392e62b053	if pathogens manage to cross the bbb and establish infection within the cns , the bbb can open in a regulated manner to allow leukocyte transmigration into the cns so that microbes , infected cells , and debris can be cleared .
6cba6c30e1f246ada356df19cd8b8c392e62b053	this review highlights how different inflammatory cytokines or signaling pathways disrupt or enhance bbb integrity in a way that regulates entry of neurotropic viruses into the cns .

739d5fab636ec8d0c532cc74d9a81386e87c406c	in all cohort , physical activity was significantly decreased ( p = 0.004 ) .
739d5fab636ec8d0c532cc74d9a81386e87c406c	however , analyzing the data according gender difference , males significantly decreased physical activity as well as females in which there was only a trend without reaching statistical significance ( 53.5 % vs 25.6 % ; p = 0.015 and 50.0 % vs 35.9 % , p = 0.106 ; in males and females , respectively ) .
739d5fab636ec8d0c532cc74d9a81386e87c406c	in addition , smart working activity resulted in a significant worsening of sq , particularly in males ( p < 0.001 ) .

30e953751fe8158705903e4cf1548bb4fda4a3f1	we here investigated the geographical expansion of the infection and correlate it with the annual indexes of air quality observed from the sentinel-5 satellite orbiting around china , italy and the u.s.a. controlling for population size , we find more viral infections in those areas afflicted by carbon monoxide ( co ) and nitrogen dioxide ( no2 ) .
30e953751fe8158705903e4cf1548bb4fda4a3f1	higher mortality was also correlated with poor air quality , namely with high pm2.5 , co and no2 values .
30e953751fe8158705903e4cf1548bb4fda4a3f1	in italy , the correspondence between poor air quality and sars - cov-2 appearance and induced mortality was the starkest .
30e953751fe8158705903e4cf1548bb4fda4a3f1	similar to smoking , people living in polluted areas are more vulnerable to sars - cov-2 infections and induced mortality .
30e953751fe8158705903e4cf1548bb4fda4a3f1	this further suggests the detrimental impact of climate change on the prevention of epidemics .

6bfd2809e31c992d160d33b11111f8cebda23876	these results showed that dcr3 levels were higher in sepsis group than control .
6bfd2809e31c992d160d33b11111f8cebda23876	dcr3 mrna and protein levels in huvecs were increased following treatment with lps , lta and zymosan , and also increased in jurkat cells treated by lps , but not by lta or zymosan .
6bfd2809e31c992d160d33b11111f8cebda23876	when huvecs were treated with the nf - κb inhibitor pdtc , dcr3 expression was decreased compared with controls .
6bfd2809e31c992d160d33b11111f8cebda23876	however , sp600125 and sb203580 had no effect on dcr3 mrna or protein levels .
6bfd2809e31c992d160d33b11111f8cebda23876	the results indicated that dcr3 secretion proceeded through the nf - κb signalling pathway in huvecs .

1c995ac4ae70bbcc5da53211e20df4398d1ce55d	however , a better knowledge of molecular mechanisms contributing to liver damage is required , and it is unknown whether the rhdv induces liver autophagy and how it relates to apoptosis .
1c995ac4ae70bbcc5da53211e20df4398d1ce55d	in this study , we attempted to explore which signalling pathways were involved in the autophagic response induced by the rhdv and to characterize their role in the context of rhdv pathogenesis .

1c995ac4ae70bbcc5da53211e20df4398d1ce55d	phosphorylation of mtor also augmented in early periods of infection and there was an increase in the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones bip / grp78 , chop and grp94 .
1c995ac4ae70bbcc5da53211e20df4398d1ce55d	apoptosis , measured as caspase-3 activity and expression of parp-1 , increased significantly at 30 and 36 hpi in parallel to the maximal expression of the rhdv capsid protein vp60 .
1c995ac4ae70bbcc5da53211e20df4398d1ce55d	these data indicate that rhdv infection initiates a rapid autophagic response , perhaps in an attempt to protect liver , which associates to er stress development and is independent from downregulation of the major autophagy suppressor mtor .

81f223866bd4b867bb3526d902da971287ad7de7	sera from sars patients at phase ii/ phase iii could mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity against some a549 cells and hpec .
81f223866bd4b867bb3526d902da971287ad7de7	it is concluded that some autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells would be developed after sars - cov infection and this phenomenon may indicate post - infectious cellular injury and also induce sars - induced immunopathology .

7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	the resulting neutropenia as well as injury to the pulmonary and gastrointestinal mucosa allow pathogenic micro - organisms easy access to the body .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	the symptoms of an incipient infection are usually subtle and limited to unexplained fever due to the absence of granulocytes .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	this is the reason why prompt administration of antimicrobial agents while waiting for the results of the blood cultures , the so - called empirical approach , became an undisputed standard of care .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	gram - negative pathogens remain the principal concern because their virulence accounts for serious morbidity and a high early mortality rate .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	three basic intravenous antibiotic regimens have evolved : initial therapy with a single antipseudomonal b - lactam , the so - called monotherapy ; a combination of two drugs : a b - lactam with an aminoglycoside , a second b - lactam or a quinolone ; and , thirdly , a glycopeptide in addition to b - lactam monotherapy or combination .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	as there is no single consistently superior empirical regimen , one should consider the local antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates in the selection of the initial antibiotic regimen .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	not all febrile neutropenic patients carry the same risk as those with fever only generally respond rapidly , whereas those with a clinically or microbiologically documented infection show a much slower reaction and less favorable response rate .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	once an empirical antibiotic therapy has been started , the patient must be monitored continuously for nonresponse , emergence of secondary infections , adverse effects , and the development of drug - resistant organisms .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	the average duration of fever in serious infections in eventually successfully treated neutropenic patients is 4 - 5 days .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	adaptations of an antibiotic regimen in a patient who is clearly not responding is relatively straightforward when a micro - organism has been isolated ; the results of the cultures , supplemented by susceptibility testing , will assist in selecting the proper antibiotics .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	the management of febrile patients with pulmonary infiltrates is complex .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	bronchoscopy and a high resolution computer - assisted tomographic scan represent the cornerstones of all diagnostic procedures , supplemented by serological tests for relevant viral pathogens and for aspergillosis .

7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	antibiotic treatment is usually continued for a minimum of 7 days or until culture results indicate that the causative organism has been eradicated and the patient is free of major signs and symptoms .
7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	if a persistently neutropenic patient has no complaints and displays no evidence of infection , early watchful cessation of antibiotic therapy or a change to the oral regimen should be considered .

2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	background :
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	direct immunofluorescence assays ( dfa ) are a rapid and inexpensive method for the detection of respiratory viruses and may therefore be used for surveillance .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	few epidemiological studies have been published based solely on dfa and none included respiratory picornaviruses and human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	we wished to evaluate the use of dfa for epidemiological studies with a long - term observation of respiratory viruses that includes both respiratory picornaviruses and hmpv .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	methods :
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	since 1998 all children hospitalized with respiratory illness at the university hospital bern have been screened with dfa for common respiratory viruses including adenovirus , respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , influenza a and b , and parainfluenza virus 1 - 3 .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	in 2006 assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hmpv were added .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	here we describe the epidemiological pattern for these respiratory viruses detected by dfa in 10'629 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 8'285 patients during a 12-year period ( 1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010 ) .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	results : addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hmpv
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	raised the proportion of positive dfa results from 35 % to 58 % ( p < 0.0001 ) .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	respiratory picornaviruses were the most common viruses detected among patients ≥1 year old .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	the seasonal patterns and age distribution for the studied viruses agreed well with those reported in the literature .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	in 2010 , an hmpv epidemic of unexpected size was observed .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	conclusions : dfa is a valid , rapid , flexible and inexpensive method .
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	the addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hmpv broadens its range of viral detection .

67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2	porcine deltacoronavirus ( pdcov ) , first identified in 2012 , is a swine enteropathogen now found in many countries .
67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2	the nucleocapsid ( n ) protein , a core component of pdcov , is essential for virus replication and is a significant candidate in the development of diagnostics for pdcov.
67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2	in this study , monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) were generated and tested for reactivity with three truncations of the full protein ( n1 , n2 , n3 ) that contained partial overlaps ; of the five monoclonals chosen tested , each reacted with only the n3 truncation .
67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2	the antibody designated 4e88 had highest binding affinity with the n protein and was chosen for in - depth examination .

67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2	homology analysis showed that the ep-4e88 sequence is highly conserved among pdcov strains , and also shares high similarity with sparrow coronavirus ( hku17 ) , asian leopard cat coronavirus ( alccov ) , quail coronavirus ( uae - hku30 ) , and sparrow deltacoronavirus ( spdcov ) .
67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2	of note , the pdcov ep-4e88 sequence shared very low similarity ( < 22.2 % ) with other porcine coronaviruses ( pedv , tgev , prcv , sads - cov , phev ) , demonstrating that it is an epitope that can be used for distinguishing pdcov and other porcine coronavirus .
67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2	3d structural analysis revealed that amino acids of ep-4e88 were in close proximity and may be exposed on the surface of the n protein .

411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	in australia , the 2009 epidemic of influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 resulted in increased admissions to intensive care .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	the annual contribution of influenza to use of intensive care is difficult to estimate , as many people with influenza present without a classic influenza syndrome and laboratory testing may not be performed .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	we used a population - based approach to estimate and compare the impact of recent epidemics of seasonal and pandemic influenza .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	methods :
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	for 2007 to 2010 , time series describing health outcomes in various population groups were prepared from a database of all intensive care unit ( icu ) admissions in the state of new south wales , australia .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	the serfling approach , a time series method , was used to estimate seasonal patterns in health outcomes in the absence of influenza epidemics .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	the contribution of influenza was estimated by subtracting expected seasonal use from observed use during each epidemic period .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	results :
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	the estimated excess rate of influenza - associated respiratory icu admissions per 100,000 inhabitants was more than three times higher in 2007
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	( 2.6/100,000 , 95 % ci 2.0 to 3.1 ) than the pandemic year , 2009 ( 0.76/100,000 , 95 % ci 0.04 to 1.48 ) .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	in 2009 , the highest excess respiratory icu admission rate was in 17 to 64 year olds ( 2.9/ 100,000 , 95 % ci 2.2 to 3.6 ) , while in 2007 , the highest excess rate was in those aged 65 years or older ( 9.5/100,000 , 95 % ci 6.2 to 12.8 ) .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	in 2009 , the excess rate was 17/100,000 ( 95 % ci 14 to 20 ) in aboriginal people and 14/100,000
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	( 95 % ci 13 to 16 ) in pregnant women .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	conclusion :
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	while influenza was diagnosed more frequently and peak use of intensive care was higher during the epidemic of pandemic influenza in 2009 , overall excess admissions to intensive care for respiratory illness was much greater during the influenza season in 2007 .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	thus , the impact of seasonal influenza on intensive care use may have previously been under - recognised .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	in 2009 , high icu use among young to middle aged adults was offset by relatively low use among older adults , and aboriginal people and pregnant women were substantially over - represented in icus .
411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	greater emphasis on prevention of serious illness in aboriginal people and pregnant women should be a priority in pandemic planning .

d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	three extraction methods were tested , that is , the magna pure lc tm , the cobas ampliprep tm , and the magna pure 96 tm with 10-fold dilutions of an influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 sample .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	two hundred thirty - nine respiratory specimens , 35 throat swabs , 164 nasopharyngeal specimens , and 40 broncho - alveolar fluids , were extracted with the magna pure 96 tm and the cobas ampliprep tm instruments .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	forty cobas ampliprep tm positive samples were also tested .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	realtime pcrs were used to identify influenza a and influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 , rhinovirus , enterovirus , adenovirus , varicella zoster virus , cytomegalovirus , and herpes simplex virus .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	similar results were obtained on rna extracted from dilutions of influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 with the three systems : the magna pure lc tm , the cobas ampliprep tm , and the magna pure 96 tm .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	data from clinical respiratory specimens extracted with the magna pure 96 tm and cobas ampliprep tm instruments were in 98.5 % in agreement ( p < 0.0001 ) for influenza a and influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	data for rhinovirus were in 97.3 % agreement ( p < 0.0001 ) and in 96.8 % agreement for enterovirus .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	they were in 100 % agreement for adenovirus .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	data for cytomegalovirus and hsv1 - 2 were in 95.2 % agreement ( p < 0.0001 ) .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	the magna pure 96 tm instrument is easy - to - use , reliable , and has a high throughput for extracting total nucleic acid from respiratory specimens .
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	these extracts are suitable for molecular diagnosis with any type of real - time pcr assay .
2b3b9a9d31a45e4e69cfbc4b01068fc567fc671f	this paper examines the trajectory of witnessing and testimony through modernity , utilizing the notion of ' technologies of trauma ' .
2b3b9a9d31a45e4e69cfbc4b01068fc567fc671f	such a notion acknowledges humanity 's reliance on technologies to transmute history , trauma , or memory , transforming technologies from medium and machine into artefacts for circulation and exchange .
2b3b9a9d31a45e4e69cfbc4b01068fc567fc671f	the transcendence of medium into artefacts as sites of trauma equally highlights the sociopolitical frames within which testimony is extracted and witnessing is enacted , unleashing trauma as a cultural form and a resonant genre of popular consumption .
2b3b9a9d31a45e4e69cfbc4b01068fc567fc671f	this paper , in tracing the trajectory of these technologies of trauma and its cultural turn from the sensorial to mass witnessing to the aesthetic regimes of immediacy in the digital age , comes to term with our machinic bind in releasing trauma and its aestheticization as a cultural artefact and the unethical challenges , which unfold in such a proposition .
2b3b9a9d31a45e4e69cfbc4b01068fc567fc671f	the development of print , photography , television , and digital platforms as technologies of trauma reiterates the popularization of trauma , witnessing and testimony as cultural forms reiterating how these are intimately implicated in our emergence as active consuming communities of trauma and in tandem how these remake us as vulnerable subjects through the circulation of trauma as a cultural form .
2b239fe6cdaea749fbfd5c219b70ceb99ba5a844	we developed a system for rapid determination of viral rna sequences whereby genomic sequence is obtained from cultured virus isolates without subcloning into plasmid vectors .
2b239fe6cdaea749fbfd5c219b70ceb99ba5a844	this method affords new opportunities to address the challenges of unknown or untypeable emerging viruses .

2407834245c872e91a78cdb9bd63ac8f81a49231	it remains unknown whether cqr reduces high fat diet ( hfd)-induced obesity and inflammation in rats .
2407834245c872e91a78cdb9bd63ac8f81a49231	in the current study , 46 male wistar rats were divided into two groups , one of which was fed a normal diet ( nd , 5.4 % fat , w / w ) and one of which was fed a hfd ( 45 % fat , w / w ) for 3 weeks .
2407834245c872e91a78cdb9bd63ac8f81a49231	following removal of the 12 most obesity - resistant rats from the hfd group , the remaining rats were divided into two sub - groups : a hfd group and a hfd+cqr group ( administered 120 mg / kg / day resveratrol and 240 mg / kg / day quercetin ) .
2407834245c872e91a78cdb9bd63ac8f81a49231	the results revealed that the hfd+cqr group had significantly lower body weights at 11 weeks compared with the hfd group and had significantly reduced visceral adipose tissue weights and adipocyte sizes .
2407834245c872e91a78cdb9bd63ac8f81a49231	serum lipid profiles were also significantly ameliorated in the hfd+cqr group .

7d19924d711c80a4c62a0289bf30dff5f44b8c35	it is however very difficult to identify non - compliance through survey research because claiming to follow the rules is socially desirable .
7d19924d711c80a4c62a0289bf30dff5f44b8c35	using three survey experiments , we examine the efficacy of different ' face - saving ' questions that aim to reduce social desirability in the measurement of compliance with public health measures .
7d19924d711c80a4c62a0289bf30dff5f44b8c35	our treatments soften the social norm of compliance by way of a short preamble in combination with a guilty - free answer choice making it easier for respondents to admit non - compliance .

44557db9dce19a72a599007f5a5c00ac8e031a79	on average , ml is more accurate than human classifiers , across a variety of training and test datasets , and across evaluation panels .
44557db9dce19a72a599007f5a5c00ac8e031a79	ml classifiers trained on different training sets are also more reliable than human classifiers , meaning that different ml classifiers are more consistent in assigning the same classifications to any given abstract , compared to different human classifiers .
44557db9dce19a72a599007f5a5c00ac8e031a79	while the top five percentile of human classifiers can outperform ml in limited cases , selection and training of such classifiers is likely costly and difficult compared to training ml models .
44557db9dce19a72a599007f5a5c00ac8e031a79	our results suggest ml models are a cost effective and highly accurate method for addressing problems in comparative bibliometric analysis , such as harmonising the discipline classifications of research from different funding agencies or countries .

3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	background :
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	the current study explored the prevalence of depressed mood among chinese undergraduate students and examined the coping patterns and degree of flexibility of flexibility of such patterns associated with such mood .
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	methods :
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	a set of questionnaire assessing coping patterns , coping flexibility , and depressive symptoms were administered to 428 students ( 234 men and 194 women ) .
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	results :
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	a total of 266 participants both completed the entire set of questionnaires and reported a frequency of two or more stressful life events
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	( the criterion needed to calculate variance in perceived controllability ) .
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	findings showed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher levels of both event frequency ( r
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	= .368 , p < .001 ) and event impact
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	( r = .245 , p < .001 ) and lower levels of perceived controllability ( r

3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	conclusions :
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	findings indicate that chinese university students with depressive symptoms reported experiencing a greater number of negative events than did non - depressed university students .
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	in addition , undergraduates with depressive symptoms were more likely than other undergraduates to utilize maladaptive coping methods .
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	such findings highlight the potential importance of interventions aimed at helping undergraduate students with a lower coping flexibility develop skills to cope with stressful life events .

31b036bd6ae0cfd30574b1b7aa39d7e9f35d8c86	by definition , supplements do not exert therapeutic actions , although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds .
31b036bd6ae0cfd30574b1b7aa39d7e9f35d8c86	for most supplements , little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in dmd as well as their preventing actions against infections .
31b036bd6ae0cfd30574b1b7aa39d7e9f35d8c86	often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients / caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team .
31b036bd6ae0cfd30574b1b7aa39d7e9f35d8c86	then , little is known about the real extent of supplement use in dmd patients .
31b036bd6ae0cfd30574b1b7aa39d7e9f35d8c86	it is mistakenly assumed that , since compounds are of natural origin , if a supplement is not effective , it will also do no harm .
31b036bd6ae0cfd30574b1b7aa39d7e9f35d8c86	however , supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions , in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity , with other therapies .
31b036bd6ae0cfd30574b1b7aa39d7e9f35d8c86	it is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients .

d9295ce0c9db088d9d8b35855016becbad9865c8	in this paper , we discuss the mechanisation of some fundamental propositional modal model theory .
d9295ce0c9db088d9d8b35855016becbad9865c8	the focus on models is novel : previous work in mechanisations of modal logic have centered on proof systems and applications in model - checking .
d9295ce0c9db088d9d8b35855016becbad9865c8	we have mechanised a number of fundamental results from the first two chapters of a standard textbook ( blackburn et al .

3e8c8e7704892bc4afc45e9801d515baac8f045a	renal replacement therapy in malaysia has shown exponential growth since 1990 .
3e8c8e7704892bc4afc45e9801d515baac8f045a	the dialysis acceptance rate for 2003 was 80 per million population , prevalence 391 per million population .
3e8c8e7704892bc4afc45e9801d515baac8f045a	there are now more than 10,000 patients on dialysis .
3e8c8e7704892bc4afc45e9801d515baac8f045a	this growth is proportional to the growth in gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
3e8c8e7704892bc4afc45e9801d515baac8f045a	improvement in nephrology and urology services with widespread availability of ultrasonography and renal pathology has improved care of renal patients .
3e8c8e7704892bc4afc45e9801d515baac8f045a	proper management of renal stone disease , lupus nephritis , and acute renal failure has decreased these as causes of end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) in younger age groups .

39683dd78bcf6b301cbed610b6e3213a5ce33380	, an algae - derived lectin , is one of the most potent viral entry inhibitors discovered to date .
39683dd78bcf6b301cbed610b6e3213a5ce33380	it is currently being developed as a microbicide with broad - spectrum activity against several enveloped viruses .
39683dd78bcf6b301cbed610b6e3213a5ce33380	grft can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection at picomolar concentrations , surpassing the ability of most anti - hiv agents .
39683dd78bcf6b301cbed610b6e3213a5ce33380	the potential to inhibit other viruses as well as parasites has also been demonstrated .
39683dd78bcf6b301cbed610b6e3213a5ce33380	griffithsin 's antiviral activity stems from its ability to bind terminal mannoses present in high - mannose oligosaccharides and crosslink these glycans on the surface of the viral envelope glycoproteins .
39683dd78bcf6b301cbed610b6e3213a5ce33380	here , we review structural and biochemical studies that established mode of action and facilitated construction of grft analogs , mechanisms that may lead to resistance , and in vitro and pre - clinical results that support the therapeutic potential of this lectin .

423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	over evolutionary time , pathogen challenge shapes the immune phenotype of the host to better respond to an incipient threat .
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	the extent and direction of this selection pressure depend on the local pathogen composition , which is in turn determined by biotic and abiotic features of the environment .
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	however , little is known about adaptation to local pathogen threats in wild animals .
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	the gentoo penguin ( pygoscelis papua ) is a species complex that lends itself to the study of immune adaptation because of its circumpolar distribution over a large latitudinal range , with little or no admixture between different clades .
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	in this study , we examine the diversity in a key family of innate immune genes - the toll - like receptors ( tlrs)-across the range of the gentoo penguin .
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	the three tlrs that we investigated present varying levels of diversity , with tlr4 and tlr5 greatly exceeding the diversity of tlr7 .
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	we present evidence of positive selection in tlr4 and tlr5 , which points to pathogen - driven adaptation to the local pathogen milieu .
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	finally , we demonstrate that two positively selected cosegregating sites in tlr5 are sufficient to alter the responsiveness of the receptor to its bacterial ligand , flagellin .
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	taken together , these results suggest that gentoo penguins have experienced distinct pathogen - driven selection pressures in different environments , which may be important given the role of the gentoo penguin as a sentinel species in some of the world 's most rapidly changing environments .
fdd8dfcb3e862e5afe92461ba75d02f4ac5e94e4	gene transfer to airway epithelia with amphotropic pseudotyped retroviral vectors is inefficient following apical vector application .
fdd8dfcb3e862e5afe92461ba75d02f4ac5e94e4	to better understand this inefficiency , we localized the expression of pit2 , the amphotropic receptor , in polarized human airway epithelia .
fdd8dfcb3e862e5afe92461ba75d02f4ac5e94e4	pit2 was expressed on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cells , suggesting that factors other than receptor abundance may limit apical gene transfer efficiency .
fdd8dfcb3e862e5afe92461ba75d02f4ac5e94e4	binding studies performed with radiolabeled amphotropic mulv suggested that the apically applied virus binds to pit2 .
fdd8dfcb3e862e5afe92461ba75d02f4ac5e94e4	hypothetical barriers to retroviral gene transfer include the apical glycocalyx and other secreted products of epithelia .
fdd8dfcb3e862e5afe92461ba75d02f4ac5e94e4	in this study , we demonstrated that sialic acid , keratan sulfate and collagen type v are present on the apical surface of well - differentiated human airway epithelia .

7d3433e24237e0921a0649b601d71a346ac42f3f	it remains unclear at this point to what extent chronic liver diseases should be considered as risk factors , due to a shortage of appropriate studies .
7d3433e24237e0921a0649b601d71a346ac42f3f	however , patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of covid-19 .
7d3433e24237e0921a0649b601d71a346ac42f3f	in addition , the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention .
7d3433e24237e0921a0649b601d71a346ac42f3f	thus , the challenge hepatologists are facing is to promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting , prioritise outpatient contacts , avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers , and at the same time maintain standard care for patients who require immediate medical attention .

c6518c58374cc315647f2873a234cfa983746bfd	by narrowing the focus to longer stretches of n - calls revealed by sprofiler , conventional sequencing was able to identify unique insertions and point mutations .
c6518c58374cc315647f2873a234cfa983746bfd	shorter n - calls also harboured point mutations , but the absence of deletions among n - calls suggests that probe confirmation affects binding and thus n - calling .
c6518c58374cc315647f2873a234cfa983746bfd	this study supports the contention that the gseq is more capable of assigning bases when used in conjunction with sprofiler .

df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	( tnf- ␣ )
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	has been shown to play a role in many inflammatory conditions .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	currently anti - tnf- ␣ drugs ( e.g. etanercept ) are used in humans for treatment of autoimmune diseases .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	in this study we aimed to elucidate the role of tnf- ␣ in the development of virus - endotoxin - induced respiratory disease .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	twenty - two caesarean derived colostrum deprived pigs were used .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	initially , the availability in the lungs and circulation , and possible clinical and inflammatory effects of etanercept alone were assessed in 4 pigs after intratracheal and intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 mg / per route / per pig .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	high anti - tnf- ␣ activity was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) fluids , peritoneal lavage fluids and serum of all animals for at least 8 h post - inoculation ( hpi ) .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	no clinical symptoms , lung lesions , lung cell infiltration or induction of ifn- ␣ , il-1 , il-6 , il-12 and tnf- ␣ in bal were detected .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	subsequently , the ability of etanercept to block porcine tnf- ␣ and its effect on the above mentioned parameters and on lung virus titres were assessed in 8 pigs .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	they were inoculated intratracheally with porcine respiratory coronavirus ( prcv ) followed by lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) 24 h later .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	etanercept was administered at the time of lps inoculation via the same routes and dose as in the initial experiment .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	the parameters were compared with a control group ( n = 8) , receiving only prcv - lps .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	half of the animals from each group were euthanized at 4 and the rest at 8 h after lps inoculation .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	tnf- ␣ was completely neutralized in 3 of the 4 animals euthanized at 4 hpi and significantly lower than in the prcv - lps group at all times .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	no significant differences in disease severity , lung lesions , virus replication , lung cell infiltration or levels of ifn- ␣ , il-1 , il-6 and il-12 / il-23 were observed between the two groups .
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	blocking of tnf- ␣ alone was not sufficient to ameliorate disease in the prcv - lps model of respiratory disease , possibly due to the redundancy in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade , or the involvement of other unidentified disease mediators .

23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	method :
23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group ( n = 30 ) and control group ( n = 30 ) .
23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	the lung window was reconstructed by karl 3d iterative technique in the study group .
23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	the image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double - blind method .
23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	the value of ct measurement and its standard deviation ( sd ) was used as an objective evaluation criteria .
23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	the volume of ct dose index ( ctdi vol ) , dose length product ( dlp ) and effective dose ( ed ) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically .
23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	result : there was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities , consolidation , crazypaving pattern , fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group ( p > 0.05 ) .
23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	in addition , no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level ( sd ) between the two groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	however , significant differences was found in ctdi vol , dlp , and ed between the study group and the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .

76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system ( cns ) and the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	environmental and infectious factors had been strongly associated and involved in the increased occurrence of ms , to more than twice , in the last 10 years .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	in this review , we describe the main findings on the relationship between viral and bacterial infections and the onset and progression of ms .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	methods :
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	the research involved a systematic review of scientific literature regarding infection and ms .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	our search was performed using and consulting specialized websites like pubmed , medline and cochrane .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	the keywords ( mesh terms ) employed for the digital search were : " virus , bacteria , autoimmune disease of the nervous system , and multiple sclerosis . "
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	articles published in english indexed journals during the past 15 years were used for the study .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	results :
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	epidemiological studies suggest that ms has an infectious etiologic component causing an inflammatory process that may contribute to the initiation and/or exacerbation of the disease .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	particularly , viral infections and demyelination events in the cns may be due to the penetration of viruses such as the epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) through the bloodstream to the cns , specifically .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	on the other hand , chronic bacterial infections may cause demyelination processes that trigger or increase the complications of the disease in ms .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	conclusions :
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	this study shows the multiple factors involved in the occurrence of ms .
76ac3e143a778ec5428feb84fa904f254d433d1b	more epidemiological studies are necessary to support the relationship and involvement of viral and bacterial infections in the onset , development and severity of the disease .

50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	high oxygen tension in blood and/or tissue affects clinical outcomes in several diseases .
50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	thus , the optimal target pao 2 for patients recovering from cardiac arrest ( ca ) has been extensively examined .
50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	many patients develop hypoxic brain injury after the return of spontaneous circulation ( rosc ) ; this supports the need for oxygen administration in patients after ca .
50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	insufficient oxygen delivery due to decreased blood flow to cerebral tissue during ca results in hypoxic brain injury .
50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	by contrast , hyperoxia may increase dissolved oxygen in the blood and , subsequently , generate reactive oxygen species that are harmful to neuronal cells .
50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	this secondary brain injury is particularly concerning .
50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	although several clinical studies demonstrated that hyperoxia during post - ca care was associated with poor neurological outcomes , considerable debate is ongoing because of inconsistent results .
50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	potential reasons for the conflicting results include differences in the definition of hyperoxia , the timing of exposure to hyperoxia , and pao 2 values used in analyses .

ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	rna interference ( rnai ) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of gene silencing induced by double - stranded rnas ( dsrnas ) .
ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	among the widely used dsrnas , small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) and short hairpin rnas have evolved as extremely powerful and the most popular gene silencing reagents .
ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	the key challenge to achieving effi cient gene silencing especially for the purpose of therapeutics is mainly dependent on the effectiveness and specifi city of the selected rnai - targeted sequences .
ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	practically , only a small number of dsrnas are capable of inducing highly effective and sequence - specifi c gene silencing via rnai mechanism .
ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	in addition , the effi ciency of gene silencing induced by dsrnas can only be experimentally examined based on inhibition of the target gene expression .
ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	therefore , it is essential to develop a fully robust and comparative validation system for measuring the effi cacy of designed dsrnas .

ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	the effi ciency of sirnas is determined by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporters with easily quantifi ed readouts including enhanced green fl uorescence protein and fi refl y luciferase .
ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	since only a readily available short synthetic dna fragment is needed for constructing this reliable and effi cient reporter - based sirna

79e85d2029542868cf5a548da396005576cf4e1b	we identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime following the ostwald growth , where , over the course of time , one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in crystallization of proteins .
79e85d2029542868cf5a548da396005576cf4e1b	we introduce the s factor which provides a quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment policy , which is very helpful not only to monitor the covid-19 pandemic spread but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy .
79e85d2029542868cf5a548da396005576cf4e1b	the results show that a policy based on joint confinement , targeted tests , and tracking positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy ; in fact , we found values of 9 , 5 , and 31 for the success s factor for china , south korea , and italy , respectively , where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment policy .

c754ce4a15d6efa184842b77848e34d04445e209	this paper presents many types of interplays between parasites and the host , showing the history of parasites , the effects of parasites on the outcome of wars , invasions , migrations , and on the development of numerous regions of the globe , and the impact of parasitic diseases on the society and on the course of human evolution .
c754ce4a15d6efa184842b77848e34d04445e209	it also emphasizes the pressing need to change the look at the parasitism phenomenon , proposing that the term " cohabitant " is more accurate than parasite , because every living being , from bacteria to mammals , is a consortium of living beings in the pangenome .
c754ce4a15d6efa184842b77848e34d04445e209	even the term parasitology should be replaced by cohabitology because there is no parasite alone and host alone : both together compose a new adaptive system : the parasitized - host or the cohabitant - cohabited being .
c754ce4a15d6efa184842b77848e34d04445e209	it also suggests switching the old paradigm based on attrition and destruction , to a new one founded on adaptation and living together .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	covid-19 has affected people 's lives all over the world .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	it has created a perplexing situation about what actions one should and should not take .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	mathematical modeling of biological systems is challenging and gives a different perspective , especially in decision making under multiple complex scenarios .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	public health officials grapple with multiple issues such as recommending a lockdown , contact tracing , promoting the mask usage , social distancing , and frequent handwashing , as well as keeping the families of patients in isolation for the incubation period .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	it is even more challenging to find the optimal combination of all of the above without the use of a suitable mathematical model .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	there are many different approaches to modeling the spread of sars - cov-2 , the virus that causes covid-19 .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	some models are easy to use , while others need extensive use of highend computers .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	however , models to assist public health official 's decision making are hard to find .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	in this paper , we discuss a novel systems approach to building a model for simulating the spread of covid-19 .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	the model , mimansa , divides an individual 's in - person social interactions into three areas , namely home , workplace , and public places .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	while tracking the in - person interactions , the model follows the virus spread .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	internally , the model labels healthy people who turn into silent carriers , virus - infected patients , or healthy carriers .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	it tracks down to the smallest level of a single day interaction .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	as and when a new silent carrier is created , the model automatically expands and builds a network of virus spread .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	all single - day blocks are integrated to get the final result .
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	mimansa is novel due to its ability to build a virus spread network as a multilevel , integrated model , and in the end , enable one to make complex decisions with ease .

12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	autophagy is an important survival pathway and participates in the host response to infection .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	beneficial effects of melatonin have been previously reported in an animal model of acute liver failure ( alf ) induced by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus ( rhdv ) .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	this study was aimed to investigate whether melatonin protection against liver injury induced by the rhdv associates to modulation of autophagy .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	rabbits were infected with 2 9 10 4 hemagglutination units of a rhdv isolate and received 20 mg / kg melatonin at 0 , 12 , and 24 hr postinfection .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	rhdv induced autophagy , with increased expression of beclin-1 , ubiquitin - like autophagy - related ( atg)5 , atg12 , atg16l1 and sequestrosome 1 ( p62 / sqstm1 ) , protein 1 light chain 3 ( lc3 ) staining , and conversion of lc3-i to autophagosome - associated lc3-ii .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	these effects reached a maximum at 24 hr postinfection , in parallel to extensive colocalization of lc3 and lysosome - associated membrane protein ( lamp)-1 .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	the autophagic response induced by rhdv infection was significantly inhibited by melatonin administration .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	melatonin treatment also resulted in decreased immunoreactivity for rhdv viral vp60 antigen and a significantly reduction in rhdv vp60 mrna levels , oxidized to reduced glutathione ratio ( gssg / gsh ) , caspase-3 activity , and immunoglobulin - heavy - chain - binding protein ( bip ) and ccaat / enhancer - binding protein homologous protein ( chop ) expression .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	results indicate that , in addition to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects , and the suppression of er stress , melatonin induces a decrease in autophagy associated with rhdv infection and inhibits rhdv rna replication .
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	results obtained reveal novel molecular pathways accounting for the protective effect of melatonin in this animal model of alf .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	enterovirus genome replication occurs at virus - induced structures derived from cellular membranes and lipids .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	however , the origin of these replication organelles ( ros ) remains uncertain .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	ultrastructural evidence of the membrane donor is lacking , suggesting that the sites of its transition into ros are rare or fleeting .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	to overcome this challenge , we combined live - cell imaging and serial block - face scanning electron microscopy of whole cells to capture emerging enterovirus ros .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	the first foci of fluorescently labeled viral protein correlated with ros connected to the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) and preceded the appearance of ros stemming from the trans - golgi network .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	whole - cell data sets further revealed striking contact regions between ros and lipid droplets that may represent a route for lipid shuttling to facilitate ro proliferation and genome replication .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	our data provide direct evidence that enteroviruses use er and then golgi membranes to initiate ro formation , demonstrating the remarkable flexibility with which enteroviruses usurp cellular organelles .

e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	to capture the emergence of enterovirus ros , we use correlative light and serial block - face scanning electron microscopy , a powerful method to pinpoint rare events in their whole - cell ultrastructural context .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	ro biogenesis was found to occur first at er and then at golgi membranes .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	extensive contacts were found between early ros and lipid droplets ( lds ) , which likely serve to provide ld - derived lipids required for replication .
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	together , these data establish the dual origin of enterovirus ros and the chronology of their biogenesis at different supporting cellular membranes .

446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	the death toll from the sars - cov-2 virus decreases very strongly with increasing intensity of the lockdown , but ( iii )
446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	the duration of the epidemic increases at first with that intensity and then decreases again , such that ( iv )
446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	it may be best to begin with selecting a lockdown intensity beyond the intensity that leads to the maximum duration ,
446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	( v ) an intermittent lockdown strategy should also work and might be more acceptable socially and economically , ( vi )
446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	an initially intensive but adaptive lockdown strategy should be most efficient , both in terms of its low number of casualties and shorter duration , ( vii )
446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	such an adaptive lockdown strategy offers the advantage of being robust to unexpected imports of the virus , e.g. due to international travel , ( viii )
446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	the eradication strategy may still be superior as it leads to even fewer deaths and a shorter period of economic downturn , but should have the adaptive strategy as backup in case of unexpected infection imports , ( ix )
446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	earlier detection of infections is the most effective way in which the epidemic can be controlled , whilst waiting for vaccines .

e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	in many outbreaks caused by viruses , the transmission of the agents can occur through contaminated environmental surfaces .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	because of the increasing incidence of viral infections , there is a need to evaluate novel engineering control methods for inactivation of viruses on surfaces .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	ultraviolet germicidal irradiation ( uvgi ) is considered a promising method to inactivate viruses .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	this study evaluated uvgi effectiveness for viruses on the surface of gelatin - based medium in a uv exposure chamber .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	the effects of uv dose , viral nucleic acid type ( single - stranded rna , ssrna ; single - stranded dna , ssdna ; double - stranded rna , dsrna ; and double - stranded dna , dsdna ) , and relative humidity on the virus survival fraction were investigated .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	for 90 % viral reduction , the uv dose was 1.32 to 3.20 mj / cm 2 for ssrna , 2.50 to to 4.47 mj / cm 2 for ssdna , 3.80 to 5.36 mj / cm 2 for dsrna , and 7.70 to 8.13 mj / cm 2 for dsdna .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	for all four tested viruses , the uv dose for 99 % viral reduction was 2 times higher than those for 90 % viral reduction .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	viruses on a surface with single - stranded nucleic acid ( ssrna and ssdna ) were more susceptible to uv inactivation than viruses with double - stranded nucleic acid ( dsrna and dsdna ) .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	for the same viral reduction , the uv dose at 85 % relative humidity ( rh ) was higher than that at 55 % rh .
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	in summary , results showed that uvgi was an effective method for inactivation of viruses on surfaces .

8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda	in recent years , many variants of percolation have been used to study network structure and the behavior of processes spreading on networks .
8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda	these include bond percolation , site percolation , k - core percolation , bootstrap percolation , the generalized epidemic process , and the watts threshold model ( wtm ) .
8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda	we show that - except for bond percolation - each of these processes arises as a special case of the wtm , and bond percolation arises from a small modification .
8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda	in fact " heterogeneous k - core percolation , " a corresponding " heterogeneous bootstrap percolation " model , and the generalized epidemic process are completely equivalent to one another and the wtm .
8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda	we further show that a natural generalization of the wtm in which individuals " transmit " or " send a message " to their neighbors with some probability less than 1 can be reformulated in terms of the wtm , and so this apparent generalization is in fact not more general .
8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda	finally , we show that in bond percolation , finding the set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution .
8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda	a consequence of these results is that mathematical techniques developed for the wtm apply to these other models as well , and techniques that were developed for some particular case may in fact apply much more generally .

39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	however , epidemiological information regarding bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many important cattle producing countries from south america .
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	in this study , three bovine norovirus genogroup iii sequences were determined by conventional rt - pcr and sanger sequencing in feces from diarrheic dairy calves from argentina
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	( b4836 , b4848 , and b4881 , all collected in 2012 ) .
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for the rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp , 503 nucleotides ) of these three samples suggested that two of them ( b4836 and b4881 ) belong to genotype 2
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	( giii.2 )
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	while the third one ( b4848 ) was more closely related to genotype 1 ( giii.1 ) strains .
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	by deep sequencing , the capsid region from two of these strains could be determined .
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	this confirmed the circulation of genotype 1
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	( b4848 ) together with the presence of another sequence ( b4881 ) sharing its highest genetic relatedness with genotype 1 , but sufficiently distant to constitute a new genotype .
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	this latter strain was shown in silico to be a recombinant : phylogenetic divergence was detected between its rna - dependent rna polymerase coding sequence ( genotype giii.2 ) and its capsid protein coding sequence ( genotype giii.1 or a potential norovirus genotype ) .
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	according to this data , this strain could be the second genotype giii.2_giii.1 bovine norovirus recombinant described in literature worldwide .
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	further analysis suggested that this strain could even be a potential norovirus giii genotype , tentatively named giii.4 .
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	the data provides important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in south america .

b1cc4c6d070470446f1dd22ad3eacbe55f69a0da	almost overnight , italian behavior analysts were faced with the challenge of setting up remotely whole - family systems aimed at maintaining adaptive skills and low levels of challenging behavior to be carried out solely by caregivers .
b1cc4c6d070470446f1dd22ad3eacbe55f69a0da	given these extraordinary circumstances , the protocols available from the applied behavioranalytic , parent training , and autism literature did not appear to fully meet the needs of parents having to be with their children under extreme levels of stress in a confined space with limited reinforcers for 24 hr a day , 7 days a week .
b1cc4c6d070470446f1dd22ad3eacbe55f69a0da	to meet this unprecedented challenge , we developed a dynamic and holistic protocol that extended to the full day and that recognized the need for sustainable intervention delivered solely by parents , who were often looking after more than one child .

58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	background : emergence and re - emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) in north america , asia and europe has caused severe economic loss to the global swine industry .
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	however , the virome of pedv infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown .
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	the advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host .
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	methods :
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	the objective of this study was to characterize the rna virome in pedv - positive pigs using the hypothesis - free metagenomics approach based on next - generation sequencing .
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	specifically , 217 pedv - positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 us states during 2015 - 2016 were analyzed .
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	results :
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	a kraken algorithm - based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different rna genera besides pedv ( alphacoronavirus genus ) , including mamastrovirus ( 52 % , 113/217 ) , enterovirus ( 39 % , 85/217 ) , sapelovirus ( 31 % , 67/217 ) , posavirus ( 30 % , 66/217 ) , kobuvirus ( 23 % , 49/217 ) , sapovirus ( 13 % , 28/217 ) , teschovirus ( 10 % , 22/217 ) , pasivirus ( 9 % , 20/217 ) , and deltacoronavirus ( 3 % , 6/217 ) .
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	there were 58 out of 217 piglets ( 27 % )
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	have pedv infection alone whereas the remaining 159 ( 73 % ) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses .
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	conclusion
58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	: these findings demonstrated that pedv infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive rna viral flora consisting of four different families : astroviridae , picornaviridae , caliciviridae , and coronaviridae .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	at early stages of the covid-19 pandemic which we are experiencing , the publicly reported incidence , mortality and case fatality rates ( cfr ) vary significantly between countries .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	here we aim to untangle factors that are associated with the differences during the first quarter of the year 2020 .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	number of performed covid-19 tests has a strong correlation with country - specific incidence ( p < 2 × 10 -16 ) and mortality rate ( p = 5.1 × 10 -8 ) .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	using multivariate linear regression we show that incidence and mortality rates correlate significantly with gdp per capita ( p = 2.6 × 10 -15 and 7.0 × 10 -4 , respectively ) , country - specific duration of the outbreak ( 2.6 × 10 -4 and 0.0019 ) , fraction of citizens over 65 years old ( p = 0.0049 and 3.8 × 10 -4 ) and level of press freedom ( p = 0.021 and 0.019 ) which cumulatively explain 80 % of variability of incidence and more than 60 % of variability of mortality of the disease during the period analyzed .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	country hemisphere demonstrated significant correlation only with mortality ( p = 0.17 and 0.036 ) whereas population density ( p = 0.94 and p = 0.75 ) and latitude ( p = 0.61 and 0.059 ) did not reach significance in our model .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	case fatality rate is shown to rise as the outbreak progresses ( p=0.028 ) .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	we rank countries by covid-19 mortality corrected for incidence and the factors that were shown to affect it , and by cfr corrected for outbreak duration , yielding very similar results .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	among the countries where the outbreak started after the 15th of february and with at least 1000 registered patients during the period analyzed , the lowest corrected cfr are seen in israel , south africa and chile .
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	the ranking results should be considered with caution as they do not consider all confounding factors or data reporting biases .
119a2f1357346c9a9b83d328b28a1c61e000c2b8	bacterial and epithelial cell samples were obtained , within 24 h of onset of pharyngeal symptoms , from the palatine tonsils of nine patients ( four female and five male ; age range 10 -40 years , median age 23 ) with acute tonsillitis , culture - positive for streptococcus pyogenes .
119a2f1357346c9a9b83d328b28a1c61e000c2b8	the specimens were examined using fluorescein isothiocyanate-(fitc ) and gold - labelled antiserum to s. pyogenes and fluorescence , scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy .
119a2f1357346c9a9b83d328b28a1c61e000c2b8	s. pyogenes could be identified both in the mucous layer covering the tonsils and attached to the surface epithelial cells .
119a2f1357346c9a9b83d328b28a1c61e000c2b8	long chains of coccus - shaped bacteria could be seen encroaching on the epithelial cell borders .
119a2f1357346c9a9b83d328b28a1c61e000c2b8	s. pyogenes can apparently penetrate the mucous barrier , attach to the epithelial cells , spread from cell to cell and possibly penetrate into the outermost layer of the epithelial cells .
119a2f1357346c9a9b83d328b28a1c61e000c2b8	these events in turn provoke cytokine production and/or complement activation , which induce inflammatory reaction in the tonsillar tissue .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( prrsv ) glycoprotein 4 ( gp4 ) resembles a typical type i membrane protein in its structure but lacks a hydrophilic tail at the c - terminus , suggesting that gp4 may be a lipid - anchored membrane protein .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	using the human decay - accelerating factor ( daf ; cd55 ) , a known glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) lipid - anchored protein , chimeric constructs were made to substitute the gpi - anchor domain of daf with the putative lipid - anchor domain of gp4 , and their membrane association and lipase cleavage were determined in cells .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	the daf - gp4 fusion protein was transported to the plasma membrane and was cleaved by phosphatidylinositol - specific phospholipase c ( pi - plc ) , indicating that the c - terminal domain of gp4 functions as a gpi anchor .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	mutational studies for residues adjacent to the gpi modification site and characterization of respective mutant viruses generated from infectious cdna clones show that the ability of gp4 for membrane association corresponded to virus viability and growth characteristics .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	the residues t158 ( ω − 2 , where ω is the gpi moiety at e160 ) , p159 ( ω − 1 ) , and m162 ( ω + 2 ) of gp4 were determined to be important for virus replication , with m162 being of particular importance for virus infectivity .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	the complete removal of the peptide - anchor domain in gp4 resulted in a complete loss of virus infectivity .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	the depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of cells reduced the virus production , suggesting a role of lipid rafts in prrsv infection .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	remarkably , gp4 was found to colocalize with cd163 in the lipid rafts on the plasma membrane .
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	since cd163 has been reported as a cellular receptor for prrsv and gp4 has been shown to interact with this receptor , our data implicates an important role of lipid rafts during entry of the virus .
135c2545aa4c09541973a73cb3fac25a9ef5779c	the covid-19 pandemic has made it imperative to rapidly implement changes to typical medical practice in order to minimise spread of the sars - cov-2 virus .

38321345afd0ea4ce0f50902b1944751e5ad243b	the expanded use of information technology in education has led to the emergence of technostress due to a lack of adaptation to the technological environment .
38321345afd0ea4ce0f50902b1944751e5ad243b	the purpose of this study is to identify the levels of technostress in primary and secondary education in 428 teachers using a red - tic questionnaire , of which skepticism , fatigue , anxiety , and inefficiency are the main components .
38321345afd0ea4ce0f50902b1944751e5ad243b	for the empirical analysis of the data , principal component analysis ( pca ) and confirmatory factor analysis ( cfa ) were used .
38321345afd0ea4ce0f50902b1944751e5ad243b	the results show that 12 % of chilean teachers participating in the study feel techno - fatigued , 13 % feel techno - anxious , and 11 % present both conditions .
38321345afd0ea4ce0f50902b1944751e5ad243b	male teachers show a higher incidence of techno - anxiety and techno - fatigue than their female peers .
38321345afd0ea4ce0f50902b1944751e5ad243b	it can be concluded that the questionnaire used is a reliable tool to evaluate the presence of technostress , and it manifests itself importantly in its components of techno - anxiety and techno - fatigue in chilean teachers .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	the causes of infections in pediatric populations differ between age groups and settings , particularly in the tropics .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	such differences in epidemiology may lead to misdiagnosis and ineffective empirical treatment .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	here , we investigated the current spectrum of pathogens causing febrile diseases leading to pediatric hospitalization in lambaréné , gabon .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	from august 2015 to march 2016 , we conducted a prospective , cross - sectional , hospital - based study in a provincial hospital .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	patients were children ≤ 15 years with fever ≥ 38 ° c and required hospitalization .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	a total of 600 febrile patients were enrolled .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	malaria was the main diagnosis found in 52 % ( 311/600 ) patients .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	blood cultures revealed septicemia in 3 % ( 17/593 ) , among them four cases of typhoid fever .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	the other causes of fever were heterogeneously distributed between both bacteria and viruses .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	severe infections identified by lambaréné organ dysfunction score ( lods ) were also most often caused by malaria , but children with danger signs did not have more coinfections than others .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	in 6 % ( 35/600 ) of patients , no pathogen was isolated .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	in gabon , malaria is still the major cause of fever in children , followed by a bacterial and viral disease .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	guidelines for both diagnosis and management should be tailored to the spectrum of pathogens and resources available locally .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	causes of fever in african pediatric populations are more diverse than previously thought .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	a landmark study conducted in tanzania showed that due to a change in epidemiology , a broad spectrum of pathogens replaced p. falciparum malaria as the most common cause of disease in children in this area 1 .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	however , a few years later , p. falciparum malaria , is still seen to be the main cause of febrile illnesses in ghana , west africa 2 .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	when unaware , these differences in epidemiology might lead to misdiagnosis as well as inefficient treatment by the medical personnel .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	the process of medical diagnosis includes the joint interpretation of symptoms , clinical signs and laboratory findings .
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	careful selection and prioritization of a diagnostic setup are informed by a priori knowledge of the seasonal , local and worldwide frequency and distribution of a given disease 3,4 .

b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	this study was performed to investigate the mechanism of action of ursolic acid in terms of anti - toxoplasma gondii effects , including immunomodulatory effects .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	we evaluated the anti - t. gondii effects of ursolic acid , and analyzed the production of nitric oxide ( no ) , reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , and cytokines through co - cultured immune cells , as well as the expression of intracellular organelles of t. gondii .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	the subcellular organelles and granules of t. gondii , particularly rhoptry protein 18 , microneme protein 8 , and inner membrane complex sub - compartment protein 3 , were markedly decreased when t. gondii was treated with ursolic acid , and their expressions were effectively inhibited .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	furthermore , ursolic acid effectively increased the production of no , ros , interleukin

b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	these results demonstrate that ursolic acid not only causes anti - t. gondii activity / action by effectively inhibiting the survival of t. gondii and the subcellular organelles of t. gondii , but also induces specific immunomodulatory effects in t. gondii - infected immune cells .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	therefore , this study indicates that ursolic acid can be effectively utilized as a potential candidate agent for developing novel anti - toxoplasmosis drugs , and has immunomodulatory activity .

b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	the protein kinases of t. gondii have been known to play key roles for modulating the motility , invasion , replication , egress , and survival within the host [ 5 ] .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	it was reported that t. gondii is divided through a unique form of cell division such as endodyogeny , and its chromosomal passenger complex is essential for the organization of a functional mitotic spindle [ 6 ] .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	furthermore , t. gondii not only forms a parasitophorous vacuole membrane ( pvm ) after invasion into host cells , but also proliferates and grows into a pvm [ 7 - 9 ] .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	for decades , several compounds through many researchers and groups were developed as drugs for treating toxoplasmosis , and are usefully used in clinics .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	however , existing drugs are widely vulnerable to drug - resistance in clinics globally .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	to overcome pharmacological barriers to these challenges , the efforts for treating infectious diseases have been attempted in various fields , and it has been reported that various extracts / compounds derived from medicinal plants and new synthetic compounds have anti - t. gondii effects in the in vitro and pre - clinic stages [ 10 ]

b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	in addition , it was reported that various extracts / compounds derived from plants and synthetic compounds could be used in the medical field as useful resources for treating acute or chronic infectious diseases caused by schistosomiasis , leishmania , malaria , or tuberculosis , as well as viral diseases including middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) or zika fever and avian influenza [ 16 ]

b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	in this context , various studies on the development or discovery of effective drugs and novel candidates against parasitic zoonosis are urgently required .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	in this regard , ursolic acid is a bioactive compound derived from medicinal plants , and is also known to have selective bioactive properties such as anti - inflammatory [ 24 - 27 ] and anticancer effects [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	it also effectively induces various activities , including antimicrobial [ 32 - 34 ] and anti - parasitic effects [ 35 , 36 ] .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	until recently , although studies and compounds regarding anti - t. gondii activity have been reported globally [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	[ 42 ] [ 43 ] , the mechanism of action of ursolic acid on the inhibitory effect of t. gondii and the immunomodulatory activity was not reported yet .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	from this perspective , this study was performed to evaluate the mechanism of action and the immunomodulatory activity of ursolic acid in terms of anti - t. gondii effects and activity , and to confirm the potential as a potent candidate drug for developing novel anti - toxoplasmosis agents .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	results t. gondii has a specific network structure and systems , including various intracellular organelles such as the mitochondrion , apicoplast , dense granule , and rhoptry ( figure 1 ) , which induces serious zoonotic diseases such as toxoplasmosis , particularly in humans , while causing infection in various vertebrates .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	before evaluating the mechanism of action of ursolic acid against t. gondii , we measured the inhibitory effect of ursolic acid ( ua ) against the survival of t. gondii and normal lung cells infected with t. gondii through an mtt assay as described previously [ 9 ] , which showed significant results and reproducibility .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	when t. gondii was treated with ua ( 12.5 - 400 µg / ml ) for 24 h , the viability was effectively inhibited , and the parasitic survival rate was measured as less than 30 % at 200 µg / ml. ua strongly decreased the viability of t. gondii compared with sulfadiazine ( sf ) , which demonstrates that ua caused anti - t. gondii effect or activity against t. gondi ( data not shown ) .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	in particular , the lung cells infected with t. gondii were markedly inhibited in a dose - dependent manner after treatment with ursolic acid ( 12.5 - 200 µg / ml )
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	when compared with the untreated infection cells and the t. gondii - infected cells treated with sf ( figure 2 ) .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	furthermore , it was clearly shown that there were significant differences between the untreated t. gondii - group and the experimental groups .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	in these aspects , it was demonstrated that ua effectively induced the selective anti - parasitic effect / action compared to the sf - treated group and the untreated group through a direct inhibitory effect on the pathogens 2019 , 8 ,

b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	this shows that ua has the potential to be utilized as an anti - t. gondii candidate agent and/or a synergic compound with the existing drugs for developing novel anti - toxoplasmosis agents .
b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	therefore , these results indicate that ua strongly inhibits or blocks the survival of t. gondii by effectively inducing anti - t. gondii activity through the selective inhibitory activity and/or action against the viability of t. gondii .

8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	methods :
8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	a survey was conducted during 2009 of 48 isolation facilities caring for patients with hids in 16 european countries .
8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	checklists and standard evaluation forms were used to collect and interpret data on hand hygiene , routine hygiene and disinfection , and waste management .

8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	forty percent of hids had no non - hand - operated sinks or alcohol - based antiseptic distributors , while 27 % did not have procedures for routine hygiene , final disinfection , or safe discarding of non - disposable objects or equipment .
8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	there was considerable variation in the management of waste and in the training of housekeeping personnel .
8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	euronhid has developed recommendations for hand hygiene , disinfection , routine hygiene , and waste management .
8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	conclusions :
8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	most aspects of hand hygiene , routine hygiene and disinfection , and waste management were considered at least partially adequate in the majority of european isolation facilities dedicated for the care of patients with hids .
8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	but considerable variability was observed , with management of waste and training of housekeeping personnel being generally less satisfactory .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	the situation of the covid-19 pandemic reminds us that we permanently need high - value flexible solutions to urgent clinical needs including simplified diagnostic technologies suitable for use in the field and for delivering targeted therapeutics .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	from our perspective nanotechnology is revealed as a vital resource for this , as a generic platform of technical solutions to tackle complex medical challenges .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	it is towards this perspective and focusing on nanomedicine that we take issue with prof park 's recent editorial published in the journal of controlled release .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	prof. park argued that in the last 15 years nanomedicine failed to deliver the promised innovative clinical solutions to the patients ( park ,

5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	we , the etpn ( european technology platform on nanomedicine ) [ 2 ] , respectfully disagree .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	in fact , the more than 50 formulations currently in the market , and the recent approval of 3 key nanomedicine products ( e. g. onpattro , hensify and vyxeos ) , have demonstrated that the nanomedicine field is concretely able to design products that overcome critical barriers in conventional medicine in a unique manner , but also to deliver within the cells new drug - free therapeutic effects by using pure physical modes of action , and therefore make a difference in patients lives .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	furthermore , the > 400 nanomedicine formulations currently in clinical trials are expecting to bring novel clinical solutions

5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	more generally .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	however , we agree with prof. park that " it is time to examine the sources of difficulty in clinical translation of nanomedicine and move forward " .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	but for reaching this goal , the investments to support clinical translation of promising nanomedicine formulations should increase , not decrease .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	as recently encouraged by ema in its roadmap to 2025 , we should create more unity through a common knowledge hub linking academia , industry , healthcare providers and hopefully policy makers to reduce the current fragmentation of the standardization and regulatory body landscape .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	we should also promote a strategy of cross - technology innovation , support nanomedicine development as a high value and low - cost solution to answer unmet medical needs and help the most promising innovative projects of the field to get better and faster to the clinic .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	this global vision is the one that the etpn chose to encourage for the last fifteen years .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	all actions should be taken with a clear clinical view in mind , " without any fanfare " , to focus " on what matters in real life " , which is the patient and his / her quality of life .
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	this etpn overview of achievements in nanomedicine serves to reinforce our drive towards further expanding and growing the maturity of nanomedicine for global healthcare , accelerating the pace of transformation of its great potential into tangible medical breakthroughs .

9aa38acaf58c4f7bdc2b8fce4a75f660abf314a2	new strategies to prevent and treat influenza virus infections are urgently needed .
9aa38acaf58c4f7bdc2b8fce4a75f660abf314a2	a recently discovered class of monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) neutralizing an unprecedented spectrum of influenza virus subtypes may have the potential for future use in humans .
9aa38acaf58c4f7bdc2b8fce4a75f660abf314a2	here , we assess the efficacies of cr6261 , which is representative of this novel class of mabs , and oseltamivir in mice .
9aa38acaf58c4f7bdc2b8fce4a75f660abf314a2	we show that a single injection with 15 mg / kg cr6261 outperforms a 5-day course of treatment with oseltamivir ( 10 mg / kg / day ) with respect to both prophylaxis and treatment of lethal h5n1 and h1n1 infections .
9aa38acaf58c4f7bdc2b8fce4a75f660abf314a2	these results justify further preclinical evaluation of broadly neutralizing mabs against influenza virus for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infections .
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	subgroup analysis of treatment effects plays an important role in applications from medicine to public policy to recommender systems .
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	it allows physicians ( for example ) to identify groups of patients for whom a given drug or treatment is likely to be effective and groups of patients for which it is not .
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	most of the current methods of subgroup analysis begin with a particular algorithm for estimating individualized treatment effects ( ite ) and identify subgroups by maximizing the difference across subgroups of the average treatment effect in each subgroup .
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	these approaches have several weaknesses : they rely on a particular algorithm for estimating ite , they ignore (
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	in)homogeneity within identified subgroups , and they do not produce good confidence estimates .
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	this paper develops a new method for subgroup analysis , r2p , that addresses all these weaknesses .
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	r2p uses an arbitrary , exogenously prescribed algorithm for estimating ite and quantifies the uncertainty of the ite estimation , using a construction that is more robust than other methods .
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	experiments using synthetic and semi - synthetic datasets ( based on real data ) demonstrate that r2p constructs partitions that are simultaneously more homogeneous within groups and more heterogeneous across groups than the partitions produced by other methods .
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	moreover , because r2p can employ any ite estimator , it also produces much narrower confidence intervals with a prescribed coverage guarantee than other methods .

7d5515797a6557b8fbecc6e6f3f46c32c2bfce93	one particularly promising setting for this could be triage : in italy , tents have been mounted outside the hospital as " field hospitals " to avoid contact between infected patients and noninfected ones .

7d5515797a6557b8fbecc6e6f3f46c32c2bfce93	a us - guided triage algorithm should be developed : one such proposal is shown in the figure .
7d5515797a6557b8fbecc6e6f3f46c32c2bfce93	limitations for the implementation of us triage are the lack of specific protocols and operator experience , which influences the validity of test results .
7d5515797a6557b8fbecc6e6f3f46c32c2bfce93	although the us triage has not yet been validated by prospective studies , it is a concept that needs prompt definition and investigation to improve our ability to decide which patients need hospitalization immediately when resources are limited and need to be conserved .
415da12bcec2afda93973648a48819c7b8da8741	the covid-19 pandemic has led to historic economic fallout .
415da12bcec2afda93973648a48819c7b8da8741	to protect public health and stabilize incomes , governments have implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages .
415da12bcec2afda93973648a48819c7b8da8741	these fiscal supports are crucial , though there is concern that sustainable and resilient development will be sacrificed in the rush to preserve incomes and industries .

6140703a4f59d2feadfcc54c1185770cbaa651dc	under the assumption of homogeneously mixing population and limited resources , we predicted expected number of infected , hospitalized , in intensive care units ( icu ) and deaths during this potential covid-19 outbreak .
6140703a4f59d2feadfcc54c1185770cbaa651dc	our results suggest that on a given day in cali there may be up to around 73000 cases who might need hospitalization under no intervention .
6140703a4f59d2feadfcc54c1185770cbaa651dc	however , this number drastically reduces if we carry out only - isolation intervention ( with 16 days of symptomatic infection ; ~13,000 cases ) versus both quarantining for 6 days and isolation within 16 days ( ~3500 cases ) .

46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	•
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	the impressive results from sweden and south korea ( countries without a lock - down ) , need a closer look in order to ascertain the reasons behind this finding .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	introduction and aims
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	: retarding the spread of sars - cov-2 infection by preventive strategies is the first line of management .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	several countries have declared a stringent lockdown in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	this analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lockdown on infection and death rates over a period of time in countries with declared lock - down .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	a validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lockdown .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	subsequently , a k - means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	sweden and south korea were included as counties without lockdown in a second - phase cluster analysis .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	there was a significant 61 % and 43 % reduction in infection rates 1-week post lockdown in the overall and india cohorts , respectively , supporting its effectiveness .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	countries with higher baseline infections and deaths(spain , germany , italy , uk , and france - cluster 1 ) fared poorly compared to those who declared lockdown early on ( and malaysia - cluster 2 ) .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	sweden and south korea , countries without lock - down , fared as good as the countries in cluster 2 .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	conclusion :
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	lockdown has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the sars - cov-2 disease progression(infection rate and death ) exponentially .
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	the success story of non - lock - down countries ( sweden and south korea ) need to be explored in detail , to identify the variables responsible for the positive results .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	schistosomiasis is a major human parasitic disease with a global impact .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	schistosoma japonicum , the most difficult to control , can survive within host veins for decades .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	mechanisms of immune evasion by the parasite , including antigenic variation and surface masking , have been implicated but not well defined .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	in this study , we defined the immunoglobulin - binding proteomes of s. japonicum using human igg , igm , and ige as the molecular bait for affinity purification , followed by protein identification by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	several proteins situated at the tegument of s. japonicum were able to nonselectively bind to the fc domain of host immunoglobulins , indicating a mechanism for the avoidance of host immune attachment and recognition .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	the profile of the immunoglobulin - binding proteomes provides further clues for immune evasion mechanisms adopted by s. japonicum .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	paramyosin ( scip-1 ) associated with the schistosomula of the parasite membrane of both s. mansoni and s. japonicum has been proposed both as a fc receptor of a nonspecific host igg and as an inhibitor of complement c9 polymerization 6,11 - 14 .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	sjc23 , a member of the tetraspanin ( tsp ) family of s. japonicum , mediated the acquisition of human igg via the interaction of a nine amino acid motif with the fc domain of the igg molecule 15 ; the specific antibodies after immunization with sjc23 were predominantly the igg2a type , which has been shown to be inefficient in complement fixation and to exhibit fewer cytophilic properties in adcc ( antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ) 16 .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	in this study , to investigate the host - schistosome interaction and the mechanism of immune evasion employed by s. japonicum , we applied immobilized versions of the non - immune human immunoglobulins g , m and e as molecular baits to selectively precipitate parasite interactive components that were subsequently identified by lc - ms / ms .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	the immunoglobulin binding proteomes of adult s. japonicum were obtained and analyzed carefully .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	our results will facilitate the rational design of vaccines based on schistosomal tegument - associated antigens .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	host immunoglobulins are abundantly observed on the surface of s. japonicum .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	to detect the binding of non - immune igg and igm on the surface of adult s. japonicum , igg - and igm - specific antibodies conjugated with a red fluorophore were separately incubated with either parasites directly flushed from the veins of infected mice or parasite sections .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	mouse igg was detected on the surface of both male and female intact adult worms using a laser confocal microscopy ( fig . 1a ) .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	the fluorescence visualized using fluorescence microscopy was more intense on the surface of male worms compared with that of females ( fig . 1b ) .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	indeed , imaging of frozen sections using the laser confocal microscopy showed that the fluorescence signals were located on the outermost layer of the blood fluke ( fig . 1c ) .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	additionally , mouse igm was also observed on the parasite surface ( fig . 2a ) , and the adsorption of human igg , igm and ige on the parasite surface was clearly observed ( fig . 2b - d ) .
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	no cross reactivity was observed with the secondary fluorescence - labeled antibodies ( data not shown ) .

157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	the covid-19 pandemic has hit at a time when microfinance is at its historical peak , with an estimated 139 million microfinance customers globally .
157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	cambodia 's microfinance sector is one of the fastest growing , and like others in the global south has moved from offering entrepreneurial capital to everyday liquidity , and even disaster relief .
157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	in this viewpoint , however , we argue that the promotion of microfinance as market - based relief and recovery from the pandemic should be a source of concern , not comfort .
157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	we firstly suggest that as a result of the health and economic impacts associated with covid-19 , credittaking is likely to escalate further in terms of the number of borrowers and loan amounts .
157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	second , we contend that a growing reliance on mfis will leave households undernourished , and further vulnerable to its disciplining and extractive impulses .
157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	third , we argue that the interplay between overindebtedness , pre - existing malnutrition challenges , and the global public health crisis of covid-19 represents a major challenge to gender equality and sustainable development .
157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	coordination between the cambodian government , microfinance lenders , international investors , and development partners is vital to offer debt relief .
157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	furthermore , to reverse the reliance of so many households on the microfinance industry for survival , inclusive socio - economic policies and public welfare services must be prioritised .
68796f21a652be08fda86711e4168aea86fe7af4	the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic challenged program leaders to respond rapidly to changes in healthcare delivery , protect trainee safety , and transform educational activities .

70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) has caused extensive economic losses to pig producers in many countries .
70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	it was recently introduced , for the first time , into north america and outbreaks have occurred again in multiple countries within europe as well .
70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	to assess the properties of various diagnostic assays for the detection of pedv infection , multiple panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of antibodies against pedv in an inter - laboratory ring trial .
70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	different laboratories have used a variety of " in house " elisas and also one commercial assay .
70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	the sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been estimated using a bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard .
70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	although different characteristics were found , it can be concluded that each of the assays used can detect infection of pigs at a herd level by either the early european strains of pedv or the recently circulating strains ( indel and non - indel ) .
70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	however , not all the assays seem suitable for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country .
70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	the results from individual animals , especially when the infection has occurred within an experimental situation , show more variation .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	background :
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	calls are increasing for widespread sars - cov-2 infection testing of people from populations with a very low prevalence of infection .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	we quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations , and on individuals , in low prevalence settings , focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	we developed a simple , interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity , specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000 .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	we derived numbers of true positives , true negatives , false positives and false negatives , positive predictive value
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	( ppv -the percentage of test positives that are true positives ) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies : ( 1 ) single test for all ;
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	( 2 ) add repeat testing in test positives ; ( 3 ) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	we also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one , two or three tests under these three strategies .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	with sensitivity of 80 % , infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000 , and specificity 99.9 % on all tests , ppv in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29 % with one test , increasing to > 99.5 % ( 100 % when rounded to the nearest % ) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3 .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	more realistically , if specificity is 95 % for the first and 99.9 % for subsequent tests , single test ppv will be only 1 % , increasing to 86 % with repeat testing in strategy 2 , or 79 % with strategy 3 ( albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2 ) .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	in the whole population , or in particular individuals , ppv increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity .
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	to avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations , and in particular individuals , from widespread population testing for sars - cov-2 , the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions .

48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	a big disaster intensifies such connections with statistical victims and with celebrities as audiences look for meaning , direction , and emotional outlet .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	as the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) infects every population , statistical people - once media 's remote victims of disaster - are now us , comprising nearly eight billion and summarized in escalating numbers of the infected , the surviving , and the dead .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	as the covid-19 pandemic unfolds , celebrities on social media have status as arbiters of this crisis , but an intensified domesticity has transformed their roles .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	glimpses into celebrities ' private lives , including their habitations , are essential to feelings of intimacy and kinship with them .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	the crafting of these seemingly private realms - including access to them - is part and parcel of celebrity marketing .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	in a disaster where massive numbers of people , worldwide , are forced to stay indoors , this display of domesticity is riveting .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	as people meet online , newly revealing their own domestic spaces for work and play , celebrities ' domestic spaces are screen openings among many such openings .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	as celebrities are seen going about their daily lives , they perform among many ordinary performances and in relation to them .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	the contrast of their strange lives to the ordinary could never be more pronounced .
48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	one of the more interesting transformations is the spectacle of action heroes - who would normally be racing to save the day - placidly reveling in domesticity .

63fa45c16f6687fe53e3e519a883eb73274036ba	clustering individuals into similar groups in longitudinal studies can improve time series models by combining information across like individuals .
63fa45c16f6687fe53e3e519a883eb73274036ba	while there is a well developed literature for clustering of time series , these approaches tend to generate clusters independently of the model training procedure which can lead to poor model fit .
63fa45c16f6687fe53e3e519a883eb73274036ba	we propose a novel method that simultaneously clusters and fits autoregression models for groups of similar individuals .
63fa45c16f6687fe53e3e519a883eb73274036ba	we apply a wishart mixture model so as to cluster individuals while modeling the corresponding autocorrelation matrices at the same time .
63fa45c16f6687fe53e3e519a883eb73274036ba	the fitted wishart scale matrices map to cluster - level autoregressive coefficients through the yule - walker equations , fitting robust parsimonious autoregressive mixture models .
63fa45c16f6687fe53e3e519a883eb73274036ba	this approach is able to discern differences in underlying serial variation of time series while accounting for an individual 's intrinsic variability .
63fa45c16f6687fe53e3e519a883eb73274036ba	we prove consistency of our cluster membership estimator and compare our approach against competing methods through simulation as well as by modeling regional covid-19 infection rates .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	a b s t r a c t stat1 belongs to the stat family of transcription factors , which comprises seven factors : stat1 , stat2 , stat3 , stat4 , stat5a , stat5b and stat6 .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	stat1 is a 91 kda protein originally identified as the mediator of the cellular response to interferon ( ifn ) a , and thereafter found to be a major component of the cellular response to ifng .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	stat1 is , in fact , involved in the response to several cytokines and to growth factors .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	it is activated by cytokine receptors via kinases of the jak family .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	stat1 becomes phosphorylated and forms a dimer which enters the nucleus and triggers the transcription of its targets .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	although not lethal at birth , selective gene deletion of stat1 in mice leads to rapid death from severe infections , demonstrating its major role in the response to pathogens .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	similarly , in humans who do not express stat1 , there is a lack of resistance to pathogens leading to premature death .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	this indicates a key , non - redundant function of stat1 in the defence against pathogens .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	thus , to successfully infect organisms , bacterial , viral or parasitic pathogens must overcome the activity of stat1 , and almost all the steps of this pathway can be blocked or inhibited by proteins produced in infected cells .
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	interestingly , some pathogens , like the oncogenic epsteinebarr virus , have evolved a strategy which uses stat1 activation .
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	during outbreaks of high - consequence pathogens , airport screening programs have been deployed to curtail geographic spread of infection .
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	the effectiveness of screening depends on several factors , including pathogen natural history and epidemiology , human behavior , and characteristics of the source epidemic .
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	we developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes .
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	we analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic .
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	we show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features , as well as human factors in implementation and compliance .
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	for pathogens with longer incubation periods , exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics , while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics .
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	for pathogens with short incubation , fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage .
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	however , even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases .

458924a78c9df5c48223e12a69a73258128c3f99	this study examined the determinants of the timing to implement an intervention .
458924a78c9df5c48223e12a69a73258128c3f99	through an impact analysis , the study explored the effects of the interventions and the potential risks of removing them under the context of reopening the economy .

30814fcc87b8f3e5d4f7431d75b9505b049021e0	the 2015 - 2016 emergence of zika virus ( zikv ) in the americas , and recognition that zikv 15 infection during pregnancy can result in birth defects , revealed a need for small animal models to 16 study zikv pathogenic mechanisms and evaluate candidate vaccines and antivirals .
30814fcc87b8f3e5d4f7431d75b9505b049021e0	mice would 17 be an attractive system for such studies , but zikv replicates poorly in laboratory mice because it 18 fails to antagonize murine stat2 and sting .
30814fcc87b8f3e5d4f7431d75b9505b049021e0	to address this , most zikv pathogenesis studies 19 have used mice with impaired interferon signaling
30814fcc87b8f3e5d4f7431d75b9505b049021e0	( e.g. ifnar1 -/or treatment with ifnar1-blocking 20 antibodies ) .
30814fcc87b8f3e5d4f7431d75b9505b049021e0	however , using mice with severe defects in innate antiviral signaling confounds 21 studies of viral pathogenic mechanisms .
30814fcc87b8f3e5d4f7431d75b9505b049021e0	collaborative cross ( cc ) mice have proven to be a 22 valuable system for developing new mouse pathogenesis models for viral infections that are not 23 well modeled in conventional laboratory mouse lines .

2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	the time window of the available population data is between february 24 and march 25 .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	after we upgrade the data until april 1 .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	we perform the analysis with 4 different models and we think that the best candidate to correctly described the italian situation is a generalized logistic equation .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	we use two coupled differential equations that model the evolution of the severe infected and the dead .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	this choice is due to the fact that in italy the pharyngeal swabs are made only to severe infected , therefore we have no information about asymptomatic people .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	moreover , an important observation is that the virus spreads between regions with some delay .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	indeed , we suggest that a different analysis , region by region , would be more sensible than one on the whole italy .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	in particular the region lombardy has a behaviour very fast compared to the other ones .
2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	we show the fit and forecast of the dead and total severe infected for italy and five regions :

2b401b9969d7d33b245e3ef715f8458f4658a950	finally we perform an analysis of the peak ( intended , in our study , as the maximum of the daily total severe infected ) and an estimation of how many lives have been saved by means of the lockdown .

2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	usually detection of coronavirus including sars - cov-2 was detected by real - time rt - pcr method , but it must be long time that rna is treated by extraction , concentration and purification , and detected by rt - pcr method .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	we modified various methods , of which evaluated if each method is short and simple enough .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	in another point of the evaluations , surprisingly , human coronavirus 229e , which was substituted for sars - cov-2 , could be detected in crude state without treatment in advance of rna .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	as that was , it was possible to detect coronavirus with direct rt - pcr .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	therefore , it might eliminate wasteful time , avoid secondary infection and risk of contamination .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	in light of the above two points , sars - cov-2 might be detected more quickly and more simply .
2b2976d4cd83243aaeb221c1888bd28aab84a0c2	with using this mobile real - time pcr , these methods should be suitable for not only sars - cov-2 but also other various viruses and might save time compared to earlier detection methods .

b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	coronavirus spike ( s ) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies .
b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	we show that sars - cov-2 s uses ace2 to enter cells and that the receptor - binding domains of sars - cov-2 s and sars - cov s bind with similar affinities to human ace2 , correlating with the efficient spread of sars - cov-2 among humans .
b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	we found that the sars - cov-2 s glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the s 1 /s 2 subunits , which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from sars - cov and sars - related covs .
b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	we determined cryo - em structures of the sars - cov-2 s ectodomain trimer , providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry .

6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	the highly pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai )
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	virus h5n1 causes multi - organ disease and death in poultry , resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	in addition , it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high ( 60 % ) mortality rate .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	effective vaccination against hpai h5n1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird - to - bird and bird - to - human transmission .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	in the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin ( sh5 3 ) produced in mammalian cells .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	the secreted , purified sh5 3 was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid - dependent manner .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	it was shown to protect chickens , in a dosedependent manner , against a lethal challenge with h5n1 after a single vaccination .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative rt - pcr on rna isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	also in mice , vaccination with sh5 3 provided complete protection against challenge with hpai h5n1 .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	conclusions / significance : our results demonstrate that sh5 3 constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against hpai h5n1 .
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	as these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time , they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses .

3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	while 39 the index patient showed a single nucleotide polymorphism only one variant was transmitted to the 40 recipients .
3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	different to the initial cluster , we observed in household clusters occurring at the time in 41 hamburg also intra - host viral species transmission events .
3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	42 conclusions : sars - cov-2 variant tracing highlights both , low infection dose transmissions suggestive 43 of fomites as route of infection in the initial cluster and high and low infection dose transmissions in 44 family clusters indicative of fomites and droplets as infection routes .
3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	this suggests ( 1 ) single viral 45 particle infection can be sufficient to initiate sars - cov-2 infection and ( 2 ) household / family members 46 are exposed to high virus loads and therefore have a high risk to acquire sars - cov-2 .

b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	previous findings show that corticosteroid treatment during the first acute wheezing episode may reduce recurrent wheezing in children with high rhinovirus genome load at 12-month follow - up .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	longer - term effects have not been investigated prospectively .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	methods :
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	after pcr confirmation of rhinovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate , 79 children with the first acute wheezing episode were randomized to receive orally prednisolone or placebo for 3 days .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	the initiation of asthma control medication before the age of 5 years was confirmed from medical record and/or from parental interview .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	the outcome was the time to initiation of regular asthma control medication .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	interaction analysis examined rhinovirus genome load .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	results :
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	fifty - nine ( 75 % ) children completed the follow - up .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	asthma control medication was initiated in 40 ( 68 % ) children at the median age of 20 months .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	overall , prednisolone did not affect the time to initiation of asthma control medication when compared to placebo ( p=.99 ) .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	rhinovirus load modified the effect of prednisolone regarding the time to initiation of asthma control medication ( p - value for interac - tion=.04 ) .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	in children with high rhinovirus load ( > 7000 copies / ml ; n=23 ) , the risk for initiation of medication was lower in the prednisolone group compared to the placebo group ( p=.05 ) .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	in the placebo group , asthma medication was initiated to all children with high rhinovirus load ( n=9 ) during the 14 months after the first wheezing episode .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	overall , prednisolone did not affect the time to initiation of asthma control medication when compared to placebo .
b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	however , prednisolone may be beneficial in first - time wheezing children whose episode was severe and associated with high rhinovirus load .

48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	it is known that the parameters in the deterministic and stochastic seir epidemic models are structurally identifiable .
48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	for example , from knowledge of the infected population time series i(t ) during the entire epidemic , the parameters can be successfully estimated .
48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	in this article we observe that estimation will fail in practice if only infected case data during the early part of the epidemic ( pre - peak ) is available .
48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	this fact can be explained using a long - known phenomenon called dynamical compensation .
48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	we use this concept to derive an unidentifiability manifold in the parameter space of seir that consists of parameters indistinguishable to i(t ) early in the epidemic .
48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	thus , identifiability depends on the extent of the system trajectory that is available for observation .
48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	although the existence of the unidentifiability manifold obstructs the ability to exactly determine the parameters , we suggest that it may be useful for uncertainty quantification purposes .
48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	a variant of seir recently proposed for covid-19 modeling is also analyzed , and an analogous unidentifiability surface is derived .

255e05f7b489ece5c5c60fdf312ba0a3dcffeb37	throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza - like illness were examined using real - time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus - specific primers , and then virus - positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products .
255e05f7b489ece5c5c60fdf312ba0a3dcffeb37	results :
255e05f7b489ece5c5c60fdf312ba0a3dcffeb37	hcov - nl63 infection was identified in 8.4 % ( 9/107 ) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia , but not found in outpatients with influenza - like illness .
255e05f7b489ece5c5c60fdf312ba0a3dcffeb37	age distribution of hcov - nl63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16e25 years ( 20 % ) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups , and exhibited a similar age - specific pattern to influenza a / h1n1 infection , but not influenza a / h3n2 and b infections in hospitalized patients .

f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	with the multiplication of covid-19 cases due to sars cov2 , some concerns about angiotensinconverting enzyme 1 ( ace1 ) inhibitors ( acei ) and angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers ( arb ) have emerged .
f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	because sars cov2 utilizes ace2 ( angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ) as a membrane receptor to enter target cells , the fear that acei or arb might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of covid-19 infection emerged .
f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	the present article discusses these concerns .
f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	ace2 is a membrane - bound enzyme ( carboxypeptidase ) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin ii and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin ii effects .
f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	due to different structural structures with ace1 , ace2 is insensitive to aceis .

0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	understanding the equilibrium between innate and adaptive protective responses and immune pathology might contribute to the development of strategies against asfv .
0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	here we compare , using a proteomic approach , the course of the in vivo infection caused by two homologous strains : the virulent e75 and the attenuated e75cv1 .
0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	our results show a progressive loss of proteins by day 7 post - infection ( pi ) with e75 , reflecting tissue destruction .
0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	many signal pathways were affected by both infections but in different ways and extensions .
0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	cytoskeletal remodelling and clathrin - endocytosis were affected by both isolates , while a greater number of proteins involved on inflammatory and immunological pathways were altered by e75cv1 .

0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	the implication of the rho gtpases by e75cv1 throughout infection is also evident .
0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	early events reflected the lack of e75 recognition by the immune system , an evasion strategy acquired by the virulent strains , and significant changes at 7 days post - infection ( dpi ) , coinciding with the peak of infection and the time of death .
0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	the protein signature at day 31 pi with e75cv1 seems to reflect events observed at 1 dpi , including the upregulation of proteosomal subunits and molecules described as autoantigens ( vimentin , hspb1 , enolase and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 ) , which allow the speculation that auto - antibodies could contribute to chronic asfv infections .
0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	therefore , the use of proteomics could help understand asfv pathogenesis and immune protection , opening new avenues for future research .

ac1be9c13b571359bb954195273ce3633dfd1aa1	approximately 75 % of all bicycle - related mortality is secondary to head injuries , 85 % of which could have been prevented by wearing a bicycle helmet .
ac1be9c13b571359bb954195273ce3633dfd1aa1	younger children appear to be at greater risk than adults , yet helmet use is low despite this risk and legislation and ordinances requiring helmet use among younger riders .
ac1be9c13b571359bb954195273ce3633dfd1aa1	we sought to determine whether bicycle helmets are associated with the incidence and severity of head injury among pediatric bicyclists involved in a bicycle crash involving a motor vehicle .

db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	effective treatment interventions for childhood obesity involve parents , are multicomponent and use behavior change strategies , but more information is needed on the mechanisms influencing behavioral outcomes and the type of parental involvement that is efficacious in behavioral treatment interventions with school - age children .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	this review aimed to understand key characteristics of programs that contribute to dietary and physical activity behavioral outcomes , and through which key mechanisms .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	this was a systematic review with narrative synthesis following prisma guidelines and realist analysis using rameses guidelines to explain outcome patterns and influence of parental involvement .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	overall , the findings contribute to understanding the complex relationship between family barriers to behavior change , strategies employed in treatment interventions and behavioral outcomes .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	implications for enhancing future policy and practice include involving parents in goal setting , motivational counselling , role modeling , and restructuring the physical environment to promote mutual empowerment of both parents and children , shared value and whole - family ownership in which intrinsic motivation and self - efficacy are implicit .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	these characteristics were associated with positive dietary and physical activity behavior change in children and may be useful considerations for the design and implementation of future theory - based treatment interventions to encourage habitual healthy diet and physical activity to reduce childhood obesity .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	recommend prevention and treatment of obesity in the primary school years should focus on parents , since this is when life habits are formed [ 9 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	whilst plenty of recent studies support evidence that parents exert high influence over energy balance behaviors in their children , making their involvement key to the success of child weight - management programs [ 10 , 11 ] , findings have varied on the extent and for what ages parental involvement is successful [ 12 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	facilitating sustainable behavior change in children via public health interventions is challenging due to inhibiting influences of social and family barriers to healthy behaviors in participants ' wider lives [ 13 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	a lack of parental or whole - family support can also impede new health behaviors being maintained long term [ 14 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	many authors have acknowledged the importance of parental involvement in childhood obesity treatment interventions and positive health - related outcomes .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	however , many ' family - based ' interventions vary in their level and type of parent / carer involvement .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	some interventions have focused on parents as the exclusive agents of change [ 15 , 16 ] , where key elements consist of strengthening parents ' leadership skills , to take the focus off children being identified as the ( obese ) patient and overcome associated negative psychological issues and resistance to change .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	other studies have promoted parent support of the child 's behavior change [ 16 , 17 ] , with parents responsible for creating a supportive environment and empowering children to make informed choices .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	finally , some studies have aimed to change both parent and child behaviors simultaneously [ 18 , 19 ] , with children and parents making behavior change commitments together in the intervention .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	a recent review of 70 rcts ( 64 multicomponent , involving both parent and child ) on the effects of diet , physical activity and behavior change interventions for overweight children
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	[ 20 ] concluded that multicomponent interventions that incorporate diet , physical activity and behavior change strategies may be beneficial in achieving small short - term reductions in bmi , bmiz and weight in children aged 6 - 11 years .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	however , only a handful of the 56 studies that measured behavior change outcomes actually reported behavioral outcomes related to dietary ( n = 2 studies ) or physical activity ( n = 8 studies ) behavior change , and the review called for standardized reporting of key outcomes and mechanisms of behavior change .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	implementation challenges associated with interventions based on behavioral theory present barriers to upscaling and translation into natural settings due to a lack of contextual information on factors that influence behavioral lifestyle outcomes [ 21 ]
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	[ 22 ] [ 23 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	in the past decade , systematic reviews of child and family - focused treatment interventions targeting obesity - related behavior change in overweight children have indicated small positive short - term outcomes on dietary and physical activity behaviors [ 5 , 24 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	however , high heterogeneity across included studies ( varied methodologies , settings , and intervention strategies ) has been common to most systematic reviews , limiting the applicability of the findings and providing insufficient evidence for policy relevance or to support upscaling [ 5 , 25 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	overall , a better understanding is needed of patterns of outcomes across the family - based literature , and how the interaction between different program characteristics and behavior change strategies influence lifestyle behaviors such as heathy eating and physical activity in overweight and obese children .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	the traditional systematic review methodology aims to minimize bias in order to provide a summary of the effectiveness of interventions in terms of their effect sizes .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	however , this approach can oversimplify the inherently contextual nature of interventions [ 26 - 28 ] and may not account for the complex relationship of interactions between context , mechanisms and outcomes [ 29 ] .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	as a result , realist reviews are emerging as an alternative ' theory - driven ' approach to systematic reviews in public health research , as they are particularly relevant for understanding complex multicomponent interventions such as those prioritizing childhood obesity .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	however , there are currently no realist reviews on family - based behavior change interventions for overweight and obese children , measuring multiple obesity - related behavioral lifestyle outcomes and focusing on parental involvement .
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	this review aimed to enrich understanding of the ways child - focused behavior change treatment interventions contribute to reported obesity - related behavioral outcomes ( specifically diet and physical activity behavioral outcomes as opposed to interventions based on healthy eating and physical activity behaviors for preventing obesity ) and the influence of specific program characteristics and mechanisms .

65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	a rapid review was performed to determine ( 1 ) the number and causes of reported laboratory - acquired infections ( lai ) in the asia - pacific region ; ( 2 ) their significance and threat to the community ; ( 3 ) the primary risk factors associated with lais ; ( 4 ) the consequences in the event of a lai or pathogen escape ; and ( 5 ) to make general recommendations regarding biosafety practices for diagnosis and research in the asia - pacific region .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	a search for lai and zoonoses in the asia - pacific region using online search engines revealed a relatively low number of reports .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	only 27 lai reports were published between 1982 and 2016 .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	the most common pathogens associated with lais were dengue virus , arthroderma spp . ,

65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	seventy - eight percent ( 21 out of 27 lai reports ) occurred in high - income countries ( i.e. , australia , japan , south korea , singapore , and taiwan ) where laboratories were likely to comply with international biosafety standards .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	two upper - middle income countries ( china ( 2 ) , and malaysia ( 2 ) ) and one lower - middle income country ( india ( 2 ) ) reported lai incidents .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	the majority of the reports ( fifty - two percent ( 14/27 ) ) of lais occurred in research laboratories .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	five lai reports were from clinical or diagnostic laboratories that are considered at the frontier for zoonotic disease detection .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	governments and laboratories in the asia - pacific region should be encouraged to report lai cases as it provides a useful tool to monitor unintended release of zoonotic pathogens and to further improve laboratory biosafety .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	non - reporting of lai events could pose a risk of disease transmission from infected laboratory staff to communities and the environment .
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	the international community has an important and continuing role to play in supporting laboratories in the asia - pacific region to ensure that they maintain the safe working environment for the staff and their families , and the wider community .

6502c3388992f092a0a91e11c54287d77a9c5196	medrxiv preprint third , there is uncertainty inherent to any model - based forecast which uses the empirical estimation of seroprevalence , regardless of the quality of the test , in part because of the uncertain relationship between seropositivity and immunity ( 2 ) .
6502c3388992f092a0a91e11c54287d77a9c5196	a clear evidence - based guide to aid the design of serological studies is critical to policy makers and public health officials both for estimation of seroprevalence and for forward - looking modeling efforts , particularly if serological positivity reflects immune protection .
6502c3388992f092a0a91e11c54287d77a9c5196	to address this need , we developed a framework that can be used to design and interpret serological studies , with applicability to sars - cov-2 .
6502c3388992f092a0a91e11c54287d77a9c5196	starting with results from a serological survey of a given size and age stratification , the framework incorporates the test 's sensitivity and specificity and enables estimates of population seroprevalence that include uncertainty .
6502c3388992f092a0a91e11c54287d77a9c5196	these estimates can then be used in models of disease spread to calculate the effective reproductive number r eff , the transmission potential of sars - cov-2 under partial immunity , to forecast disease dynamics , and to assess the impact of candidate public health and clinical interventions .
6502c3388992f092a0a91e11c54287d77a9c5196	similarly , starting with a pre - specified tolerance for uncertainty in seroprevalence estimates , the framework can be used to define the sample size needed .
6502c3388992f092a0a91e11c54287d77a9c5196	this framework can be used in conjunction with any model , including ode models ( 3 , 4 ) , agent - based simulations ( 5 ) , or network simulations ( 6 ) , and can be used to estimate r eff or to simulate transmission dynamics .

98b07ff87d658b09a3284a78b88ebe5687475d5a	these receptors are extremely polymorphic , and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide - binding repertoire .
98b07ff87d658b09a3284a78b88ebe5687475d5a	however , despite this polymorphism , class i molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires .
98b07ff87d658b09a3284a78b88ebe5687475d5a	almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) alleles and defined nine different groups , denominated as supertypes , on the basis of their main anchor specificity .
98b07ff87d658b09a3284a78b88ebe5687475d5a	the utility of this original supertype classification , as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others , has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies .
98b07ff87d658b09a3284a78b88ebe5687475d5a	results : following our original approach , in the present report we provide an updated classification of hla - a and -b class

3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	in the pandemic , testing for sars - cov-2 by rt - pcr is one of the pillars on which countermeasures are based .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	conserving reagents by pooling samples in lowprobability settings is proposed , but may cause dilution and loss of sensitivity .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	blood transfusion services had experience in performance of high throughput nat analysis and can support the national health system by screening of the inhabitants for sars - cov-2 .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	methods :
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	we evaluated a new approach of a multiple swab method by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	analytical sensitivity was constant up to a total number of 50 swabs .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	it was consequently applied in the testing of 50 symptomatic patients ( five - sample pools ) as well as 100 asymptomatic residents of a nursing home ( tensample pools ) .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	results :
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	the novel method did not cause false negative results with non - significantly differing ct values between single swab and multiple swab nat .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	in two routine applications , all mini pools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	conclusions :
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	the new method enables countries to increase the total number of testing significantly .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	the multiple swab method is able to screen system relevant groups of employees frequently .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	secondly the example in germany shows that blood transfusion services can support general health systems with their experience in nat and their high throughput instruments .
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	screening of a huge number of inhabitants is currently the only option to prevent a second infection wave and enable exit strategies in many countries .

014a55cb08ccc365edec9cc8366705b4c629a534	we also examine ways that community - based organizations can adapt to the challenges associated with covid-19 and continue providing services to the community .
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	captcha is a human - centred test to distinguish a human operator from bots , attacking programs , or other computerised agent that tries to imitate human intelligence .
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	in this research , we investigate a way to crack visual captcha tests by an automated deep learning based solution .
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	the goal of this research is to investigate the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the captcha generator systems ; hence , developing more robust captchas , without taking the risks of manual try and fail efforts .
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	we develop a convolutional neural network called deep - captcha to achieve this goal .
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	the proposed platform is able to investigate both numerical and alphanumerical captchas .
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	to train and develop an efficient model , we have generated a dataset of 500,000 captchas to train our model .

841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	our network 's cracking accuracy leads to a high rate of 98.94 % and 98.31 % for the numerical and the alpha - numerical test datasets , respectively .
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	that means more works is required to develop robust captchas , to be noncrackable against automated artificial agents .
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	as the outcome of this research , we identify some efficient techniques to improve the security of the captchas , based on the performance analysis conducted on the deep - captcha model .

5deab2fd52284a43b2fe49b9bd9fef5064408a67	in this study , the expression of eleven housekeeping genes typically used for the normalization of quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) analysis in mammals were compared in cefs infected with h5n1 aiv to determine the most reliable reference genes in this system .
5deab2fd52284a43b2fe49b9bd9fef5064408a67	cefs cultured from 10-day - old spf chicken embryos were infected with 100 tcid 50 of h5n1 aiv and harvested at 3 , 12 , 24 and 30 hours post - infection .
5deab2fd52284a43b2fe49b9bd9fef5064408a67	the expression levels of the eleven reference genes in infected and uninfected cefs were determined by real - time pcr .
5deab2fd52284a43b2fe49b9bd9fef5064408a67	based on expression stability and expression levels , our data suggest that the ribosomal protein l4 ( rpl4 ) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide ( ywhaz ) are the best reference genes to use in the study of host cell response to h5n1 aiv infection .
5deab2fd52284a43b2fe49b9bd9fef5064408a67	however , for the study of replication levels of h5n1 aiv in cefs , the β - actin gene ( actb ) and the ribosomal protein l4 ( rpl4 ) gene are the best references .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	transthoracic echocardiogram ( tte ) is commonly used to screen for pulmonary hypertension ( phtn ) in neonates and young infants .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	however , in the absence of sufficient tricuspid regurgitation ( tr ) , a ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) , or a patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) , the estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure ( spap ) becomes challenging .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	pulmonary artery acceleration time ( paat ) is an alternate parameter that is easy to obtain in almost all patients and does not require the presence of tricuspid valvar regurgitation or an anatomical cardiac defect .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	we sought to examine the correlation of paat with estimated spap by tte and create an equation to estimate the spap using paat .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	we performed a retrospective review of ttes performed on neonates and young infants ( 4 months of age or younger ) at our institution between april 2017 and december 2018 , along with the corresponding medical records .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	we included ttes that provided estimation for spap and at least one paat measurement .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	during the study period , 138 ttes performed on 82 patients met the inclusion criteria .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	strong correlation was delineated between paat and spap estimated by the maximum velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation doppler , correlation coefficient ( r )
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	= − 0.83 .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	moderate correlation was detected between paat and spap estimated by pda doppler , r = − 0.66 .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	utilizing the following equation " spap =
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	82.6 − 0.58 × paat + ra mean pressure " , paat can be used to estimate spap in neonates and young infants .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	paat can be used as an alternative to tr jet to assess spap when the latter is absent or insufficient .
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	further studies are needed to verify the accuracy of this equation .

85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	the paper presents a feasibility study for heart rate measurement using a digital camera to perform health monitoring .
85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	the feasibility study investigates the reliability of the state of the art heart rate measuring methods in realistic situations .
85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	therefore , an experiment was designed and carried out on 45 subjects to investigate the effects caused by illumination , motion , skin tone , and distance variance .
85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	the experiment was conducted for two main scenarios ; human - computer interaction scenario and health monitoring scenario .
85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	the human - computer scenario investigated the effects caused by illumination variance , motion variance , and skin tone variance .
85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	the health monitoring scenario investigates the feasibility of health monitoring at public spaces ( i.e. airports , subways , malls ) .
85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	five state of the art heart rate measuring methods were re - implemented and tested with the feasibility study database .
85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	the results were compared with ground truth to estimate the heart rate measurement error .
85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	the heart rate measurement error was analyzed using mean error , standard deviation ; root means square error and pearson correlation coefficient .

4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the spike is a hallmark coronavirus protein that determines virus fusion , entry and spread in the host , and thus holds clues for the rapid spread of the sars - cov-2 pandemic .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	we have investigated the spike from six β - coronaviruses , including the sars - cov-2 , and find that their surfaceexposed fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus - host membrane fusion process .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the sars - cov-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties , accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the specific contribution of these prolines has been inferred from comparative studies of their deletion mutant in a fellow murine β - coronavirus mhv - a59 that show significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the spike cleavage - linked priming and fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the sars - cov-2 spread .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	summary .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the spike protein on the sars - cov-2 surface is the prime mediator of covid-19 1 because of its central role in virus - host attachment , virus - entry , and virus - spread 2 .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the contagious nature of sars - cov-2 infection has been attributed to dense glycosylation of the spike glycoprotein 3 , its high affinity of binding to human ace2 receptor 4 , and cleavage 5 .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	while these may be imperative , it does not explain the uncontrolled infectivity .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	here we show that properties of the fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop of sars - cov-2 spike that triggers the virus fusion , distinguishes it from the other five β - coronaviruses .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the sars - cov-2 spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic , including the surface contributed by the fusion peptides .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the fusion peptides are structurally rigid owing to its consecutive prolines , aromatic / hydrophobic clusters , a stretch of consecutive β - branched amino acids , and the hydrogen bonds .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the role of rigidity accrued from the presence of consecutive prolines contributing to virus fusogenicity can be deciphered from our previous murine β - coronavirus , mhv - a59 studies 6 .
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	the synergy brought about by the global location of the surface exposed fusion peptides , their physicochemical features , and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the fusion process , which may explain the severity of the infection and widespread nature of the covid-19 pandemic .

044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	animals : one hundred dairy calves with naturally acquired brd .
044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	methods :
044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	calves were sampled by all 4 methods .
044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	viral agents were identified by real - time rt - pcr , bacteria were identified by aerobic culture , and mycoplasma bovis ( m. bovis )
044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	isolates were speciated by pcr .
044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	agreement among ttw and ns , nps , or bal was evaluated by calculating the kappa statistic and percent positive agreement .
044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	mcnemar 's exact test was used to compare the proportions of positive results .
044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	results : agreement among ttw and ns , ttw and nps , and ttw and bal , was very good for identification of p. multocida , m. haemolytica , and m. bovis .

d9e20259293f9ead8950a4eb61eda2ca377f803e	the possible transport of pathogenic microorganisms during asian dust events could be an important concern for health workers ; however , this is still uncertain owing to a lack of supporting evidence .
d9e20259293f9ead8950a4eb61eda2ca377f803e	the present study aimed to investigate the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in air samples collected during the asian and non - asian dust periods .
d9e20259293f9ead8950a4eb61eda2ca377f803e	between march and september 2016 , air samples were collected at three weather observation stations in seoul using a high - volume air sampler .

e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	despite efforts aimed at forecasting the course of the pandemic extrapolating from reports of the early onset in wuhan , china , heterogeneity in the transmission seems to be an important characteristic of sars - cov-2 between countries .
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	the study of the progress of the disease with a single set of transmission parameters is complicated by the application of different levels of containment measures at different stages of the pandemic .
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	methods :
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	we studied the variation in transmission of covid-19 globally and individually for 18 countries .
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	we developed a piecewise fitting methodology to model the progress of the covid-19 epidemic for a set of countries with a number of confirmed infections in excess of 1000 cases .
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	our study uses the susceptible - exposed - infected - removed ( seir ) model to assess the contagious contact rate ( β ) of sars - cov-2 at different stages of the pandemic as a metric of the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing the spread of covid-19 .
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	we extrapolate the results of our fittings to evaluate the effect of a reduction of β on the level of burden laid on local health care infrastructure considering different levels of intervention and to estimate the maximum number of cases and potential peak date to inform future public health interventions .
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	results :
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	according to the current trend , we project that the peak in the number of infections worldwide will take place after the third quarter of 2020 .
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	for 12 out of the 17 countries analyzed , the projections suggest that the number of severe infections will surpass the healthcare capacity .
e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	additionally , it is observed that 4 out of the 17 analyzed will undergo a significant delay in the peak of the infection for a 90 % reduction of the transmission rate , and thus extending the course of the epidemic further than the 365 day simulation window .

ece09d9492d3605d3216709a1e178c2d0786b240	as the number of people infected with the newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus ( sars - cov2 ) is continuously increasing every day , development of potential therapeutic platforms is vital .
ece09d9492d3605d3216709a1e178c2d0786b240	based on the comparatively high similarity of receptor - binding domain ( rbd ) in sars - cov2 and sars - cov , it seems crucial to assay the cross - reactivity of anti - sars - cov monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) with sars - cov2 spike ( s)-protein .
ece09d9492d3605d3216709a1e178c2d0786b240	indeed , developing mabs targeting sars - cov2 s - protein rbd could show novel applications for rapid and sensitive development of potential epitope - specific vaccines ( esv ) .
ece09d9492d3605d3216709a1e178c2d0786b240	herein , we present an overview on the discovery of new cov followed by some explanation on the sars - cov2 s - protein rbd site .
ece09d9492d3605d3216709a1e178c2d0786b240	furthermore , we surveyed the novel therapeutic mabs for targeting s - protein rbd such as s230 , 80r , f26g18 , f26g19 , cr3014 , cr3022 , m396 , and s230.15 .
ece09d9492d3605d3216709a1e178c2d0786b240	afterwards , the mechanism of interaction of rbd and different mabs were explained and it was suggested that one of the sars - cov - specific human mabs , namely cr3022 , could show the highest binding affinity with sars - cov2 s - protein rbd .

f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	leishmaniosis caused by leishmania infantum is a parasitic disease of people and animals transmitted by sand fly vectors .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	although dogs in south and central italy are most affected , in recent decades feline leishmaniosis ( fel ) has become an emerging disease .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	this study aimed to update information on the presence of fel in stray cats in milan , in northern italy ; to compare these results with previous studies performed in the same area ; and to report aspects of leishmania infection in cats .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	a total of 117 stray cats were included and 10 ( 8.6 % ) had l. infantum infection .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	the parasite was identified in popliteal lymph nodes in five cats and five had antibodies against l. infantum .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	most infected cats were from a specific area of milan .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	increased gammaglobulins were seen in infected cats , which also had antibodies against the pathogens anaplasma phagocytophilum , chlamydophila felis , and toxoplasma gondii .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	there was a high prevalence of fel in the surveyed area of northern italy .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	further studies are needed to understand if these infected cats are being imported from other areas , or if there is a real leishmania focus in milan .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	investigation of the presence of sand fly vectors in milan would be useful .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	abstract :
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	feline leishmaniosis ( fel ) is an emerging vector - borne feline disease , with increasing numbers of cases reported and studies performed internationally .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	this study aimed to update the epidemiological status for fel in stray cats in milan , northern italy ; compare these results with previous studies in northern italy ; and report clinicopathologic findings and coinfections in cats infected with leishmania spp .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	a total of 117 cats were tested for l. infantum and retrovirus infection , hematological , and biochemical parameters .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	demographic and clinical data were collected and fel affected cats screened for selected coinfections .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	overall , 10/117 ( 8.6 % ) cats tested positive for l. infantum : in five cats l. infantum dna was found in popliteal lymph nodes and five were ifat seropositive at titers from 1:80 to 1:160 .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	infected cats were concentrated in a specific area of milan ( p = 0.0154 ) .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	no specific clinicopathologic abnormalities or retroviral infections were significantly linked to the infection , other than hypergammaglobulinemia ( p = 0.0127 ) .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	seroreactivity to anaplasma phagocytophilum , chlamydophila felis , and toxoplasma gondii was found in some infected cats .
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	a high prevalence of fel was found in a non - endemic area of northern italy and future studies
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	should continually monitor this data to understand whether these cases are imported or if leishmania vectors are present in this area .
7faf551b9bf12e8f1f1033ed73fdb5861811e6bf	we propose a new method for novelty detection that can tolerate nontrivial corruption of the training points .
7faf551b9bf12e8f1f1033ed73fdb5861811e6bf	previous works assumed either no or very low corruption .
7faf551b9bf12e8f1f1033ed73fdb5861811e6bf	our method trains a robust variational autoencoder ( vae ) , which aims to generate a model for the uncorrupted training points .
7faf551b9bf12e8f1f1033ed73fdb5861811e6bf	to gain robustness to corruption , we incorporate three changes to the common vae : 1 .

59cee2c2d1c8e2b5c732523f10682153c278395c	in contrast to −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting ( prf ) stimulation by an rna pseudoknot downstream of frameshifting sites , a refolding upstream rna hairpin juxtaposing the frameshifting sites attenuates −1 prf in human cells and stimulates +1 frameshifting in yeast .
59cee2c2d1c8e2b5c732523f10682153c278395c	this eukaryotic functional mimicry of the internal shine - dalgarno ( sd ) sequence - mediated duplex was confirmed directly in the 70s translation system , indicating that both frameshifting regulation activities of upstream hairpin are conserved between 70s and 80s ribosomes .
59cee2c2d1c8e2b5c732523f10682153c278395c	unexpectedly , a downstream pseudoknot also possessed two opposing hungry codon - mediated frameshifting regulation activities : attenuation of +1 frameshifting and stimulation of a non - canonical −1 frameshifting within the +1 frameshift - prone cuuuga frameshifting site in the absence of release factor 2 ( rf2 ) in vitro .
59cee2c2d1c8e2b5c732523f10682153c278395c	however , the −1 frameshifting activity of the downstream pseudoknot is not coupled with its +1 frameshifting attenuation ability .
59cee2c2d1c8e2b5c732523f10682153c278395c	similarly , the +1 frameshifting activity of the upstream hairpin is not required for its −1 frameshifting attenuation function
59cee2c2d1c8e2b5c732523f10682153c278395c	thus , each of the mrna duplexes flanking the two ends of a ribosomal mrna - binding channel possesses two functions in bi - directional ribosomal frameshifting regulation : frameshifting stimulation and counteracting the frameshifting activity of each other .

5b33034f7b37a76557b4d2db72be64720e73ec15	in this report , we evaluate the hypothesis that hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in patients with defects of lymphocyte cytotoxicity is usually triggered by infections .

43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	background :
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	increased vascular permeability is a key feature in the pathophysiology of sepsis and the development of organ failure .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx is increasingly being recognized as an important pathophysiological mechanism but at present it is unclear if glypicans contribute to this response .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	we hypothesized that plasma levels of glypicans ( gpc ) are elevated in patients with sepsis .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	methods :
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	plasma gpc 1 - 6 levels were measured by elisa in 10 patients with sepsis and 10 healthy controls as an initial screening .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	plasma gpc 1 , 3 , and 4 were further measured in a cohort of 184 patients with a clinically confirmed infection .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	patients were divided into groups of those who had sepsis and those who had an infection without organ failure .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	to determine whether plasma glypicans could predict the development of organ failure , patients were further subdivided to those who had organ failure at enrolment and those who developed it after enrollment .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	the association of plasma gpc 1 , 3 , and 4 with organ failure and with various markers of inflammation , disease severity , and glycocalyx shedding was investigated .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	results :
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	in the pilot study , only gpc 1 , 3 , and 4 were detectable in the plasma of sepsis patients .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	in the larger cohort , gpc 1 , 3 , and 4 levels were significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) in patients with sepsis than in those with infection without organ failure .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	gpc 1 , 3 , and 4 were significantly positively correlated with plasma levels of the disease severity markers c - reactive protein , lactate , procalcitonin , and heparin binding protein , and with the marker of glycocalyx degradation syndecan 1 .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	they were significantly negatively correlated with plasma levels of the glycocalyx - protective factors apolipoprotein m and sphingosine-1-phosphate .
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	conclusions :
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	we show that gpc 1 , 3 , and 4 are elevated in plasma of patients with sepsis and correlate with markers of disease severity , systemic inflammation , and glycocalyx damage .

8b3a987c599ef93544357312c807fbdd5093d5ab	( ifitm1 , ifitm2 and ifitm3 ) have recently been identified as potent antiviral effectors that function to suppress the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses and modulate cellular tropism independent of viral receptor expression .
8b3a987c599ef93544357312c807fbdd5093d5ab	however , the antiviral effect and mechanisms of ifitms in response to viral infections remain incompletely understood and characterized .
8b3a987c599ef93544357312c807fbdd5093d5ab	in this work , we focused our investigation on the function of the extracellular ifitm3 protein .
8b3a987c599ef93544357312c807fbdd5093d5ab	in cell models of denv-2 infection , we found that ifitm3 contributed to both the baseline and interferon - induced inhibition of denv entry .

0ad5f44fc605d1d2759a22c05a4883b9ec05b234	many real prediction tasks such as molecular property prediction require ability to extrapolate to unseen domains .
0ad5f44fc605d1d2759a22c05a4883b9ec05b234	the success in these tasks typically hinges on finding a good representation .
0ad5f44fc605d1d2759a22c05a4883b9ec05b234	in this paper , we extend invariant risk minimization ( irm ) by recasting the simultaneous optimality condition in terms of regret , finding instead a representation that enables the predictor to be optimal against an oracle with hindsight access on held - out environments .
0ad5f44fc605d1d2759a22c05a4883b9ec05b234	the change refocuses the principle on generalization and does n't collapse even with strong predictors that can perfectly fit all the training data .

0ad5f44fc605d1d2759a22c05a4883b9ec05b234	( rgm ) approach can be further combined with adaptive domain perturbations to handle combinatorially defined environments .

1ca7321158dbe79c32b808f85af8716df74f238f	we took inspiration from the success of network propagation in diverse applications in systems biology ( 8) .
1ca7321158dbe79c32b808f85af8716df74f238f	our underlying hypothesis was that network propagation was a reasonable mechanism for predicting sars - cov-2 interactors .
1ca7321158dbe79c32b808f85af8716df74f238f	to test this hypothesis , we conducted the following validation .
1ca7321158dbe79c32b808f85af8716df74f238f	for each interactor of a sars - cov-2 protein ( 7 ) , we computed the propagation score ( also called " diffusion score " or " heat " in the literature ) treating all the other interactors of sars - cov-2 as sources .
1ca7321158dbe79c32b808f85af8716df74f238f	to this end , we applied the regularized laplacian ( rl ) ( 9 ) , a widely - used technique for semi - supervised learning ( " methods " ) .
1ca7321158dbe79c32b808f85af8716df74f238f	these scores were significantly larger than the scores of randomly - selected nodes

76084d8a83f9bb96d6c340245baba445fd35fa79	this article critically studies coronavirus ( covid-19 ) pandemic news in the press .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	covid-19 has become a global pandemic .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	immune dysregulation has been implicated , but immune responses remain poorly understood .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	we analyzed 71 covid-19 patients compared to recovered and healthy subjects using high dimensional cytometry .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	integrated analysis of ~200 immune and > 30 clinical features revealed activation of t cell and b cell subsets , but only in some patients .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	a subgroup of patients had t cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection and plasmablast responses could reach > 30 % of circulating b cells .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	however , another subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable to uninfected subjects .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	stable versus dynamic immunological signatures were identified and linked to trajectories of disease severity change .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	these analyses identified three " immunotypes " associated with poor clinical trajectories versus improving health .
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	these immunotypes may have implications for therapeutics and vaccines .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	building on a series of ground breaking reviews that first defined and drew attention to emerging infectious diseases ( eid ) , the ' convergence model ' was proposed to explain the multifactorial causality of disease emergence .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	the model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co - incidence of genetic , physical environmental , ecological , and social factors .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	we developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai )
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	h5n1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land - use change .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization , we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri - urban landscapes with significantly higher hpai h5n1 emergence risk .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	the work highlights that peri - urban areas of viet nam have higher levels of chicken densities , duck and geese flock size diversities , and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	we also found that land - use diversity , a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission , significantly improves the model 's predictability .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	similarly , landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk .
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	these results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve eid prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs .
b0aac5df054c02ec2cda12e95db6e3537ad745fc	within the context that greece promises a success story in the fight against the disease , this paper proposes a novel method to study the evolution of the greek covid-19 infection - curve in relation to the anti - covid-19 policies applied to control the pandemic .
b0aac5df054c02ec2cda12e95db6e3537ad745fc	based on the ongoing spreading of covid-19 and the insufficient data for applying classic time - series approaches , the analysis builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the greek covid-19 infection - curve as a complex network .
b0aac5df054c02ec2cda12e95db6e3537ad745fc	by using the modularity optimization algorithm , the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining periods of different connectivity in the time - series body .
b0aac5df054c02ec2cda12e95db6e3537ad745fc	these periods reveal a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease , starting with a power pattern , where a second order polynomial ( u - shaped ) pattern intermediates , being followed by a couple of exponential patterns , and ending up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the greek covid-19 infection - curve tends into saturation .
b0aac5df054c02ec2cda12e95db6e3537ad745fc	the network analysis also illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low - degree nodes , implying a low probability to meet maximum ( infection ) values at the future and high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average .
b0aac5df054c02ec2cda12e95db6e3537ad745fc	the overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel method for the structural decomposition of a time - series into periods , which allows removing from the series the disconnected past - data facilitating better forecasting , and provides insights of good policy and decision - making practices and management that may help other countries improve their performance in the war against covid-19 .
2db28d2cd54bf5a567c433e55b4b7071707707d1	heterogeneity of interindividual and intraindividual responses to interventions is often observed in randomized , controlled trials for obesity .
2db28d2cd54bf5a567c433e55b4b7071707707d1	to address the global epidemic of obesity and move toward more personalized treatment regimens , the global research community must come together to identify factors that may drive these heterogeneous responses to interventions .
2db28d2cd54bf5a567c433e55b4b7071707707d1	this project , called obedis
2db28d2cd54bf5a567c433e55b4b7071707707d1	( obesity diverse interventions sharing -focusing on dietary and other interventions ) , provides a set of european guidelines for a minimal set of variables to include in future clinical trials on obesity , regardless of the specific endpoints .
2db28d2cd54bf5a567c433e55b4b7071707707d1	broad adoption of these guidelines will enable researchers to harmonize and merge data from multiple intervention studies , allowing stratification of patients according to precise phenotyping criteria which are measured using standardized methods .
2db28d2cd54bf5a567c433e55b4b7071707707d1	in this way , studies across europe may be pooled for better prediction of individuals ' responses to an intervention for obesity
2db28d2cd54bf5a567c433e55b4b7071707707d1	-ultimately leading to better patient care and improved obesity outcomes .

aa5b3284c6aa3151c2165660f2f9479ac8d0c94f	since the first known case of a covid-19 infected patient in wuhan , china on 8 december 2019 , covid-19 has spread to more than 200 countries , causing a worldwide public health crisis .
aa5b3284c6aa3151c2165660f2f9479ac8d0c94f	the existing literature fails to examine what caused this sudden outbreak from a crisis management perspective .
aa5b3284c6aa3151c2165660f2f9479ac8d0c94f	this article attempts to fill this research gap through analysis of big data , officially released information and other social media sources to understand the root cause of the crisis as it relates to china 's current management system and public health policy .
aa5b3284c6aa3151c2165660f2f9479ac8d0c94f	the article draws the following conclusions : firstly , strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements , which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of covid-19 .
aa5b3284c6aa3151c2165660f2f9479ac8d0c94f	secondly , a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature , and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time , lead to falsehood and concealment .
aa5b3284c6aa3151c2165660f2f9479ac8d0c94f	thirdly , the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis .

aa5b3284c6aa3151c2165660f2f9479ac8d0c94f	this article suggests that china should adopt a singaporean - style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time .

9817181e3f1c7e2f11e4efc1e7add7a9b35653cf	however , he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms .
9817181e3f1c7e2f11e4efc1e7add7a9b35653cf	he was hospitalized , with intravenous ( iv ) ceftriaxone .
9817181e3f1c7e2f11e4efc1e7add7a9b35653cf	computerized tomography scan of his abdomen - pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis , so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin .
9817181e3f1c7e2f11e4efc1e7add7a9b35653cf	despite this , the patient 's condition deteriorated .
9817181e3f1c7e2f11e4efc1e7add7a9b35653cf	laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement : decreasing platelets , raised creatinine , and deranged liver panel .

ee37e006cb0198e82db141fecb0b7fe985a59acc	by analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and 19 clinical research teams , we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in 20 the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for covid-21 19 coagulopathy .
ee37e006cb0198e82db141fecb0b7fe985a59acc	this regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with 22 influenza a virus (

ee37e006cb0198e82db141fecb0b7fe985a59acc	we analyzed three publicly available rna sequencing datasets to identify possible molecular 44 etiologies of covid-19 associated coagulopathies .
ee37e006cb0198e82db141fecb0b7fe985a59acc	these data sets include sequencing libraries 45 from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( balf ) and peripheral blood 46 mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) from sars - cov-2 positive patients and healthy controls .
ee37e006cb0198e82db141fecb0b7fe985a59acc	we also 47 analyzed a publicly available rna sequencing dataset derived from in vitro sars - cov-2 48 infected primary normal human bronchial epithelial ( nhbe ) cells and mock infected samples .

ee37e006cb0198e82db141fecb0b7fe985a59acc	we found that 50 sars - cov-2 infection induces the activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and 51 suppression of the plasminogen activation system in both nhbes and cells isolated from the 52 balf .
ee37e006cb0198e82db141fecb0b7fe985a59acc	pbmcs did not differentially express genes regulating blood coagulation .

6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	hundred viruses can be isolated in patients suffering from respiratory virus infections and hospitalised in intensive care unit ( icu ) :
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	influenza virus , respiratory syncytial virus , parainfluenza virus , adenovirus , coronavirus , rhinovirus , enterovirus , human metapneumovirus , bocavirus … nasal or tracheobronchial specimens , which contain many epithelial cells will be used to isolate these common viruses .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	in immunocompromised patients a bronchoalveolar lavage has to be added to these specimens in order to detect cytomegalovirus and some adenovirus .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	the immunofluorescence or immunoenzymatic assays , which detect viral antigens in the infected cells are the easiest and fastest diagnostic methods , theoretically .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	as with other techniques , specimen quality is a major determinant of their performance .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	unfortunately , the sensitivity of the antigen detection assays is low in respiratory infections in adults .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	then the virus recovery by cell culture , which is usually more sensitive than the antigen detection assays , can be helpful .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	many studies have reported more respiratory virus detections using nucleic acid testing such as pcr .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	they detect viruses , which are missed by conventional methods and increase the detection of common respiratory virus .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	multiplex pcr assays have been developed , and these can simultaneously detect several viruses directly in clinical specimens .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	nucleic acid testing can subtype viruses using subtype - specific primers , and analyse strain variation through genetic .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	it can be used also to quantify the viral load in clinical specimens .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	more recently real - time rt - pcr assays have been developed to get more rapidly the results of the nucleic acids assays .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	specimen quality , timing and transportation conditions may be less critical for nucleic acid testing than for culture or antigen detection , as viable virus and intact infected cells need not to be preserved .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	moreover , viral nucleic acids are detectable for several days longer into the clinical course than is cultivable virus , potentially allowing a diagnosis to be made in late - presenting patients .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	however , in a clinical virology laboratory , where the speed , low cost , and high sensitivity of the methods are required , the sequential use of antigen detection tests and multiplex pcr could be the best choice , particularly in the clinical setting of respiratory virus infections in adults hospitalised in icu .
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	in the future , the development of real - time multiplex pcr is likely to be top - priority .

05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	rapid molecular diagnosis of infections has contributed to timely treatments and antimicrobial stewardship .
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	however , the benefit and cost - effectiveness vary in each country or community because they have different standard practices and health care systems .
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	in japan , rapid antigen tests ( rats ) have been frequently used for pediatric respiratory infections .
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	we investigated the impact and cost - effectiveness of a multiplex pcr ( mpcr ) respiratory panel for pediatric respiratory infections in a japanese community hospital .
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	methods :
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	we replaced rats with an mpcr respiratory panel ( filmarray ® ) for admitted pediatric respiratory infections on march 26 , 2018 .
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	we compared the days of antimicrobial therapy ( dot ) and length of stay ( los ) during the mpcr period
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	( results : during the rat and mpcr periods , 1132 and 149 patients were analyzed .
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	the dot / case was 12.82 vs 8.56 ( p < 0.001 ) , and the los was 8.18 vs 6.83 days ( p ¼ 0.032 ) in the rat and mpcr groups , respectively .
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	the total costs during admissions were \258,824 ( $ 2331.7 ) and \243,841 ( $ 2196.8)/case , respectively .
05bf31bd4268e117ef95d313ddec2e77fab52315	pathogen detection rates were 30.2 % vs 87.2 % ( p < 0.001 ) .

d2e314ff89c2a578ca7f69bb450d3ac019708144	practical steps suggested are protective equipment use , ensuring access to critical drugs ( such as opioids ) , greater use of telemedicine consultations , discussing advance care plans , and embracing the role of a wider community support .
0f45da571ca739a0ec5c818fa2d39025398673d7	seoul virus ( seov ) is a zoonotic orthohantavirus carried by black and brown rats , and can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans .
0f45da571ca739a0ec5c818fa2d39025398673d7	human cases of seov virus infection have most recently been reported in the usa , united kingdom , france and the netherlands and were primarily associated with contact with pet rats and feeder rats .
0f45da571ca739a0ec5c818fa2d39025398673d7	infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection .
0f45da571ca739a0ec5c818fa2d39025398673d7	little is known about the cell tropism of seov in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature .
0f45da571ca739a0ec5c818fa2d39025398673d7	here we report the histopathological analysis of seov cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats , comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles .
0f45da571ca739a0ec5c818fa2d39025398673d7	all adult rats in this study were positive for seov specific antibodies and viral rna in their tissues .
0f45da571ca739a0ec5c818fa2d39025398673d7	one juvenile rat was seropositive , but negative in the rrt - pcr .

446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	the outbreak of covid19 has been declared a global pandemic by who which started in wuhan last november and now has spread to more than 200 countries with 4.5 million cases and a death toll of more than 300 thousand .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	in response , many countries have implemented lock down to ensure social distancing and started rigorously quarantining the infected subjects .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	here we utilized the infection dynamics available from who and quantitatively calibrated the confirmed , recovered , and dead populations from 23 different countries .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	the chosen countries chosen are in three stages of infection 1 .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	where the first wave of infection is significantly diminished 2 .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	infection peak is reached but daily infection still persists significantly 3 .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	the infection peak is not yet reached .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	the model successfully captured the daily trajectories of countries with both early and late phase of infection and determined incubation time , transmission rate , quarantine and recovery rates .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	our analysis shows , the reduction in the estimated reproduction number with time is significantly correlated to the testing rate and medical facility of a country .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	further , our model identifies that an increase in quarantine rate through more testing could be the most potent strategy to substantially reduce the undetected infection , accelerate the time to infection peak and facilitate faster recovery of a nation from the first infection wave , which could perhaps have direct social and economic implications .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	our model also shows , that post lockdown infection spread towards a much larger second wave can be controlled via rigorous increase in the quarantine rates which could be tailored in a country specific manner ; for instance , our simulations suggest that usa or spain would require a 10 fold more increase in quarantine rates compared to india to control the second wave post lockdown .
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	our data driven modeling and analysis of the trajectories from multiple countries thus pave a way to understand the infection dynamics during and post lockdown phases in various countries and it can help strategize the testing and quarantine processes and influence the spread of the disease in future .

b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) is a newly emerged infection in humans affecting the arabian peninsula , europe , and north africa .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	the source and persistence of the infection in humans remains unknown .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	the aim of this paper was to apply a risk analysis approach to the epidemiology of mers - cov and to understand the source of ongoing infections .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	the epidemiology of mers - cov was reviewed and compared to sars .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	each observed feature of mers - cov epidemiology was summarized and fitted to either an epidemic or one of two sporadic scenarios ( either animal or deliberate release ) .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	as of may 2014 , mers - cov has infected over 681 people and killed a further 204 over 2 years .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	in contrast , there were 8,273 cases and 775 deaths from sars within 8 months .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	mers - cov has a more sporadic pattern unlike the clear epidemic pattern seen with sars , and an unusual concentration of cases in the middle east , without epidemics in other countries to which it has spread .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	sars , with a higher reproductive number ( r0 ) , was eliminated from humans within 8 months of emerging , yet mers - cov , with a low r0 has persisted in humans over a far more prolonged period .
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	this is at odds with the expected behavior of a virus with a low r0 , which theoretically should not persist unless there are ongoing introductions of infection into humans , and poses the question ' ' what is the source of continuing infections in humans ?

ff59b843f749e5472741aeb4d0165abeb371b73e	since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in december 2019 , more than 2,500,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with sars - cov-2 as of april 22 .
ff59b843f749e5472741aeb4d0165abeb371b73e	in response to this epidemic , china has issued seven trial versions of diagnosis and treatment protocol for covid-19 .
ff59b843f749e5472741aeb4d0165abeb371b73e	according to the information that we have collected so far , this article provides an overview of potential therapeutic drugs and compounds with much attention , including favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine , as well as traditional chinese medicine , which have been reported with good clinical treatment effects .

e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	the sars - cov2 virus binds to the ace2 receptor for cell entry .
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	it has been suggested that aceinhibitors ( acei ) and angiotensin-2 blockers ( arb ) , which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise tissue ace2 levels , could increase the risk of severe covid19 infection .
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	we evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with covid19 at two hospitals with a multi - ethnic catchment population in london ( uk ) .
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	the mean age was 68±17 years ( 57 % male ) and

e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	415 patients ( 34.6 % ) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21-days of symptom onset .
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	399 patients ( 33.3 % ) were taking acei or arb .
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	patients on acei / arb were significantly older and had more comorbidities .
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	the odds ratio ( or ) for the primary endpoint in patients on acei and arb , after adjustment for age , sex and co - morbidities , was 0.63
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	( ci 0.47 - 0.84 , p<0.01 ) .
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	there was no evidence for increased severity of covid19 disease in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with acei or arb .
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	a trend towards a beneficial effect of acei / arb requires further evaluation in larger meta - analyses and randomised clinical trials .
7e6c74ffdbd859bb855347418beea3d1449930dd	worldwide , as of july 2020 , > 13.2 million people have been infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) virus .
7e6c74ffdbd859bb855347418beea3d1449930dd	the spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) ranges from mild illness to critical illness in 5 % of cases .

b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	the 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) appeared in december 2019 and then spread throughout the world rapidly .
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	the virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) 2 and modulates the expression of ace2 in host cells .
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	ace2 , a pivotal component of the renin - angiotensin system , exerts its physiological functions by modulating the levels of angiotensin ii ( ang ii ) and
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	ang-(1 - 7 ) .
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	we reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ace2 in the female reproductive system , hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-ncov to female fertility .
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	the available evidence suggests that ace2 is widely expressed in the ovary , uterus , vagina and placenta .
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	therefore , we believe that apart from droplets and contact transmission , the possibility of mother - to - child and sexual transmission also exists .
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	ang ii , ace2 and ang-(1 - 7 ) regulate follicle development and ovulation , modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration , and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development .
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	taking these functions into account , 2019-ncov may disturb the female reproductive functions through regulating ace2 .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	epizootic pathogens pose a major threat to many wildlife species , particularly in the context of rapidly changing environments .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	pangolins ( order pholidota ) are highly threatened mammals , in large part due to the trade in illegal wildlife .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	during july to august 2018 four sick wild pangolins ( three manis javanica and one manis pentadactyla ) exhibiting a variety of clinical symptoms were rescued by the jinhua wildlife protection station in zhejiang province , china .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	although three of these animals died , fortunately one recovered after 2 weeks of symptomatic treatment .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	using meta - transcriptomics combined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) , we identified two novel rna viruses in two of the dead pangolins .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	genomic analysis revealed that these viruses were most closely related to pestiviruses and coltiviruses , although still highly genetically distinct , with more than 48 and 25 per cent sequence divergence at the amino acid level , respectively .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	we named these dongyang pangolin virus ( dypv ) and lishui pangolin virus ( lspv ) based on the sampling site and hosts .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	although coltiviruses ( lspv ) are known to be transmitted by ticks , we found no evidence of lspv in ticks sampled close to where the pangolins were collected .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	in addition , although dypv was present in nymph ticks ( amblyomma javanense ) collected from a diseased pangolin , they were not found in the local tick population .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	epidemiological investigation revealed that both novel viruses might have been imported following the illegal international trade of pangolins .
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	hence , these data indicate that illegal wildlife trafficking not only threatens the status of pangolin populations , but may also spread epizootic pathogens .

8aa983c0b271769d151b40c58bda6a3d3c0b47e8	accumulating evidence for the role of ecyps in disease pathogenesis stimulated research on the mechanisms of ecyp - initiated events , resulting in identification of multiple signaling pathways , characterization of a variety of effector molecules released from ecyp - treated cells , and synthesis of csa derivatives specifically blocking ecyps .
8aa983c0b271769d151b40c58bda6a3d3c0b47e8	however , a number of important questions related to the mode of action of ecyps remain unanswered .

8aa983c0b271769d151b40c58bda6a3d3c0b47e8	extracellular cyclophilins are critical players in pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases .
8aa983c0b271769d151b40c58bda6a3d3c0b47e8	their mechanism of action involves interaction with the receptor , cd147 , and initiation of a poorly characterized signal transduction process culminating in chemotaxis and production of pro - inflammatory factors .
8aa983c0b271769d151b40c58bda6a3d3c0b47e8	general significance - extracellular cyclophilins present an attractive target for therapeutic interventions that can be used to alleviate symptoms and consequences of acute and chronic inflammation .

23c3f5aab84c1bf1506a574ccf17d8cf9d1e681f	the covid-19 crisis has created a " mental health pandemic " throughout the world .
23c3f5aab84c1bf1506a574ccf17d8cf9d1e681f	scientific data are not available to fully understand the nature of the resulting mental health impact given the very recent onset of the pandemic , nevertheless , there is a need to act immediately to develop psychotherapeutic strategies that may alleviate pandemic - related distress .
23c3f5aab84c1bf1506a574ccf17d8cf9d1e681f	the psychological distress , in particular fear and sadness , is a function of the pandemic 's negative impact upon people 's ability to meet their most basic needs ( e.g. , physical safety , financial security , social connection , participation in meaningful activities ) .

7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	aviation alters the composition of the atmosphere globally and can thus drive climate change and ozone depletion .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	the last major international assessment of these impacts was made by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) in 1999 .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	here , a comprehensive updated assessment of aviation is provided .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	scientific advances since the 1999 assessment have reduced key uncertainties , sharpening the quantitative evaluation , yet the basic conclusions remain the same .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	the climate impact of aviation is driven by long - term impacts from co 2 emissions and shorter - term impacts from non - co 2 emissions and effects , which include the emissions of water vapour , particles and nitrogen oxides ( no x ) .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	the presentday radiative forcing from aviation ( 2005 ) is estimated to be 55 mw
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	m à2 ( excluding cirrus cloud enhancement ) , which represents some 3.5 % ( range 1.3 - 10 % , 90 % likelihood range ) of current anthropogenic forcing , or 78 mw m à2 including cirrus cloud enhancement , representing 4.9 % of current forcing ( range 2 - 14 % , 90 % likelihood range ) .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	according to two sres - compatible scenarios , future forcings may increase by factors of 3 - 4 over 2000 levels , in 2050 .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	the effects of aviation emissions of co 2 on global mean surface temperature last for many hundreds of years ( in common with other sources ) , whilst its non - co 2 effects on temperature last for decades .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	much progress has been made in the last ten years on characterizing emissions , although major uncertainties remain over the nature of particles .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	emissions of no x result in production of ozone , a climate warming gas , and the reduction of ambient methane ( a cooling effect )
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	although the overall balance is warming , based upon current understanding .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	these no x emissions from current subsonic aviation do not appear to deplete stratospheric ozone .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	despite the progress made on modelling aviation 's impacts on tropospheric chemistry , there remains a significant spread in model results .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	the knowledge of aviation 's impacts on cloudiness has also improved : a limited number of studies have demonstrated an increase in cirrus cloud attributable to aviation although the magnitude varies : however , these trend analyses may be impacted by satellite artefacts .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	the effect of aviation particles on clouds ( with and without contrails ) may give rise to either a positive forcing or a negative forcing : the modelling and the underlying processes are highly uncertain , although the overall effect of contrails and enhanced cloudiness is considered to be a positive forcing and could be substantial , compared with other effects .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	the debate over quantification of aviation impacts has also progressed towards studying potential mitigation and the technological and atmospheric tradeoffs .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	current studies are still relatively immature and more work is required to determine optimal technological development paths , which is an aspect that atmospheric science has much to contribute .
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	in terms of alternative fuels , liquid hydrogen represents a possibility and may reduce some of aviation 's impacts on climate if the fuel is produced in a carbon - neutral way : such fuel is unlikely to be utilized until a ' hydrogen economy '

131af5ab50551638e3ce9a8c615b9b4364f2f34e	using reverse genetics , we removed open reading frame 3 ( orf3 ) and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein ( rfp ) gene to generate icpedv- ⌬ orf3-rfp .
131af5ab50551638e3ce9a8c615b9b4364f2f34e	icpedv- ⌬ orf3-rfp replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo , was efficiently transmitted among pigs , and produced lethal disease outcomes .
131af5ab50551638e3ce9a8c615b9b4364f2f34e	however , the diarrheic scores in icpedv- ⌬ orf3-rfp - infected pigs were lower than those in wild - type - virus - or icpedv - infected pigs , and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of pc22a.
131af5ab50551638e3ce9a8c615b9b4364f2f34e	together , these data describe the development of a robust reverse - genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo , providing key infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting .

131af5ab50551638e3ce9a8c615b9b4364f2f34e	though the disease has been circulating internationally for decades , the lack of a rapid reverse - genetics platform for manipulating pedv and identifying genetic factors that impact transmission and virulence has hindered the study of this important agricultural disease .

00720d56a308d5afe9f85b97645abae3d324ae59	the other three variant isolates formed novel genotype detected recently in many countries of western europe .
00720d56a308d5afe9f85b97645abae3d324ae59	for one of these variant viruses , italy-02 , which afterwards became the prototype strain , the entire s1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality .
00720d56a308d5afe9f85b97645abae3d324ae59	in contrast , phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial n gene sequences , comprising 1 - 300 nucleotides , revealed different clustering .
00720d56a308d5afe9f85b97645abae3d324ae59	thus , three variant ibvs of novel italy-02 genotype , which had 96.7 - 99.2 % s1 gene nucleotide identity with each other , belonged to three separate subgroups based on n gene sequences .

192b72ce0845c685d87d68809b741ddbe6c35558	in this study , we demonstrate that treatment of vero e6 cells with interleukin-4 ( il-4 ) decreased the susceptibility of these cells to sars - cov infection .
192b72ce0845c685d87d68809b741ddbe6c35558	in contrast to ifns , il-4 did not show antiviral activity when administered immediately after sars - cov infection , suggesting that il-4 acts early during the sars - cov replication cycle .
192b72ce0845c685d87d68809b741ddbe6c35558	indeed , binding of recombinant sars - cov spike protein to vero e6 cells was diminished on cells treated with il-4 , but also on cells exposed to ifn - γ .
192b72ce0845c685d87d68809b741ddbe6c35558	consistent with these observations ,
192b72ce0845c685d87d68809b741ddbe6c35558	il-4
192b72ce0845c685d87d68809b741ddbe6c35558	and ifn - γ downregulated cell surface expression of angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , the sars - cov receptor .
192b72ce0845c685d87d68809b741ddbe6c35558	besides diminished ace2 cell surface expression , ace2 mrna levels were also decreased after treatment with these cytokines .
192b72ce0845c685d87d68809b741ddbe6c35558	these findings suggest that il-4 and ifn - γ inhibit sars - cov replication partly through downregulation of ace2 .
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	the genus henipavirus within the family paramyxoviridae includes the hendra virus ( hev ) and nipah virus ( niv ) which were discovered in the 1990s in australia and malaysia , respectively , after emerging to cause severe and often fatal outbreaks in humans and animals .
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	while hev is confined to australia , more recent niv outbreaks have been reported in bangladesh , india and the philippines .
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	the clinical manifestations of both henipaviruses in humans appear similar , with a predominance of an acute encephalitic syndrome .
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	likewise , the pathological features are similar and characterized by disseminated , multi - organ vasculopathy comprising endothelial infection / ulceration , vasculitis , vasculitis - induced thrombosis / occlusion , parenchymal ischemia / microinfarction , and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system ( cns ) , lung , kidney and other major organs .
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	this unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis - induced microinfarction and neuronal infection causes severe tissue damage in the cns .
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	both viruses can also cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection .
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	many animal models studied to date have largely confirmed the pathology of henipavirus infection , and provided the means to test new therapeutic agents and vaccines .
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	as the bat is the natural host of henipaviruses and has worldwide distribution , spillover events into human populations are expected to occur in the future .

59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	by april 7th , 2020 , the coronavirus disease 2019 has infected one and a half million people worldwide , accounting for over 80 thousand of deaths in 209 countries and territories around the world .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	the new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	in the absence of vaccines or effective treatments , mitigation policies , such as social isolation and lock - down of cities , have been adopted , but the results vary among different countries .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	some countries were able to control the disease at the moment , as is the case of south korea .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	others , like italy , are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	finally , countries with emerging economies and social issues , like brazil , are in the initial phase of the pandemic .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	in this work , we use mathematical models with time - dependent coefficients , techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification , and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the covid-19 in the three countries mentioned above .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	the model parameters estimated for south korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies , border control , and a high number in the percentage of reported cases .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	in contrast , underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in brazil and italy .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	in addition , the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in brazil , with a reduction of contact around 40 % , whereas italy and south korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75 % and 90 % , respectively .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	this characterization of the covid-19 , in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic , supports the importance of mitigation policies , such as social distancing .
59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	in addition , it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries , where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the covid-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	the recent outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) coronavirus infection in korea resulted in large socioeconomic losses .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	this provoked the korean government and the general public to recognize the importance of having a well - established system against infectious diseases .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	although epidemiologic investigation is one of the most important aspects of prevention , it has been pointed out that much needs to be improved in korea .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	we review here the current status of the korean epidemiologic service and suggest possible supplementation measures .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	we examine the current national preventive infrastructure , including human resources such as epidemic intelligence service officers , its governmental management , and related policies .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	in addition , we describe the practical application of these resources to the recent mers outbreak and the progress in preventive measures .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	the spread of mers demonstrated that the general readiness for emerging infectious diseases in korea is considerably low .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	we believe that it is essential to increase society 's investment in disease prevention .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	fostering public health personnel , legislating management policies , and establishing research centers for emerging infectious diseases are potential solutions .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	evaluating international preventive systems , developing cooperative measures , and initiating improvements are necessary .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	we evaluated the korean epidemiologic investigation system and the public preventive measures against infectious diseases in light of the recent mers outbreak .
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	we suggest that governmental authorities in korea enforce preventive policies , foster the development of highly qualified personnel , and increase investment in the public health domain of infectious disease prevention .
5a85cf34eee367f1a73ac62a05779d4c815dc767	francisella tularensis is classified as a tier 1 select agent by the cdc due to its low infectious dose and the possibility that the organism can be used as a bioweapon .
5a85cf34eee367f1a73ac62a05779d4c815dc767	the low dose of infection suggests that francisella is unusually efficient at evading host defenses .
5a85cf34eee367f1a73ac62a05779d4c815dc767	although~50 cfu are necessary to cause human respiratory infection , the early interactions of virulent francisella with the lung environment are not well understood .

e0928044da01740e830bf59e2e9e47c0f61688e3	a major limitation of current humanized mouse models is that they primarily enable the analysis of human - specific pathogens that infect hematopoietic cells .
e0928044da01740e830bf59e2e9e47c0f61688e3	however , most human pathogens target other cell types , including epithelial , endothelial and mesenchymal cells .
e0928044da01740e830bf59e2e9e47c0f61688e3	here , we show that implantation of human lung tissue , which contains up to 40 cell types , including nonhematopoietic cells , into immunodeficient mice ( lung - only mice ) resulted in the development of a highly vascularized lung implant .
e0928044da01740e830bf59e2e9e47c0f61688e3	we demonstrate that emerging and clinically relevant human pathogens such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus , zika virus , respiratory syncytial virus and cytomegalovirus replicate in vivo in these lung implants .
e0928044da01740e830bf59e2e9e47c0f61688e3	when incorporated into bone marrow / liver / thymus humanized mice , lung implants are repopulated with autologous human hematopoietic cells .
e0928044da01740e830bf59e2e9e47c0f61688e3	we show robust antigen - specific humoral and t - cell responses following cytomegalovirus infection that control virus replication .
e0928044da01740e830bf59e2e9e47c0f61688e3	lung - only mice and bone marrow / liver / thymus - lung humanized mice substantially increase the number of human pathogens that can be studied in vivo , facilitating the in vivo testing of therapeutics .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	this study proposes a simulation model of a new type of infectious disease based on smallpox , ebola haemorrhagic fever and a health policy game .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	sir ( susceptible , infected , recovered ) model has been widely used to analyse infectious diseases such as influenza , smallpox , bioterrorism , to name a few .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	on the other hand , agent - based model or individual - based model begins to spread in recent years .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	the model enables to represent behaviour of each person in the computer .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	it also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	the study designs a model based on epstein 's model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccine stocks , antiviral medicine stocks , the number of medical staff to infection control measures and so on .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	furthermore , infectious simulation of ebola haemorrhagic fever , which has not yet any effective vaccine , is also implemented in the model .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	as results of experiments using the model , it has been found that preventive vaccine , antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread .
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	in addition , a health policy game against a new type of infectious disease is designed as a serious game .
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	asthma is a heterogeneous and chronic inflammatory family of disorders of the airways with increasing prevalence that results in recurrent and reversible bronchial obstruction and expiratory airflow limitation .
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	these diseases arise from the interaction between environmental and genetic factors , which collaborate to cause increased susceptibility and severity .
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	many asthma susceptibility genes are linked to the immune system or encode enzymes like metalloproteases (
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	e.g. , adam-33 ) or serine proteases .
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	the s9 family of serine proteases ( prolyl oligopeptidases ) is capable to process peptide bonds adjacent to proline , a kind of cleavageresistant peptide bonds present in many growth factors , chemokines or cytokines that are important for asthma .
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	curiously , two serine proteases within the s9 family encoded by genes located on chromosome 2 appear to have a role in asthma :
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	cd26 / dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( dpp4 ) and dpp10 .
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	the aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about cd26 and to provide a structured overview of the numerous functions and implications that this versatile enzyme could have in this disease , especially after the detection of some secondary effects ( e.g. , viral nasopharyngitis ) in type ii diabetes mellitus patients ( a subset with a certain risk of developing obesity - related asthma ) upon cd26 inhibitory therapy .
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	we analyzed the role of their pulmonary images in predicting the severity and diagnosis of the disease .
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	methods :
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	among 97 patients with confirmed novel h1n1 infection , 42 patients treated with mechanical ventilation formed group 1 , and the remaining 55 patients constituted group 2 .
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	the initial and subsequent radiograhic findings in groups 1 and 2 were compared with respect to the pattern , distribution , and extent of the abnormality .
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	results :
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	in group 1 , 24 patients presented with three or more lung zone diseases , whereas only 5 patients in group 2 demonstrated these findings ( p<0.001 ) .
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	a pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax was observed in 24/42 patients in group 1 and in 18/55 patients in group 2 ( p=0.019 ) .
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	twelve patients in group 1 and 5 in group 2 developed a ground - glass opacity cyst with a honeycomb appearance ( p=0.007 ) .
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	conclusions :
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	the most common radiographic and computed tomography findings in children who were severely infected with s - oiv included unilateral or bilateral ground - glass opacities with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation .
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	children with bilateral involvement or with greater opacity on the chest radiographs were more likely to worsen and require the mechanical ventilation .

71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	coronavirus disease 2019 predisposes patients to a prothrombotic state with demonstrated microvascular involvement .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	the degree of hypercoagulability appears to correlate with outcomes , however optimal criteria to assess for the highest risk patients for thrombotic events remain unclear ; we hypothesized that deranged
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	thromboelastography ( teg ) measurements of coagulation would correlate with thromboembolic events .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	patients admitted to an intensive care unit with covid-19 diagnoses that had teg analyses performed were studied .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	conventional coagulation assays , d - dimer levels , and viscoelastic parameters were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new onset renal failure .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	forty - four patients with covid-19 were included in the analysis .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	derangements in coagulation laboratory values including elevated d - dimer , fibrinogen , pt , and ptt were confirmed ; viscoelastic parameters showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis at 30 minutes .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	a complete lack of lysis of clot at 30 minutes was seen in 57 % of patients and predicted vte with an auroc of .742

71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	overall , patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a d - dimer of greater than 2600 ng / ml had a rate of vte of 50 % compared to 0 % for patients with neither risk factor ( p=0.008 ) and had a hemodialysis rate of 80 % compared to 14 % ( p=0.004 ) .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	fibrinolysis shutdown , as evidenced by elevated d - dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography , predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with covid-19 .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	covid-19 icu patients are hypercoagulable .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	fibrinolysis shutdown as demonstrated by complete lack of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography combined with elevated d - dimer levels predicts thromboembolic complications and new onset kidney failure .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	patients with covid-19 have frequent complications of venous thromboembolism , stroke , and kidney failure .
71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	a lack of any clot lysis on thromboelastogram combined with elevated d - dimer levels identifies a high - risk population potentially requiring more aggressive anticoagulation .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	background : dihydromyricetin ( dmy ) is an important plant flavonoid , which has received great attention due to its health - benefiting activities , including antioxidant , antimicrobial , anti - inflammatory , anticancer , antidiabetic and neuroprotective activities .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	dmy capsules have been sold in us as a nutraceutical supplement to prevent alcoholic hangovers .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	the major disadvantage associated with dmy is its chemical instability and poor bioavailability caused by the combined effects of its low solubility and poor membrane permeability .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	this limits its practical use in the food and pharmaceutical fields .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	scope and approach : the present paper gives an overview of the current methods for the identification and quantification of dmy .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	furthermore , recent findings regarding the main biological properties and chemical stability of dmy , the metabolism of dmy as well as different approaches to increase dmy bioavailability in both aqueous and lipid phases are discussed .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	key findings and conclusions : current trends on identification and quantification of dmy have been focused on spectral and chromatographic techniques .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	many factors such as heat , ph , metal ions , could affect the chemical stability of dmy .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	despite the diverse biological effects of dmy , dmy faces with the problem of poor bioavailability .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	utilization of different delivery systems including solid dispersion , nanocapsule , microemuslion , cyclodextrin inclusion complexes , co - crystallization , phospholipid complexes , and chemical or enzymatic acylation has the potential to improve both the solubility and bioavailability .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	dmy digested in laboratory animals undergoes reduction , dehydroxylation , methylation , glucuronidation , and sulfation .
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	novel dmy delivery systems and basic pharmacokinetic studies of encapsulated dmy on higher animals and humans might be required in the future .

a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	businesses and governments are implementing technologies and policies in order to improve air quality .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	despite this the pm 10 air quality in the mining town of moranbah , australia , has worsened since measurements commenced in 2011 .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	the annual average pm 10 concentrations during 2012 , 2017 , 2018 and 2019 have all exceeded the australian national environmental protection measure 's standard , and there has been an increase in the frequency of exceedances of the daily standard .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	the average annual increase in pm 10 was 1.2 ± 0.5 µg m −3 between 2011 and 2019 and has been 2.5 ± 1.2
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	µg m −3 since 2014 .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	the cause of this has not previously been established .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	here , two machine learning algorithms ( gradient boosted regression and random forest ) have been implemented to model and then meteorologically normalise pm 10 mass concentrations measured in moranbah .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	the best performing model , using the random forest algorithm , was able to explain 59 % of the variance in pm 10 using a range of meteorological , environmental and temporal variables as predictors .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	an increasing trend after normalising for these factors was found of 0.6 ± 0.5 µg m −3 since 2011 and 1.7 ± 0.3 µg m −3 since 2014 .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	these results indicate that more than half of the increase in pm 10 is due to a rise in local emissions in the region .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	the remainder of the rise in pm 10 was found to be due to a decrease of soil water content in the surrounding region , which can facilitate higher dust emissions .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	whether the presence of open - cut coal mines exacerbated the role of soil water content is unclear .
a7723570f01f77c550556a1bf53167dae2959c74	although fires can have drastic effects on the local air quality , changes in fire patterns j

767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	background :
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	independent of pain intensity , pain - specific distress is highly predictive of pain treatment needs , including the need for prescription opioids .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	given the inherently distressing nature of chronic pain , there is a need to equip individuals with pain education and self - regulatory skills that are shown to improve adaptation and improve their response to medical treatments .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	brief , targeted behavioral medicine interventions may efficiently address the key individual factors , improve self - regulation in the context of pain , and reduce the need for opioid therapy .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	this highlights the critical need for targeted , cost - effective interventions that efficiently address the key psychological factors that can amplify the need for opioids and increased risk for misuse .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	in this trial , the primary goal is to test the comparative efficacy of a single - session skills - based pain management class to a health education active control group among patients with chronic pain who are taking opioids .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	methods / design : our study is a randomized , double - blind clinical trial testing the superiority of our 2-h , singlesession skills - based pain management class against a 2-h health education class .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	we will enroll 136 adult patients with mixed - etiology chronic pain who are taking opioid prescription medication and randomize 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	we hypothesize superiority for the skills - based pain class for pain control , self - regulation of pain - specific distress , and reduced opioid use measured by daily morphine equivalent .

767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	discussion : this study aims to test the utility of a single - session , 2-h skills - based pain management class to improve self - regulation of pain and reduce opioid use .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	findings from our project have the potential to shift current research and clinical paradigms by testing a brief and scalable intervention that could reduce the need for opioids and prevent misuse effectively , efficiently , and economically .
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	further , elucidation of the mechanisms of opioid use can facilitate refinement of more targeted future treatments .

ae61ada1b76945aa2b42ac7cd3ea7695cf6d8fc9	given a dominating set , how much smaller a dominating set can we find through elementary operations ?
ae61ada1b76945aa2b42ac7cd3ea7695cf6d8fc9	here , we proceed by iterative vertex addition and removal while maintaining the property that the set forms a dominating set of bounded size .
ae61ada1b76945aa2b42ac7cd3ea7695cf6d8fc9	this can be seen as the optimization variant of the dominating set reconfiguration problem , where two dominating sets are given and the question is merely whether they can be reached from one another through elementary operations .
ae61ada1b76945aa2b42ac7cd3ea7695cf6d8fc9	we show that this problem is pspace - complete , even if the input graph is a bipartite graph , a split graph , or has bounded pathwidth .
ae61ada1b76945aa2b42ac7cd3ea7695cf6d8fc9	on the positive side , we give linear - time algorithms for cographs , trees and interval graphs .
ae61ada1b76945aa2b42ac7cd3ea7695cf6d8fc9	we also study the parameterized complexity of this problem .
ae61ada1b76945aa2b42ac7cd3ea7695cf6d8fc9	more precisely , we show that the problem is w[2]-hard when parameterized by the upper bound on the size of an intermediary dominating set .

b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	liberal trade policies might increase food supplies but how these policies influence individual - level food insecurity remains uncertain .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	we aimed to assess the association between liberal trade policies and food insecurity at the individual level , and whether this association varies across country - income and household - income groups .

b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	we examined the association between a country 's trade policy score and the probability of individuals reporting moderate - severe or severe food insecurity using regression models and algorithmic weighting procedures .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	we controlled for multiple covariates , including gross domestic product , democratisation level , and population size .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	additionally , we examined heterogeneity by country and household income .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	our sample comprised 460 102 individuals in 132 countries for the period of 2014 - 17 .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	liberal trade policy was not significantly associated with moderate - severe or severe food insecurity after covariate adjustment .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	however , among households in high - income countries with incomes higher than us$ 25 430 per person per year ( adjusted for purchasing power parity ) , a unit increase in the trade policy index ( more liberal ) corresponded to a 0·07 % ( 95 % ci -0·10 to -0·04 )
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	reduction in the predicted probability of reporting moderate - severe food insecurity .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	among households in the lowest income decile ( < $ 450 per person per year ) in low - income countries , a unit increase in the trade policy index was associated with a 0·35 % ( 0·06 to 0·60 ) increase in the predicted probability of reporting moderate - severe food insecurity .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	interpretation
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	the relationship between liberal trade policy and food insecurity varied across countries and households .
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	liberal trade policy was predominantly associated with lower food insecurity in high - income countries but corresponded to increased food insecurity among the world 's poorest households in low - income countries .

c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	using the fret - based enzymatic assay , several inhibitors including boceprevir , gc-376 , and calpain inhibitors ii , and xii were identified to have potent activity with single - digit to submicromolar ic50 values in the enzymatic assay .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	the mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies , thermal shift binding assays , and native mass spectrometry .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	significantly , four compounds ( boceprevir , gc-376 , calpain inhibitors ii and xii ) inhibit sars - cov-2 viral replication in cell culture with ec50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 µm. notably , boceprevir , calpain inhibitors ii and xii represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known m pro inhibitors .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	a complex crystal structure of sars - cov-2 m pro with gc-376 , determined at 2.15 å resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit , revealed two unique binding configurations , shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by m pro .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	overall , the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of sars - cov-2 therapeutics .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	inhibitors as sar - cov-2 antivirals .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	the m pro plays an essential role in coronavirus replication by digesting the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites , and it appears like a high profile target for antiviral drug discovery .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	9 - 12 the m pro has an unique substrate preference for glutamine at the p1 site ( leu - gln(ser , ala , gly ) ) , a feature that is absent in closely related host proteases , suggesting it is feasible to achieve high selectivity by targeting viral m pro .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	as such , we developed the fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret)-based enzymatic assay for the sars - cov-2 m pro and applied it to screen a focused library of protease inhibitors .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	here we report our findings of several novel hits targeting sars - cov-2 m pro and their mechanism of action .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	the in vitro antiviral activity of the hits was also evaluated in cell culture using infectious sars - cov-2 virus .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	overall , our study provides a list of drug candidates for sars - cov-2 with a confirmed mechanism of action , and the results might help speed up the drug discovery efforts in combating covid-19 .
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	the compounds identified herein represent one of the most potent and selective sars - cov-2 m pro inhibitors so far with both enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity .

2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	however , recent models show that short sample - to - answer turnaround time will be a critical property of effective screening strategies ( larremore et al . , 2020 ) .
2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	here , we describe an rt - lamp test for sars - cov-2 in raw saliva that takes about 45 minutes from sample to answer and requires only simple equipment ( pipettes and a heating source ) .
2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	the assay has a limit of detection of 100 virions per microliter , and targets two separate regions of the sars - cov-2 genome .
2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	by combining rapid sample - to - answer turnaround time with the use of saliva , our rt - lamp assay provides a low - complexity , portable , and robust system for real - time community screening .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the covid-19 pandemic is controversial , though increasingly recommended , and the potential of this intervention is not well understood .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	we develop a compartmental model for assessing the communitywide impact of mask use by the general , asymptomatic public , a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	model simulations , using data relevant to covid-19 dynamics in the us states of new york and washington , suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of covid-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	moreover , mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness ( as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked ) and coverage rate ( as a fraction of the general population ) , while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes ( death , hospitalizations ) is highly nonlinear , indicating masks could synergize with other non - pharmaceutical measures .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	notably , masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	hypothetical mask adoption scenarios , for washington and new york state , suggest that immediate near universal ( 80 % ) adoption of moderately ( 50 % )
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	effective masks could prevent on the order of 17 - 45 % of projected deaths over two months in new york , while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34 - 58 % , absent other changes in epidemic dynamics .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	even very weak masks ( 20 % effective )
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing :
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	in washington , where baseline transmission is much less intense , 80 % adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24 - 65 % ( and peak deaths 15 - 69 % ) , compared to 2 - 9 % mortality reduction in new york ( peak death reduction 9 - 18 % ) .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic .
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	the community - wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non - pharmaceutical practices ( such as social - distancing ) , and when adoption is nearly universal ( nation - wide ) and compliance is high .

0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	furthermore , 7 new synthesized benzoselenoxanthene analogues were found to enable stabilizing such g - quadruplex .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	more importantly , compounds can down - regulate tmprss2 gene expression , especially endogenous tmprss2 protein levels , and consequently suppress influenza a virus propagation in vitro .

0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	ha is synthesized as a fusion - inactive precursor ( ha0 ) that could be cleaved into ha1 and ha2 fragments .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	the cleavage of ha0 is a necessary step for influenza virus to be contagious , as it liberates the fusion peptide which can insert into target membranes during fusion .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	on the other hand , the cleavage leads ha to be in a metastable conformation that can undergo the structural rearrangements required for fusion in endosome environment .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	however , iav has no ha0 processing protease ,
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	cleavage of the ha0 is primarily accomplished by the host cellular proteases 5 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	accumulating evidences suggest that , tmprss2 , a type ii transmembrane serine protease , is responsible for ha0 proteolytic cleavage of many subtype iavs which contain a single arginine in the linker peptide between ha1 and ha2 , such as h1n1 ( a / pr/8/34 ) and h7n9 ( a / anhui/1/13 ) 6,7 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	in animal models , tmprss2 deficiency protects mice against h1n1 ( a / pr/8/34 ) , mouse - adapted h1n1 ( a / california/04/09 ) and h7n9 ( a/ anhui/1/13 ) influenza a virus infections 6,7 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	genetic variants with higher tmprss2 expression confer higher risk to severe h1n1 ( pdm09 ) and asian h7n9 influenza a virus 8 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	furthermore , knocking out tmprss2 in mice does not cause any obvious phenotypic abnormality , such as death , infertility or visible sickness 9 .
0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	in addition , more recently , it is reported that tmprss2 can help sars - cov-2 for entry into host cells through entailing s protein cleavage 10 .

0344fca521131d043236ae7f3302e44568bf5f06	in the present study , we demonstrated that a guanine - rich tract of human tmprss2 promoter , located 90 to 118 nucleotide upstream of the transcription start site , was important for promoter activity and capable of forming intramolecular g - quadruplex , a noncanonical four - stranded dna secondary structure that is comprised of two or more self - stack guanines quartets and was considered to be involved in regulation of gene transcription 11 - 13 .

7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	the recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov-2 ) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt public health actions .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	currently , several quantitative reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qrt - pcr )
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	assays are being used by clinical , research , and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	however , it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	our goal was to evaluate the primer - probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the world health organization ( who ) website .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	to facilitate this effort , we generated rna transcripts to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	we then used these rna transcript standards , full - length sars - cov-2 rna , and rna - spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer - probe sets .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	we show that all primer - probe sets can be used to detect sars - cov-2 , but there are clear differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives with low amounts of virus .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	adding to this , many primer - probe sets , including the " n2 " and " n3 " sets issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention , have background amplification with sars - cov-2-negative nasopharyngeal swabs , which may lead to inconclusive results .
7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	our findings characterize the limitations of commonly used primer - probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of sars - cov-2 .

6197ad8a64b3fdbb868d76995338e8c85350beac	recent policy documents position engineering as a way to broaden participation for students in stem fields .
6197ad8a64b3fdbb868d76995338e8c85350beac	however , a recent review of the literature on engineering education found that fewer than 1 % of reviewed articles focused on issues of equity and broadening participation .
6197ad8a64b3fdbb868d76995338e8c85350beac	for this reason , there are few frameworks to build on when designing for equitable engineering instruction in k-12 settings .
6197ad8a64b3fdbb868d76995338e8c85350beac	diversifying participation in engineering means that we need to not just bring learners into existing engineering practices , structures , and ways of knowing , but that we take a critical look at the field of engineering education and challenge researchers and educators to create learning opportunities that build on diverse ways of knowing about engineering and being engineers in the world , with a focus on relating course materials to learners ' everyday lives .
6197ad8a64b3fdbb868d76995338e8c85350beac	in this paper , we leverage the diverse histories , epistemologies , and ways of knowing in engineering to outline the possibilities for learners to critically engage with engineering in k-12 settings
6197ad8a64b3fdbb868d76995338e8c85350beac	and we ask the question , " how can we design learning environments to help students critically understand the intrinsic and systemic sociotechnical relationships between people , communities , and the built environment ?
6197ad8a64b3fdbb868d76995338e8c85350beac	" to answer this question , we propose an instructional framework for developing learners ' critical sociotechnical literacy , which is a place - based approach for critically engaging learners in understanding the impacts of engineering and technology on their own communities and everyday lives in order to restory these spaces for a more equitable and just future .
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) is a highly infectious , rapidly progressive , emerging disease .
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	early diagnosis and preventive measures are key for treatment and minimization of secondary spread .
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	in the context of the armed forces , aggressive containment measures are essential to prevent an outbreak .
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	in this study , we present the first reported case , to our knowledge , of sars in a naval diver .
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	the special physical requirements for divers and the potential complications associated with deep sea diving necessitate extensive investigation before certification of fitness for diving after sars .
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	in the early recovery period , potential problems during diving are caused by inadequate lung ventilation in relation to exercise level and increased breathing resistance attributable to weak respiratory muscles , with corresponding risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia , as well as decreased ability to respond to nonrespiratory problems during diving .
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	problems in the late recovery period include increased risk of diving complications ( such as pulmonary barotrauma ) resulting from fibrosis and scarring within the lung parenchyma , which are known complications of sars .
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	from our experience , we suggest that computed tomographic scans of the thorax , lung function tests , and careful follow - up monitoring should play a vital role in the assessment of patients during the convalescent period , before certification of fitness to dive .

20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	the leaves of lagerstroemia speciosa ( lythraceae ) , a southeast asian tree more commonly known as banaba , have been traditionally consumed in various forms by philippinos for treatment of diabetes and kidney related diseases .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	in the 1990s , the popularity of this herbal medicine began to attract the attention of scientists worldwide .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	since then , researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	using tumor cells as a cell model , corosolic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	more recently , a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	the ellagitannin lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	in a different approach , using 3t3-l1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method , chen et al .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin - like glucose transport inducing activity .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	coupling hplc fractionation with a glucose uptake assay , gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity , not corosolic acid .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	penta - o - galloyl - glucopyranose ( pgg ) was identified as the most potent gallotannin .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	a comparison of published data with results obtained for pgg indicates that pgg has a significantly higher glucose transport stimulatory activity than lagerstroemin .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	chen
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	et al . have also shown that pgg exhibits anti - adipogenic properties in addition to stimulating the glucose uptake in adipocytes .
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	the combination of glucose uptake and anti - adipogenesis activity is not found in the current insulin mimetic drugs and may indicate a great therapeutic potential of pgg .
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	the covid-19 imposed lockdown has led to a number of temporary environmental side effects ( reduced global emissions , cleaner air , less noise ) , that the climate community has aspired to achieve over a number of decades .
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	however , these benefits have been achieved at a massive cost to welfare and the economy .
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	this commentary draws lessons from the covid-19 crisis for climate change .
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	it discusses whether there are more sustainable ways of achieving these benefits , as part of a more desirable , low carbon resilient future , in a more planned , inclusive and less disruptive way .
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	in order to achieve this , we argue for a clearer social contract between citizens and the state .
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	we discuss how covid-19 has demonstrated that behaviours can change abruptly , that these changes come at a cost , that we need a ' social mandate ' to ensure these changes remain in the long - term , and that science plays an important role in informing this process .
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	we suggest that deliberative engagement mechanisms , such as citizens ' assemblies and juries , could be a powerful way to build a social mandate for climate action post - covid-19 .
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	this would enable behaviour changes to become more accepted , embedded and bearable in the long - term and provide the basis for future climate action .

de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	since breast feeding protects the newborns against several infectious diseases , milk from sows fed with oat could improve the health of piglets .
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	abstract :
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	the objectives of this study were to ( i ) investigate the impact of feeding oat on the population of bifidobacteria and ( ii )
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	evaluate their probiotic potential .
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	in this study , we investigated the effects of supplementing sows ' gestation and lactation feed with 15 % oat ( prebiotic source ) on the levels of probiotic population in milk .
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	we found that dietary inclusion of oat during lactation and gestation resulted in increased levels of bifidobacteria compared to lactobacilli in sow milk .
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	furthermore bifidobacteria within the sow
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	milk samples were further evaluated for probiotic potential based on aggregating properties , and acid - and bile - tolerance after exposure to hydrochloric acid ( ph 2.5 ) and bile salts ( 0 % , 0.25 % , 0.50 % , 1.0 % and 2.0 % ) .
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	all isolates survived under the condition of low ph and bile 2.0 % .
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	autoaggregation ability ranged from 17.5 % to 73 % .
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	these isolates also showed antimicrobial activity against e. coli o157 : h7 .
de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	together our results suggest that inclusion of oat in feeding systems could have the potential to improve the intestinal health of piglets by increasing the population of bifidobacteria .

bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	some viruses may be secreted into milk -others may be contaminants .
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	the effect of thermal pasteurization on viruses in hm has yet to be rigorously reviewed .
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	the objective of this study is to characterize the effect of commonly used pasteurization techniques on viruses in hm and non - hm matrices .
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	databases ( medline , embase , web of science ) were searched from inception to april 20 th , 2020 for primary research articles assessing the impact of pasteurization on viral load or detection of live virus .
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	reviews were excluded , as were studies lacking quantitative measurements or those assessing pasteurization as a component of a larger process .
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	overall , 65,131 reports were identified , and 108 studies included .
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	pasteurization of hm at a minimum temperature of 56ºc-60ºc is effective at reducing detectable live virus .
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	in cell culture media or plasma , coronaviruses ( e.g. , sars - cov , sars - cov-2 , mers ) are highly susceptible to heating at ≥ 56ºc.
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	although pasteurization parameters and matrices reported vary , all viruses studied , with the exception of parvoviruses , were susceptible to thermal killing .
bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	future research important for the study of novel viruses should standardize pasteurization protocols and should test viral inactivation using a human milk matrix .

37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	we study the dynamics of epidemics in a networked metapopulation model .
37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	in each subpopulation , representing a locality , disease propagates according to a modified susceptible - exposedinfected - recovered ( seir ) dynamics .
37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	we assume that individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities .
37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	the susceptible and exposed ( pre - symptomatic and infectious ) individuals are allowed to travel between localities undetected .
37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	to investigate the combined effects of mobility and contact reduction on disease progression within interconnected localities , we consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of undetected pre - symptomatic individuals .
37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	we associate the behavior change at the disease - importing locality due to the outbreak size at the origin with the level of preparedness of the locality .
37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	our results show that restricting mobility is valuable if the importing locality is increasing its level of preparedness with respect to the outbreak size at the origin .
37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	moreover , increased levels of preparedness can yield lower total outbreak size by further reducing the outbreak size at the importing locality , even when the response at the origin is weak .
37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	our results highlight that public health decisions on social distancing at localities with less severe outbreaks should strongly account for potential impact of neighbouring localities with a poor response to the outbreak rather than localities with successful responses .

68cc9cab4dba8749ec119008dac426ad4c6f6746	we included five national guidelines that were published in english from canada , the united kingdom , australia , new zealand , and australia health agencies .
68cc9cab4dba8749ec119008dac426ad4c6f6746	fbg , a1c , rpg were recommended as alternative tests instead of a 2hour oral glucose tolerance test ( oggt ) for gdm screening at 24 - 28 weeks of gestation .
68cc9cab4dba8749ec119008dac426ad4c6f6746	recommendations also included a deferral of postpartum screening till the end of the pandemic , or postponement of testing to 6 - 12 months after delivery , use telemedicine and telecare .
68cc9cab4dba8749ec119008dac426ad4c6f6746	conclusions :
68cc9cab4dba8749ec119008dac426ad4c6f6746	updated temporary changes in clinical guidelines are sensible and accommodates social distancing and minimizes risk of exposure to covid-19 .
68cc9cab4dba8749ec119008dac426ad4c6f6746	despite many unsolved controversies in screening , treatment , and follow - up of gestational diabetes , it seems involvement with novel coronavirus have made a reach to a global agreement simpler .

7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	the covid-19 pandemic has affected the entire world , but there are wide variations in prevalence and mortality across nations .
7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	genetic variants which influence behavioural or immune responses to pathogens , selected for by pathogen pressure , may influence this variability .
7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	two relevant polymorphisms in this context are the s allele of the serotonin transporter promoter ( 5-httlpr ) and the g allele of the interleukin-6 gene ( il-6 rs1800795 ) .
7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	methods :
7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	the frequencies of the 5-httlpr s allele and
7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	il-6 rs1800795 g allele were obtained from published data .
7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	the correlations between these allele frequencies and the prevalence and mortality rates of covid-19 were examined across 44 nations .
7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	the il-6 rs1800795 g allele was negatively correlated with covid-19 prevalence ( ρ = -0.466 , p < 0.01 ) and mortality ( ρ = -0.591 , p<0.001 ) across nations .
7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	the 5-httlpr s allele was negatively correlated with covid-19 mortality rates ( ρ = -0.437 , p = 0.023 ) .

5c80af2a5bc7251e2666ea2e6c3b3e8ec527cf2a	this research was based on utilising a dietary intervention method as a means of addressing the problem of managing obesity and overweight .
5c80af2a5bc7251e2666ea2e6c3b3e8ec527cf2a	the dietary intervention program was done for a period of ten weeks .

5c80af2a5bc7251e2666ea2e6c3b3e8ec527cf2a	this work investigates the applicability of machine learning to improve on the prediction of body weight in a dietary intervention program .
5c80af2a5bc7251e2666ea2e6c3b3e8ec527cf2a	models that were utilised include dynamic model , machine learning models ( linear regression , support vector machine ( svm ) , random forest ( rf ) , artificial neural networks ( ann ) ) .
5c80af2a5bc7251e2666ea2e6c3b3e8ec527cf2a	the performance of these estimation models was compared based on evaluation metrics like rmse , mae and r2 .

6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	time and again , many organizations and their staff members must respond to unexpected catastrophes like hurricanes ( e.g. , katrina ) , virus pandemics ( e.g. , covid-19 ) , or other major emergencies .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	as a result , some organizations allow their employees to respond to external emergencies by engaging in response actions for a limited time , like in the case of emergency response teams .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	the latter teams consist of employees that act as emergency response officers who can respond to floods , train crashes , or other emergencies .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	emergency response teams constitute an example of so - called latent organizing ( lo ) in the preparation for and response to any ( unpredictable ) future emergency .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	while latent organizing is ubiquitous in a societal and professional sense , it has hardly been studied in the organization design literature .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	in this paper , we develop a research agenda for studying lo .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	lo serves to prepare for and respond to emergencies , but otherwise remains largely dormant and inactive .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	when it is inactive , host organizations use the lo 's human and other resources for their own gainful purposes .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	resources for lo are thus organized in a quasi - permanent fashion , one that is rather latent until activated by an emergency .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	we further develop the construct of latency to explore how effective lo can be designed and facilitated .
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	in addition , we develop a research agenda for future work in this area .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	covid-19 pandemic has increased significantly to mortality in many countries with the number of infected cases increasing exponentially worldwide .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	one of the main determining factors of the poor prognosis in these patients is the development of coagulopathy .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	moreover , it is well known that art procedures confer a risk of thromboembolic complications .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	in this commentary we analize specific coexisting aspects between the thrombotic risk described during virus infection and that one reported in the context of assisted reproduction treatments .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	based on known pathophysiological aspects of both virus infection and those identified during ovarian stimulation ( os ) , we found common elements that deserve to be taken into account .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	in the present context , any risk of hyperstimulation should be avoided .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	gnrh agonist triggering should be mandatory in high responders patients and/or with covid infection .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	in both cases , the cycle should be segmented .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	we propose prophylactic with low molecular weigth heparin ( lmwh ) not only in those cases in which the oocyte recovery has been performed , but also in those in which the cancellation has been decided .
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	in addition , the endometrial preparation to the frozen - thawed embryo transfers ( fets ) should be using the transdermal route in order to minimize the higher thrombotic risk of the oral route .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	acute gastroenteritis accounts for a significant burden of medically attended illness in children under the age of five .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	for this study , four multiplex reverse transcription pcr assays were used to determine the incidence of adenovirus , astrovirus , coronavirus , norovirus gi and gii , rotavirus , and sapovirus in stool samples submitted for viral electron microscopy ( em ) to the children 's hospital colorado .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	of 1105 stool samples available , viral rna / dna was detected in 247 ( 26.2 % ) of 941 pediatric samples ( median age ¼ 2.97 years , 54 % male ) with 28 ( 3.0 % ) positive for more than one virus .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	adenovirus , astrovirus , norovirus gi , norovirus gii , rotavirus , and sapovirus were detected in 95 ( 10.0 % ) , 33 ( 3.5 % ) , 8 ( 0.9 % ) , 90 ( 9.6 % ) , 49 ( 5.2 % ) , and 2 ( 0.2 % ) of the pediatric samples , respectively .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	no coronaviruses were identified .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	sequencing of norovirus positive samples indicated an outbreak of norovirus strain gii.4 in 2006 with evidence of numerous circulating strains .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	multiple samples from the same immunocompromised patients demonstrated symptomatic shedding of norovirus for up to 32 weeks and astrovirus for 12 weeks .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	rt - pcr detected 99 of 111 ( 89 % )
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	adenovirus - positive samples versus 12 ( 11 % ) by em , and 186 of 192 ( 97 % )
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	sapovirus / astrovirus/ norovirus - positive samples versus 21 ( 11 % ) by em .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	noroviruses and adenoviruses are common causes of gastroenteritis in children .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	immunocompromised patients can be infected with multiple viruses and shed viruses in their stools for prolonged periods .
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	this data support the superiority of rt - pcr compared to em for diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	in multiple sclerosis lesions , remyelination typically fails with repeated or chronic demyelinating episodes and results in neurologic disability .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	in the current study , we used a mouse model of chronic demyelination induced by continuous ingestion of 0.2 % cuprizone for 12 weeks .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	this chronic process depleted the oligodendrocyte progenitor population and impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	remyelination remained limited after removal of cuprizone from the diet .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	fibroblast growth factor 2 ( fgf2 ) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	we used fgf2 j / j mice to determine whether removal of endogenous fgf2 promoted remyelination of chronically demyelinated areas .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	wild - type and fgf2
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	j / j mice exhibited similar demyelination during chronic cuprizone treatment .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	importantly , in contrast to wild - type mice , the fgf2 j / j mice spontaneously remyelinated completely during the recovery period after chronic demyelination .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	increased remyelination in fgf2 j / j mice correlated with enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	fgf2 genotype did not alter the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or proliferating cells after chronic demyelination .
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	these findings indicate that attenuating fgf2 created a sufficiently permissive lesion environment for endogenous cells to effectively remyelinate viable axons even after chronic demyelination .

8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	1 -acid glycoprotein ( fagp ) increases during feline infectious peritonitis ( fip ) .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	we have recently identified a 29 kda protein that we named feline agp - related protein ( fagprp ) due to its cross - reactivity with an anti - human agp monoclonal antibody .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	in this work we describe the tissue distribution of fagprp during fip , and its relationship with feline coronavirus ( fcov ) and myeloid cells .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	tissues from five control cats and from 15 cats with fip were examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against human agp , fcov and myeloid antigens .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	diffuse fagprp positivity within the lesions , likely due to vascular plasma leakage , endothelial and epithelial lining were detectable .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	compared to controls , fagprp - expressing cells often increased in number and were diffusely distributed in lymph nodes , as usually occurs for igm - producing plasma cells during early immune responses .
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	these findings did not depend on the presence of fcovs or of myeloid cells , suggesting that fagprp is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of fip .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	astrocytes isolated from the brain of newborn lewis rats and an astrocytic cell line were susceptible to infection with the neurotropic borna disease virus in vitro .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	since astrocytes also have been found to be infected in vivo it seemed appropriate to test this cell type for interaction with a borna disease virus - specific cd 4 + t cell line .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	borna disease virus - infected astrocytes were found to be capable of presenting virus - specific antigen to virus - specific t cells in vitro .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	however , the response was significantly enhanced if the purified 38/39 kda borna disease virus - specific protein was added exogenously to the cultures .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	beside the function as antigen - presenting cells for various antigens including virus - specific protein and myelin basic protein , persistently infected astrocytes were also found to act as target cells for a cd 4 + t cell line as shown in conventional 51cr release assays after induction of mhc class ii expression by gamma interferon .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	infection of astrocytes alone did not cause expression of this self antigen .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	it could be shown that the ability of cd 4 + bdv - specific t cells to mediate lysis was in part dependent on the stage of activation .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	lymphocytes " activated " before testing exerted high lysis after only 4 h of coincubation with target cells , whereas " resting " t cells did not cause significant lysis until 12h of coincubation .
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	the dependence of the interaction between effector and target cells on mhc class ii antigen was demonstrated by the finding that antibodies to
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	ia antigens reduced lysis of target cells .

843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	the approach is featured with a continuity equation being explicitly solved for water vapor , which allows comprehensively considering the effects of inhomogeneous humidity field on droplets evaporation and movement .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	the computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) computations based on the approach achieved a satisfactory agreement with the theoretical models reported in the literature .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	the results demonstrated that the evaporation - generated vapor and super - saturated wet air exhaled from the respiratory tracks forms a " vapor plume " in front of the respiratory track opening , which , despite the short life time , significantly impedes the evaporation of the droplets captured in it .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	the study also revealed that due to the droplet size reduction induced by evaporation , both the number density of airborne droplets and mass concentration of inhalable pathogens remarkably increased , which can result in a higher risk of infection .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	parametric studies were finally conducted to evaluate the factors affecting droplet evaporation .
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	summary :
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	the study demonstrated the importance of considering inhomogeneous humidity field when modelling the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets .

39a1163f47ecb0d167b9e051ebc69814bb7676ea	detection of early infectious disease may be challenging due to the low copy number of organisms present .
39a1163f47ecb0d167b9e051ebc69814bb7676ea	to overcome this limitation and rapidly measure low concentrations of the pathogen , we developed a novel technology : nanotrap particles , which are designed to capture , concentrate , and protect biomarkers from complex biofluids .
39a1163f47ecb0d167b9e051ebc69814bb7676ea	nanotrap particles are thermoresponsive hydrogels that are capable of antigen capture through the coupling of affinity baits to the particles .

46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	twenty - four field isolates of transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) were isolated and examined for antigenic and biological characteristics .
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	most tgev isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect ( cpe ) in swine testis ( st ) cell culture , which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected ceils from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident .
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	minor variations in cpe were observed with one isolate , ia-145 .

793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	sars - cov-2 , a member of the coronavirus family , has caused a global public health emergency .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	1
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	based on our analysis of hepatitis c virus and coronavirus replication , and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors , we previously reasoned that the fda - approved heptatitis c drug epclusa ( sofosbuvir / velpatasvir ) should inhibit coronaviruses , including sars - cov-2 .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	2
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	here , using model polymerase extension experiments , we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of sofosbuvir is incorporated by low - fidelity polymerases and sars - cov rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) , and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases ; the activated triphosphate form of sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host - like high - fidelity dna polymerase .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	using the same molecular insight , we selected two other anti - viral agents , alovudine and azt ( an fda approved hiv / aids drug ) for evaluation as inhibitors of sars - cov rdrp .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	we demonstrate the ability of two hiv reverse transcriptase inhibitors , 3'fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate ( the active triphosphate forms of alovudine and azt ) , to be incorporated by sars - cov rdrp where they also terminate further polymerase extension .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	given the 98 % amino acid similarity of the sars - cov and sars - cov-2 rdrps , we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the sars - cov-2 polymerase .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	these results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad - spectrum anticoronavirus agents .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the recent appearance of a new coronaviral infection , covid-19 , in wuhan , china , and its worldwide spread , has made international headlines .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	already more than 3,000 deaths have been ascribed to this virus , and covid-19 has reached near pandemic status .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia , sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	1
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the virus , designated sars - cov-2 , is a new member of the subgenus sarbecovirus , in the orthocoronavirinae subfamily , but is distinct from mers - cov and sars - cov. 1
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the coronaviruses are single strand rna viruses , sharing properties with other single - stranded rna viruses such as hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) , west nile virus , marburg virus , hiv virus , ebola virus , dengue virus , and rhinoviruses .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	in particular , coronaviruses and hcv are both positive - sense single - strand rna viruses , 3,4 and thus have a similar replication mechanism requiring a rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	the coronavirus life cycle has been described .

793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	briefly , the virus enters the cell by endocytosis , is uncoated , and orf1a and orf1b of the positive strand rna is translated to produce nonstructural protein precursors , including a cysteine protease and a serine protease ; these further cleave the precursors to form mature , functional helicase and rna - dependent rna polymerase .
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	a replication - transcription complex is then
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	proteolytical cleavage of the picornaviral polyprotein is essential for viral replication .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	therefore , viral proteases are attractive targets for anti - viral therapy .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	most assays available for testing proteolytical activity of proteases are performed in vitro , using heterologously expressed proteases and peptide substrates .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	to deal with the disadvantages associated with in vitro assays , we modified a cell - based protease assay for picornavirus proteases .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	the assay is based on the induction of expression of a firefly luciferase reporter by a chimeric transcription factor in which the viral protease and cleavage sites are inserted between the gal4 binding domain and the vp16 activation domain .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	firefly luciferase expression is dependent on cleavage of the transcription factor by the viral protease .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	this biosafe assay enables testing the effect of compounds on protease activity in cells while circumventing the need for infection .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	we designed the assay for 3c proteases ( 3c pro ) of various enteroviruses as well as of viruses of several other picornavirus genera , and show that the assay is amenable for use in a high - throughput setting .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	furthermore , we show that the spectrum of activity of 3c pro inhibitor ag7088 ( rupintrivir ) not only encompasses enterovirus 3c pro but also 3c pro of foot - and - mouth disease virus ( fmdv ) , an aphthovirus .
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	in contrary , ag7404 ( compound 1 ) , an analogue of ag7088 , had no effect on fmdv 3c pro activity , for which we provide a structural explanation .

7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	a b s t r a c t prrsv is the causative agent of the most important infectious disease affecting swine herds worldwide , producing great economic losses .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	commercially available vaccines are only partially effective in protection against prrsv .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	moreover , modified live vaccines may allow virus shedding , and could revert generating virulent phenotypes .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	therefore , new efficient vaccines are required .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	vaccines based on recombinant virus genomes ( virus vectored vaccines ) against prrsv could represent a safe alternative for the generation of modified live vaccines .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	in this paper , current vectored vaccines to protect against prrsv are revised , including those based on pseudorabies virus , poxvirus , adenovirus , and virus replicons .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	special attention has been provided to the use of transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) as vector for the expression of prrsv antigens .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	this vector has the capability of expressing high levels of heterologous genes , is a potent interferon- ␣ inducer , and presents antigens in mucosal surfaces , eliciting both secretory and systemic immunity .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	a tgev derived vector ( rtgev ) was generated , expressing prrsv wild type or modified gp5 and m proteins , described as the main inducers of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response , respectively .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	protection experiments showed that vaccinated animals developed a faster and stronger humoral immune response than the non - vaccinated ones .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	partial protection in challenged animals was observed , as vaccinated pigs showed decreased lung damage when compared with the non - vaccinated ones .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	nevertheless , the level of neutralizing antibodies was low , what may explain the limited protection observed .
7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	several strategies are proposed to improve current rtgev vectors expressing prrsv antigens .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	antisense antimicrobial therapeutics are synthetic oligomers that silence expression of specific genes .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	this specificity confers an advantage over broad - spectrum antibiotics by avoiding unintended effects on commensal bacteria .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	the sequence - specificity and short length of antisense antimicrobials also pose little risk to human gene expression .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	because antisense antimicrobials are a platform technology , they can be rapidly designed and synthesized to target almost any microbe .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	this reduces drug discovery time , and provides flexibility and a rational approach to drug development .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	recent work has shown that antisense technology has the potential to address the antibiotic - resistance crisis , since resistance mechanisms for standard antibiotics apparently have no effect on antisense antimicrobials .
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	here , we describe current reports of antisense antimicrobials targeted against viruses , parasites , and bacteria .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	using a standard cellular fusion technique and indirect enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) , a hybridoma cell line strain secreting anti - hbs monoclonal antibody ( mab )
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	( defined g6 mab ) was obtained .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	the cells grew and secreted mab stably .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	antibody titers in the culture supernatant and ascites were 2.048 â10 6 and 4.096 â10 6 , respectively .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	by applying the anti - hbs g6 mab and horseradish peroxidase ( hrp)-labeled goat anti - hbs antibody , we developed a sandwich elisa ( defined g6 m elisa ) for detecting both wild - type and immune escape mutant hbsags ( iem hbsag ) .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	the assay was performed to detect 17 species of genome recombinant expression hbsag , including two wild - type species and 15 iem hbsag species , which varied in the " a " determinant , in a group of patients infected with hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	the patients previously had a lower elisa detection signal [ ( absorbance of patients / absorbance of normal people ( p / n ) : 1.0 - 4.5 ) ] .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	the results demonstrated that the sensitivity of this assay to wild - type hbsag was
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	no less than 0.125 μg / l ; 12 of 15 iem hbsag species ( p / n≥2.5 ) were positive for g6 mab .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	of the positive iem hbsag species , two had a low absorbance value at 450 nm ( a 450 ) , one had an intermediate a 450 value and nine had a high a 450 value , which was 7.55%(mean ) ,
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	59.4 % and 92.1%-109.4 % of the wild - type a 450 value , respectively .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	the two species with low a 450 value and the three negative species mutated at the bases 120 - 124 in the first loop of the hbv " a " determinant .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	using the g6 elisa and two commercial elisa kits ( a and b ) , 177 patients were tested .
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	the g6 elisa had a significantly higher detection rate than either commercial elisas ( 19.21 % vs 14.89 % and 6.21 % , respectively ; p < 0.01 , p < 0.05 , respectively ) .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	background :
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	measles is a highly infectious viral disease .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	in august 2017 , lyantonde district , uganda reported a measles outbreak to uganda ministry of health .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	we investigated the outbreak to assess the scope , factors facilitating transmission , and recommend control measures .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	methods :
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	we defined a probable case as sudden onset of fever and generalized rash in a resident of lyantonde , lwengo , or rakai districts from 1 june-30 september 2017 , plus ≥1 of the following : coryza , conjunctivitis , or cough .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	a confirmed case was a probable case with serum positivity of measles - specific igm. we conducted a neighborhood - and age - matched case - control study to identified exposure factors , and used conditional logistic regression to analyze the data .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	we estimated vaccine effectiveness and vaccination coverage .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	results :
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	we identified 81 cases ( 75 probable , 6 confirmed ) ; 4 patients ( 4.9 % ) died .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	in the case - control study , 47 % of case - patients and 2.3 % of controls were hospitalized at lyantonde hospital pediatric department for non - measles conditions 7 - 21 days before case - patient 's onset ( or adj = 34 , 95%ci : 5.1 - 225 ) .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	estimated vaccine effectiveness was 95 % ( 95%ci : 75 - 99 % ) and vaccination coverage was 76 % ( 95%ci : 68 - 82 % ) .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	during the outbreak , an " isolation " ward was established inside the general pediatric ward where there was mixing of both measles and non - measles patients .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	conclusions :
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	this outbreak was amplified by nosocomial transmission and facilitated by low vaccination coverage .
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	we recommended moving the isolation ward outside of the building , supplemental vaccination , and vaccinating pediatric patients during measles outbreaks .

fa9c04042eb022318e0b33c2107240768f47eab8	thus far there is no convincing evidence that any disease - modifying anti - rheumatic drug ( conventional synthetic , biologic or targeted synthetic ) including hydroxychloroquine , may protect against severe covid-19 infection ; answers about their possible usefulness in the management of the cytokine storm associated with severe covid-9 infection will only arise from ongoing randomized controlled trials .
fa9c04042eb022318e0b33c2107240768f47eab8	evidence on covid-19 risk and outcome in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases is extremely limited ; thus , any conclusions would be unsafe and should be seen with great caution .
fa9c04042eb022318e0b33c2107240768f47eab8	at present , the risk and severity ( hospitalization , intensive care unit admission and death ) of covid-19 infection in people with autoimmune diseases do not appear particularly dissimilar to the general population , with the possible exception of hospitalization in patients exposed to high glucocorticoid doses .
fa9c04042eb022318e0b33c2107240768f47eab8	at this stage it is impossible to draw any conclusions for differences in covid-19 risk and outcome between different autoimmune diseases and between the various immunomodulatory therapies used for them .

61c89f680da08c45e908d33555a5701cadb4c1c6	the solar system is littered , however , with distorted polyhedra -shards of rock and ice produced by ubiquitous fragmentation .
61c89f680da08c45e908d33555a5701cadb4c1c6	we apply the theory of convex mosaics to show that the average geometry of natural 2d fragments , from mud cracks to earth 's tectonic plates , has two attractors : " platonic " quadrangles and " voronoi " hexagons .
61c89f680da08c45e908d33555a5701cadb4c1c6	in 3d the platonic attractor is dominant : remarkably , the average shape of natural rock fragments is cuboid .
61c89f680da08c45e908d33555a5701cadb4c1c6	when viewed through the lens of convex mosaics , natural fragments are indeed geometric shadows of plato 's forms .
61c89f680da08c45e908d33555a5701cadb4c1c6	simulations show that generic binary breakup drives all mosaics toward the platonic attractor , explaining the ubiquity of cuboid averages .
61c89f680da08c45e908d33555a5701cadb4c1c6	deviations from binary fracture produce more exotic patterns that are genetically linked to the formative stress field .

90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	it is now common for parents to measure tympanic temperatures in children .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	the objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these measurements .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	parents and then nurses measured the temperature of 60 children with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use ( home thermometer ) .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	the reference standard was a temperature measured by a nurse with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals ( hospital thermometer ) .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	a difference of ≥ 0.5 ° c was considered clinically significant .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	a fever was defined as a temperature ≥ 38.5 ° c .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	the mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent and the nurse with the home thermometer was 0.44 ± 0.61 ° c , and 33 % of the readings differed by ≥ 0.5 ° c .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	the mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent with the home thermometer and the nurse with the hospital thermometer was 0.51 ± 0.63 ° c , and 72 % of the readings differed by ≥ 0.5 ° c .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	using the home thermometer , parents detected fever with a sensitivity of 76 % ( 95 % ci 50 - 93 % ) , a specificity of 95 % ( 95 % ci 84 - 99 % ) , a positive predictive value of 87 % ( 95 % ci 60 - 98 % ) , and a negative predictive value of 91 % ( 95 % ci 79 - 98 % ) .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	in comparing the readings the nurse obtained from the two different tympanic thermometers , the mean absolute difference was 0.24 ±
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	0.22 ° c .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	nurses detected fever with a sensitivity of 94 % ( 95 % ci 71 - 100 % ) , a specificity of 88 % ( 95 % ci 75 - 96 % ) , a positive predictive value of 76 % ( 95 % ci 53 - 92 % ) , and a negative predictive value of 97 % ( 95%ci 87 - 100 % ) using the home thermometer .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	the intraclass correlation coefficient for the three sets of readings was 0.80 , and the consistency of readings was not affected by the body temperature .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	the readings done by parents with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use differed a clinically significant amount from the reference standard ( readings done by nurses with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals )
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	the majority of the time , and parents failed to detect fever about one - quarter of the time .
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	tympanic readings reported by parents should be interpreted with great caution .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	rho gtpase - activating proteins ( rhogaps ) have been reported to be of great importance in the initiation and development of many different cancers .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	however , their biological roles and regulatory mechanisms in lung cancer development and progression are poorly defined .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	real - time pcr or western blotting analysis was used to detect rho gtpase - activating protein 24 ( arhgap24 ) , wwp2 , p27 , p - stat6 and stat6 expression levels as well as the activity of rhoa and rac1 in lung cancer .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	cell proliferation , apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by cck-8 and flow cytometry analysis .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	tumor growth of lung cancer cells was measured using a nude mouse xenograft experiment model in vivo .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	the correlation between wwp2 and p27 was measured by co - immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analysis .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	we found that arhgap24 expression was lower in lung cancer tissues collected from the the cancer genome atlas and independent hospital database .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	overexpression of arhgap24 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and the activity of rhoa and rac1 , induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at the g 0 -g 1 phase .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	arhgap24 overexpression also inhibited tumor growth in nude mice , whereas knockdown of arhgap24 significantly promoted cell proliferation and wwp2 expression and inhibited cell cycle arrest at g 1 phase through activating stat6 signaling .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	arhgap24 overexpression inhibited wwp2 overexpression - induced cell proliferation , cell cycle progression and the decreased p27 expression .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	moreover , wwp2 was found interacted with p27 , and wwp2 overexpression promoted the ubiquitination of p27 .
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	in conclusion , our findings suggest that arhgap24 inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induces cell apoptosis of lung cancer via a stat6-wwp2-p27 axis .

a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) and influenza virus are common causes of infantile lower respiratory tract infection ( lrti ) .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	it is widely believed that both viral replication and inappropriately enhanced immune responses contribute to disease severity .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	in infants , rsv lrti is known to be more severe than influenza virus lrti .

a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	we compared cytokines and chemokines in secretions of infants surviving various forms of respiratory illness caused by rsv or influenza viruses , to determine which mediators were associated with more - severe illness .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	we analyzed lung tissue from infants with fatal cases of rsv and influenza virus lrti to determine the types of inflammatory cells present .

a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	quantities of lymphocyte - derived cytokines were minimal in secretions from infants with rsv infection .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	concentrations of most cytokines were greater in influenza virus , rather than rsv , infection .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	lung tissues from infants with fatal rsv and influenza virus lrti demonstrated an extensive presence of viral antigen and a near absence of cd8-positive lymphocytes and natural killer cells , with marked expression of markers of apoptosis .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	conclusions .
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	severe infantile rsv and influenza virus lrti is characterized by inadequate ( rather than excessive ) adaptive immune responses , robust viral replication , and apoptotic crisis .

4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in december 2019 .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	this respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	severe cases make up to 15 % , lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10 % .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	what is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	during the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung , the ace2 receptor has a central function .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	the antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate ( cq ) and hydroxychloroquine ( hcq ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ace2 without significant change of cell - surface ace2 and , therefore , might be potent inhibitors of sars - cov-2 infections .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	starting inhibition at 0.1 µm , cq completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µm , suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 hours after infection .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	in a first clinical trial , cq was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia , improving lung imaging findings , promotion of virus - negative conversion , and shortening the disease .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	in addition , hcq , which is three times more potent than cq in sars - cov-2 infected cells ( ec50 0.72 µm ) , was significantly associated with viral load reduction / disappearance in covid-19 patients compared to controls .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	theoretically , cq and hcq could thus be effectively used in the treatment of sars - cov pneumonia .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	from a pharmacological standpoint , however , the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	concretely , this relates to ( a )
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells , depending on intestinal resorption , hepatic first - pass metabolism and accumulation in liver , spleen and lung , and ( b ) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1 - 5 µm at the alveolar surface .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	therefore , we propose in a first dose estimation the use of hcq as an aerosol in a dosage of 2 - 4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	by using a low - dose non - systemic aerosol , adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	this increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person , which would be an advantage especially for the high - risk , often multi - morbid and elderly patients .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	empirical data on self - medication with a one - week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented .
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	pulmonary diseases due to mycobacteria cause significant morbidity and mortality to human health .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	in addition to tuberculosis ( tb ) , caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) , recent epidemiological studies have shown the emergence of non - tuberculous mycobacteria ( ntm ) species in causing lung diseases in humans .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	although more than 170 ntm species are present in various environmental niches , only a handful , primarily mycobacterium avium complex and m. abscessus , have been implicated in pulmonary disease .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	while tb is transmitted through inhalation of aerosol droplets containing mtb , generated by patients with symptomatic disease , ntm disease is mostly disseminated through aerosols originated from the environment .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	however , following inhalation , both mtb and ntm are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in the lungs .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	subsequently , various immune cells are recruited from the circulation to the site of infection , which leads to granuloma formation .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	although the pathophysiology of tb and ntm diseases share several fundamental cellular and molecular events , the host - susceptibility to mtb and ntm infections are different .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	striking differences also exist in the disease presentation between tb and ntm cases .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	while ntm disease is primarily associated with bronchiectasis , this condition is rarely a predisposing factor for tb .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	similarly , in human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv)-infected individuals , ntm disease presents as disseminated , extrapulmonary form rather than as a miliary , pulmonary disease , which is seen in mtb infection .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	the diagnostic modalities for tb , including molecular diagnosis and drug - susceptibility testing ( dst ) , are more advanced and possess a higher rate of sensitivity and specificity , compared to the tools available for ntm infections .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	in general , drugsensitive tb is effectively treated with a standard multi - drug regimen containing well - defined first - and second - line antibiotics .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	however , the treatment of drug - resistant tb requires the additional , newer class of antibiotics in combination with or without the first and second - line drugs .
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	in contrast , the ntm species display significant heterogeneity in their susceptibility to standard anti - tb drugs .

6a0f7cfb9306380e01f35d7f8c0e75c0f91dcbc4	this change resulted in weaker cell - cell fusion , smaller plaque morphology , higher virus titer and serious microfilament condensation .
6a0f7cfb9306380e01f35d7f8c0e75c0f91dcbc4	further analysis confirmed that this mutation was responsible for optimal cell - adaptation , but not the determinant for trypsin - dependent entry of pedv .

dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	improved identification of risk factors might enable targeted intervention .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	therefore we carried out a case - control study with the aim of identifying environmental risk factors for arti consultations in the dutch general population .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	a subset of patients visiting their gp in the period of 2000 - 2003 with an arti ( cases ) and age - matched controls ( visiting for other complaints ) were included in a case - control study .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	they were asked to complete a questionnaire about potential risk factors .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio 's ( or ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) to estimate the independent effect of potential risk factors .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	results :
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	a total of 493 matched pairs of case and control subjects were enrolled .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	exposure to persons with respiratory complaints , both inside and outside the household , was found to be an independent risk factor for visiting a gp with an arti ( respectively or adj = 1.9 and or adj = 3.7 ) .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	participants exposed to dampness or mould at home ( or adj = 0.5 ) were significantly less likely to visit their gp .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	in accordance with the general risk of consultations for arti , participants with a laboratory - confirmed arti who were exposed to persons with respiratory complaints outside the household were also significantly more likely to visit their gp ( or adj = 2.5 ) .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	this study confirmed that heterogeneity in the general population as well as in pathogens causing arti makes it complicated to detect associations between potential risk factors and respiratory infections .
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	whereas it may be difficult to intervene on the risk posed by exposure to persons with respiratory complaints , transmission of arti in the general population might be reduced by improved hygienic conditions .

5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pooling specimen for testing of sars - cov-2 virus , to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing .

5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting sars - cov-2 , and the pcr cycle threshold ( ct ) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t - test .
5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	this study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates , ranging from 0.1 - 10 % .
5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	pooling specimens to test for covid-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80 % .
5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	this paves the possibility for large - scale population screening , allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with low incidence of infection , or with lower risk populations .

8e7e144a3c19ba3e020eae3a23b5d18a78bf1441	modeling and simulation of such problems poses an additional challenge of continuously evolving training data in which the model parameters change over time depending upon external factors .
8e7e144a3c19ba3e020eae3a23b5d18a78bf1441	our main contribution is that in a scenario of continuously evolving training data , unlike typical deep learning techniques , this non - intrusive model eliminates the need to retrain or rebuild the model from scratch every time a new training data set is received .
8e7e144a3c19ba3e020eae3a23b5d18a78bf1441	after validating the model , we use it to study the impact of different strategies for epidemic control .
8e7e144a3c19ba3e020eae3a23b5d18a78bf1441	finally , we propose and simulate a strategy of controlled natural immunization through risk based population compartmentalization ( pc ) wherein the population is divided in low risk ( lr ) and high risk ( hr ) compartments based on risk factors ( like comorbidities and age ) and subjected to different disease transmission dynamics by isolating the hr compartment while allowing the lr compartment to develop natural immunity .
8e7e144a3c19ba3e020eae3a23b5d18a78bf1441	upon release from the preventive isolation , the hr compartment finds itself surrounded by enough number of immunized individuals to prevent spread of infection and thus most of the deaths occurring in this group are avoided .

56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections , hundreds of thousands of deaths and major societal disruption due to lockdowns and other restrictions introduced to limit disease spread .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	relatively little attention has been paid to understanding how the pandemic has affected treatment , prevention and control of malaria , which is a major cause of death and disease and predominantly affects people in less well - resourced settings .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	main body :
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	recent successes in malaria control and elimination have reduced the global malaria burden , but these gains are fragile and progress has stalled in the past 5 years .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	withdrawing successful interventions often results in rapid malaria resurgence , primarily threatening vulnerable young children and pregnant women .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	malaria programmes are being affected in many ways by covid-19 .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	for prevention of malaria , insecticide - treated nets need regular renewal , but distribution campaigns have been delayed or cancelled .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	for detection and treatment of malaria , individuals may stop attending health facilities , out of fear of exposure to covid-19 , or because they can not afford transport , and health care workers require additional resources to protect themselves from covid-19 .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	supplies of diagnostics and drugs are being interrupted , which is compounded by production of substandard and falsified medicines and diagnostics .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	these disruptions are predicted to double the number of young african children dying of malaria in the coming year and may impact efforts to control the spread of drug resistance .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	using examples from successful malaria control and elimination campaigns , we propose strategies to re - establish malaria control activities and maintain elimination efforts in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , which is likely to be a long - term challenge .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	all sectors of society , including governments , donors , private sector and civil society organisations , have crucial roles to play to prevent malaria resurgence .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	sparse resources must be allocated efficiently to ensure integrated health care systems that can sustain control activities against covid-19 as well as malaria and other priority infectious diseases .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	conclusion : as we deal with the covid-19 pandemic , it is crucial that other major killers such as malaria are not ignored .
56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	history tells us that if we do , the consequences will be dire , particularly in vulnerable populations .

112a52667f92d8936fababa4b0c9001d3686b043	the epidemic caused by sars - cov-2 was first reported in wuhan , china , and now is spreading worldwide .
112a52667f92d8936fababa4b0c9001d3686b043	the chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of wuhan , establishing multiple temporary hospitals , and prohibiting public gathering events .
112a52667f92d8936fababa4b0c9001d3686b043	here , we constructed a new real - time status dynamic model of seio ( mh ) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in wuhan .
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	previously , we demonstrated that the de072 strain of ibv is a recombinant which has an ibv strain d1466-like sequence in the s gene .
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	herein , we analyzed the remaining 3.8 kb 3 end of the genome , which includes gene 3 , gene 4 , gene 5 , gene 6 , and the 3 non - coding region of the de072 and d1466 strains .
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	those two viruses had high nucleotide similarity in gene 4 .
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	however , the other individual genes had a much different level of sequence similarity with the same gene of the other ibv strains .
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	the genome of five ibv strains , of which the complete sequence of the 3 end of the genome has been determined , were divided at an intergenic ( ig ) consensus sequence ( ctgaacaa or cttaacaa ) and compared phylogenetically .
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	phylogenetic trees of different topology indicated that the consensus ig sequences and the highly conserved sequence around this regions may serve as recombination ' hot spots ' .
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	phylogenetic analysis of selected regions of the genome of the de072 serotype field isolates further support those results and indicate that isolates within the same serotype may have different amounts of nucleotide sequence similarity with each other in individual genes other than the s gene .
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	presumably this occurs because the consensus ig sequence serves as the template switching site for the viral encoded polymerase .

2e4e028545dfdf378169bab94dd081042bcdcfc3	an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia was caused by a novel coronavirus in china in 2019 .
2e4e028545dfdf378169bab94dd081042bcdcfc3	by march 19 , over 200 thousand confirmed cases of sars - cov-2 infection and over 9000 deaths have been reported throughout the world .
2e4e028545dfdf378169bab94dd081042bcdcfc3	for this infectious disease , nucleic acid detection is still the gold standard for pathogenic detection .
2e4e028545dfdf378169bab94dd081042bcdcfc3	however , nucleic acid detection takes a long time and has relatively high " false negative " ; therefore , we need urgently a convenient and accurate detection method to make up for this deficiency .

5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	the hashing - based techniques for approximate counting have emerged as a dominant approach , promising achievement of both scalability and rigorous theoretical guarantees .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	the standard construction of strongly 2universal hash functions employs dense xors
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	( i.e. , involving half of the variables in expectation ) , which is widely known to cause degradation in the runtime performance of state of the art sat solvers .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	consequently , the past few years have witnessed an intense activity in the design of sparse xors as hash functions .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	such constructions have been proposed with beliefs to provide runtime performance improvement along with theoretical guarantees similar to that of dense xors .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	the primary contribution of this paper is a rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis to understand the effect of the sparsity of xors .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	in contradiction to prior beliefs of applicability of analysis for sparse hash functions to all the hashing - based techniques , we prove a contradictory result .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	we show that the best - known bounds obtained for sparse xors are still too weak to yield theoretical guarantees for a large class of hashing - based techniques , including the state of the art approach approxmc3 .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	we then turn to a rigorous empirical analysis of the performance benefits of sparse hash functions .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	to this end , we first design , to the best of our knowledge , the most efficient algorithm called sparsecount2 using sparse hash functions , which achieves at least up to two orders of magnitude performance improvement over its predecessor .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	contradicting the current beliefs , we observe that sparsecount2 still falls short of approxmc3 in runtime performance despite the usage of dense xors in approxmc3 .
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	in conclusion , our work showcases that the question of whether it is possible to use short xors to achieve scalability while providing strong theoretical guarantees is still wide open .

d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	i ifns can influence dendritic cell ( dc ) activation , maturation , migration , and survival , but also directly enhance natural killer ( nk ) and t / b cell activity , thus orchestrating various innate and adaptive immune effector functions .
d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	therefore , type i ifns have long been considered essential in the host defense against virus infections .
d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	more recently , it has become clear that depending on the type of virus and the course of infection , production of type i ifn can also lead to immunopathology or immunosuppression .
d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	similarly , in bacterial infections type i ifn production is often associated with detrimental effects for the host .

d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	findings from mouse reporter strains and depletion experiments in in vivo infection models have brought new insights and established that the role of pdcs in type
d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	i ifn production in vivo is less important than assumed .
d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	production of type i ifn , especially the early synthesized ifnβ , is rather realized by a variety of cell types and can not be mainly attributed to pdcs .
d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	indeed , the cell populations responsible for type i ifn production vary with the type of pathogen , its tissue tropism , and the route of infection .
d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	in this review , we summarize recent findings from in vivo models on the cellular source of type i ifn in different infectious settings , ranging from virus , bacteria , and fungi to eukaryotic parasites .

501c5d126afc8f370cde39c613a23366f99983c7	although the gmca mutant was able to induce the formation of nodules , the symbiotic ability was severely impaired , which led to an abnormal nodulation phenotype coupled to a 30 % reduction in the nitrogen fixation capacity .
501c5d126afc8f370cde39c613a23366f99983c7	the observation on ultrastructure of 4-week pea nodules showed that the mutant bacteroids tended to start senescence earlier and accumulate poly - β - hydroxybutyrate ( phb ) granules .

52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	the objectives were to collect baseline data on the occurrence , testing and vaccination practices , and clinical outcomes of feline leukaemia virus ( felv ) and feline immunodeficiency virus ( fiv ) in new zealand methods a cross - sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in new zealand was performed to collect data on felv and fiv testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point - of - care elisa at a first - opinion veterinary practice between 7 april 2010 and 23 june 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	survival times were estimated using kaplan - meier methods .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	results
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	the survey was completed by 112 clinics ( 26.4 % ) of which 72 performed in - house testing .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	of the 2125 tests performed , 56 ( 2.6 % ) were positive for
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	felv and 393 ( 18.5 % ) were positive for fiv .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	fewer than 1 % of cats were vaccinated for felv , with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both felv and fiv test positivity .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	the median survival times of felv and fiv test - positive cats were 10 days ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 0 - 16 ) and 650 days ( 95 % ci 431 - 993 ) , respectively .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	conclusions and relevance testing and vaccination for felv and fiv in new zealand appears targeted towards high - risk animals , which may bias prevalence estimates .
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	baseline data should be monitored for changes in felv epidemiology now commercial vaccines are no longer available .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	background and objective early management of traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) is essential .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin d over early clinical outcome and serum cytokine levels in patients with moderate to severe brain injury .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	methods thirty - five patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the icu unit were recruited into the study .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	subjects were randomly allocated to a treatment regimen comprising either a one - time oral dose of 120,000 iu ( two tablets of 60,000 iu each ) of vitamin d ( n = 20 ) or 8 mg of saccharide ( two tablets of 4 g each ) as placebo ( n = 15 ) .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	the main parameters evaluated included duration of mechanical ventilation and icu stay , glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) and cytokine levels ( interleukin ( il)-6 , tumour necrosis factor ( tnf)-α , interferon ( ifn)-γ , il-2 ) .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	the results indicated an improvement in the level of consciousness after 7 days in the vitamin d - treated group compared with placebo .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	an elevation in gcs score by 3.86 units in the vitamin d - treated group with a 0.19-unit descent in the control group was recorded .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	duration of mechanical ventilation was reduced in the vitamin d - treated group compared with the control group ( 4.7 days vs. 8.2 days , p value 0.0001 ) .
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	a noticeable reduction was recorded in inflammatory biomarkers ( cytokines ) in the vitamin d - treated group ( il-6 p = 0.08 , tnf - α p = 0.02 , il-2 p = 0.36 ) with notable elevation in ifn - γ ( p = 0.65 ) compared to the control group .

fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	this study was carried out in the district of lapseki in çanakkale , turkey .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	the suitability of land in lapseki for agriculture was evaluated by using an analytic hierarchy process .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	in the study , the basic parameters were determined by using the soil map and the shuttle radar topography mission data .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	land use capability classes , soil depth , erosion risk and other soil properties ( limiting factors ) were obtained from the soil map , while slope , elevation and aspect were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission data .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	to determine the weight of the parameters in the analytic hierarchy process , the opinions of the public institutions and experts were obtained .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	the obtained data were analyzed with the analytic hierarchy process and mapped with geographic information systems techniques , and a land suitability map was generated .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	the agricultural land suitability map demonstrated that 2.95 % ( 2557 ha ) of the lands in the study area were highly suitable ; 10.37 % ( 8989 ha ) were moderately suitable ; 53.47 % ( 46,336 ha ) were marginally suitable ; and 33.21 % ( 28,775 ha ) were not suitable for agricultural use .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	the data from the agricultural land suitability map were compared with the coordination of information on the environment 2012 data .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	as a result of comparison , 14.12 % ( 361 ha ) of highly suitable lands for agriculture and 2.25 % ( 202 ha ) of moderate suitable lands for agriculture are urbanized .
fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	it was seen that 45.71 % ( 24,837 ha ) of the lands that are marginally suitable for agriculture and 18.76 % ( 5397 ha ) of the not suitable lands had current land use for agriculture .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	common cold viruses create significant health and financial burdens , and understanding key loci of transmission would help focus control strategies .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	this study ( 1 ) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test ( acquisition ) or a positive to negative test ( loss ) of rhinovirus ( hrv ) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year , ( 2 ) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission , and ( 3 ) builds data - based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	we detected hrv , coronavirus , paramyxovirus , influenza and bocavirus with the filmarray polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) platform ( biofire diagnostics , llc ) .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	we used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of hrv including demographic characteristics of individuals , their household , their current infection status , and prevalence within their household and across the population .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	we apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	acquisition of hrv was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus , and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	loss of hrv is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	within households , only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission , while between households only a higher number of infected older children ( ages 5 - 19 ) increases the probability of acquisition .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	coronaviruses , paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission .
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	simulations show that age - dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean hrv prevalence .

025931fab21cf63c99d33a3fc8e2818c1b6c86be	in this chapter , we describe a validated and optimized indirect elisa protocol based on recombinant s1 subunit ( amino acids 1 - 725 ) of mers - cov for qualitative and quantitative determination of mers - covbinding antibodies .
e8041691889938fa8e374b16167f56a0a01443b4	the covid-19 pandemic has caused a global shortage of personal protective equipment .
e8041691889938fa8e374b16167f56a0a01443b4	while existing supply chains are struggling to meet the surge in demand , the limited supply of n95 filtering facepiece respirators ( ffrs ) has placed healthcare workers at risk .
e8041691889938fa8e374b16167f56a0a01443b4	this paper presents a method for scalable and distributed manufacturing of ffr filter material based on a combination of centrifugal melt spinning utilizing readily available cotton candy machines as an example .
e8041691889938fa8e374b16167f56a0a01443b4	the proposed method produces nonwoven polypropylene fabric material with filtering efficiency of up to 96 % for particles 0.30 - 0.49 µm in diameter .
e8041691889938fa8e374b16167f56a0a01443b4	we additionally demonstrate a scalable means to test for filtration efficiency and pressure drop to ensure a standardized degree of quality in the output material .
e8041691889938fa8e374b16167f56a0a01443b4	we perform preliminary optimization of relevant parameters for scale - up and propose that this is a viable method to rapidly produce up to one million n95 ffrs per day in distributed manner with just six machines per site operating across 200 locations .
e8041691889938fa8e374b16167f56a0a01443b4	we share this work as a starting point for others to rapidly construct , replicate and develop their own affordable modular processes aimed at producing high quality filtration material to address the current ffr shortage globally .

185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	the essential requirement of the lymphotoxin beta receptor ( ltβr ) in the development and maintenance of peripheral lymphoid organs is well recognized .
185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	evidence shows that ltβr is involved in various cellular processes ; however , whether it plays a role in maintaining the cellular function of intestinal porcine enterocytes ( ipec - j2 ) , specifically during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) infection , remains unknown .
185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	in this study , we generated ltβr null ipec - j2 cells using crispr / cas9 to examine the importance of ltβr in cell proliferation , apoptosis , and the response to pedv infection .
185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	our results showed that the lack of ltβr leads to significantly decreased cell proliferation , potentially due to s phase arrest in ltβr −/− ipec - j2 cells .
185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	label - free digital holographic microscopy was used to record the three - dimensional morphology of both cell types for up to 72 hours and revealed significantly increased numbers of ltβr −/− cells undergoing apoptosis .
185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	furthermore , we found that pedv - infected ltβr −/−
185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	null ipec - j2 cells exhibited significant suppression of nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells ( nfκb ) target genes ( interleukin ( il)-6 and il-8 ) and mucosal barrier integrity - related genes ( vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( vcam1 ) and il-22 ) , which may explain why ltβr −/− cells are more susceptible to pedv infection .
185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	collectively , our data not only demonstrate the key role of ltβr in intestinal porcine enterocytes , but also provide data for the improved understanding of the cellular response to pedv infection .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	background : gastric cancer ( gc ) is a malignancy with high morbidity / mortality , partly due to a lack of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	it is important to develop reliable biomarker(s ) with specificity , sensitivity and convenience for early diagnosis .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	the role of tumour - associated macrophages ( tams ) and survival of gc patients are controversial .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	macrophage colony stimulating factor ( mcsf ) regulates monocytes / macrophages .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	elevated mcsf is correlated with invasion , metastasis and poor survival of tumour patients .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	il-34 , a ligand of the m - csf receptor , acts as a " twin " to m - csf , demonstrating overlapping and complimentary actions .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	il-34 involvement in tumours is controversial , possibly due to the levels of m - csf receptors .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	while the il-34 / m - csf / m - csfr axis is very important for regulating macrophage differentiation , the specific interplay between these cytokines , macrophages and tumour development is unclear .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	a multi - factorial evaluation could provide more objective utility , particularly for either prediction and/ or prognosis of gastric cancer .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	precision medicine requires molecular diagnosis to determine the specifically mutant function of tumours , and is becoming popular in the treatment of malignancy .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	therefore , elucidating specific molecular signalling pathways in specific cancers facilitates the success of a precision medicine approach .

8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	using immunohistochemistry / histopathology , m - csf , il-34 and macrophages were determined .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	we found that il-34 may serve as a predictive biomarker , but not as an independent , prognostic factor in gc ; m - csf inversely correlated with survival of gc in tnm iii - iv subtypes .
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	increased cd68 + tams were a good prognostic factor in some cases and could be used as an independent prognostic factor in male t3 stage gc .

7c7e058a7a630f3529a064cd3cce2fc70f246ff1	of the 2482 articles retrieved on covid-19 , 1165 were included .
7c7e058a7a630f3529a064cd3cce2fc70f246ff1	over half of them were secondary articles ( 590 , 50.6 % ) .
7c7e058a7a630f3529a064cd3cce2fc70f246ff1	common primary articles were : human medical research ( 340 , 59.1 % ) , in silico studies ( 182 , 31.7 % ) and in vitro studies ( 26 , 4.5 % ) .
7c7e058a7a630f3529a064cd3cce2fc70f246ff1	of the human medical research , the vast majority were observational studies and cases series , followed by single case reports and one randomized controlled trial .
7c7e058a7a630f3529a064cd3cce2fc70f246ff1	secondary articles were mainly reviews , viewpoints and editorials ( 373 , 63.2 % ) .
7c7e058a7a630f3529a064cd3cce2fc70f246ff1	limitations were reported in 42 out of 1165 abstracts ( 3.6 % ) , with 10 abstracts reporting actual methodological limitations .

bc67c021d6e189215a0101f6e5de32daa8e4ccee	bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of coronaviruses ( covs ) , including those closely related to human pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) cov and middle east respiratory syndrome
bc67c021d6e189215a0101f6e5de32daa8e4ccee	cov.
bc67c021d6e189215a0101f6e5de32daa8e4ccee	there are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in thailand , of which two are endemic species .
bc67c021d6e189215a0101f6e5de32daa8e4ccee	due to the zoonotic potential of covs , standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative .
bc67c021d6e189215a0101f6e5de32daa8e4ccee	findings :
bc67c021d6e189215a0101f6e5de32daa8e4ccee	a total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in eastern thailand between 2008 and 2013 ( 84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs ) .

3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	despite ongoing conceptual , theoretical , and empirical debates , a large number of retrospective self - report scales have been produced to ostensibly measure various classes of such behaviour .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	these scales are typically based on a variety of theoretical and diagnostic frameworks .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	given current conceptual ambiguities , building on previous studies , we evaluated the dimensional structure of 50 scales targeting the assessment of supposedly problematic behaviours in relation to four technologies : internet , smartphones , video games , and social network sites .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	we find that two dimensions ( ' compulsive use ' and ' negative outcomes ' ) account for over 50 % of all scale - items analysed .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	with a median of five dimensions , on average , scales have considered fewer dimensions than various proposed diagnostic criteria and models .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	no relationships were found between the number of items in a scale and the number of dimensions , or the technology category and the dimensional structure .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	the findings indicate , firstly , that a majority of scales place an inordinate emphasis on some dimensions over others and , secondly , that despite differences in the items presented , at a dimensional level , there exists a high degree of similarity between scales .
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	these findings highlight shortcomings in existing scales and underscore the need to develop more sophisticated conceptions and empirical tools to understand possible problematic interactions with various digital technologies .

4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	results :
4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	mhl research has developed rapidly in china in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades .
4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	there were 350 peer - reviewed publications included in this review , covering diverse settings and participants .
4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	of these publications , 313 ( 89.4 % ) were published in chinese - language journals and 37 in english - language journals ; 303 ( 86.6 % ) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of mhl interventions .
4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	mhl research in china has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health - related knowledge and beliefs .

4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	the majority of mhl tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in china ( n = 97 , 80.2 % ) and almost half of these studies ( 57.8 % ) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics .
4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	conclusions :
4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	more interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve mhl and promote behaviour change , are needed in china .
4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	these should be evaluated with high - quality study designs , such as randomised controlled trials .

01e22956c79df3220a67bce71cf22de95d29b723	derived monoclonal antibodies ( hmabs ) from 2 individuals exposed to primary denv infections .
01e22956c79df3220a67bce71cf22de95d29b723	most denv - specific hmabs were serotype cross - reactive and weakly neutralizing .
01e22956c79df3220a67bce71cf22de95d29b723	moreover , many hmabs bound to the viral pre - membrane protein and other sites on the virus that were not preserved when the viral envelope protein was produced as a soluble , recombinant antigen ( re protein ) .
01e22956c79df3220a67bce71cf22de95d29b723	nonetheless , by modifying the screening procedure to detect rare antibodies that bound to re , we were able to isolate and map human antibodies that strongly neutralized the homologous serotype of denv .
01e22956c79df3220a67bce71cf22de95d29b723	our mabs results indicate that , in these two individuals exposed to primary denv infections , a small fraction of the total antibody response was responsible for virus neutralization .

f0f0ef13afba2979ade2879b534fe05b8eb048c0	the recent outbreak of sars - cov-2 has prompted healthcare professionals to re - design and modify the standards of care and operating procedures relevant to dealing with suspected or confirmed cases of covid-19 .
f0f0ef13afba2979ade2879b534fe05b8eb048c0	the aim of this review is to highlight the key recommendations related to obstetric anaesthesia from scientific bodies in the united kingdom and united states and to summarize recently developed and implemented clinical pathways for care of obstetric patients -specifically those requiring urgent general anaesthesia for caesarean section within a large maternity unit in london .
f0f0ef13afba2979ade2879b534fe05b8eb048c0	the need to perform an emergency operative delivery in a timely manner while ensuring clinicians are suitably equipped and protected represents a uniquely challenging scenario , given the higher risk of viral transmission with aerosol generating procedures .
f0f0ef13afba2979ade2879b534fe05b8eb048c0	in these settings , emphasis needs to be put on meticulous preparation , safety checklists and specific equipment and staffing adjustments .
f0f0ef13afba2979ade2879b534fe05b8eb048c0	we present a structured framework comprised of four critical steps aimed to facilitate the development of local strategies and protocols .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	background :
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	griffithsin is a broad spectrum antiviral lectin that inhibits viral entry and maturation processes through binding clusters of oligomannose glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	an efficient , scaleable manufacturing process for griffithsin active pharmaceutical ingredient ( api ) is essential for particularly cost - sensitive products such as griffithsin
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	-based
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	topical microbicides for hiv-1 prevention in resource poor settings .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	our previously published purification method used ceramic filtration followed by two chromatography steps , resulting in a protein recovery of 30 % .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	our objective was to develop a scalable purification method for griffithsin expressed in nicotiana benthamiana plants that would increase yield , reduce production costs , and simplify manufacturing techniques .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	considering the future need to transfer griffithsin manufacturing technology to resource poor areas , we chose to focus modifying the purification process , paying particular attention to introducing simple , low - cost , and scalable procedures such as use of temperature , ph , ion concentration , and filtration to enhance product recovery .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	results :
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	we achieved > 99 % pure griffithsin api by generating the initial green juice extract in ph 4 buffer , heating the extract to 55 ° c , incubating overnight with a bentonite mgcl 2 mixture , and final purification with capto ™ multimodal chromatography .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	griffithsin extracted with this protocol maintains activity comparable to griffithsin purified by the previously published method
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	and we are able to recover a substantially higher yield : 88 ± 5 % of griffithsin from the initial extract .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	the method was scaled to produce gram quantities of griffithsin with high yields , low endotoxin levels , and low purification costs maintained .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	conclusions :
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	the methodology developed to purify griffithsin introduces and develops multiple tools for purification of recombinant proteins from plants at an industrial scale .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	these tools allow for robust cost - effective production and purification of griffithsin .
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	the methodology can be readily scaled to the bench top or industry and process components can be used for purification of additional proteins based on biophysical characteristics .

76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	its apparent endemicity and the wide spread of its reservoir host ( dromedary camels ) in the arabian peninsula highlight the ongoing public health threat of this virus .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	therefore , development of effective prophylactic vaccine needs to be urgently explored given that there are no approved prophylactics or therapeutics for humans or animals to date .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	different vaccine candidates have been investigated but serious safety concerns remain over protein or full - length spike ( s ) protein - based vaccines .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	here , we investigated the immunogenicity of naked dna vaccines expressing different fragments of mers - cov s protein in mice .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	we found that plasmids expressing full - length ( ps ) or s1-subunit ( ps1 ) could induce significant levels of s1-specific antibodies ( abs ) but with distinct igg isotype patterns .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	specifically , ps1 immunization elicited a balanced th1 / th2 response and generally higher levels of all igg isotypes compared to ps vaccination .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	interestingly , only mice immunized with ps1 demonstrated significant s1specific cellular immune response .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	importantly , both constructs induced cross - neutralizing abs against multiple strains of human and camel origins .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	these results indicate that vaccines expressing s1-subunit of the mers - cov s protein could represent a potential vaccine candidate without the possible safety concerns associated with full - length protein - based vaccines .

76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	saudi arabia has reported the largest number of cases so far with cases continuing to increase .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	the virus causes severe respiratory infection associated with fever , cough , acute pneumonia , shortness of breath , systemic infection and occasional multi - organ failure in infected individuals leading to death in 35 - 40 % of the cases 2 - 4 .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	such a severe disease usually occurs in immunocompromised patients , individuals with comorbidities and the elderly 1,4 - 6 .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	most of the reported mers cases are linked to hospital outbreaks and family clusters due to close contact with infected patients 4,7 - 10 .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	however , accumulating epidemiological data show high prevalence of mers - cov in dromedary camels from several arabian and african countries , suggesting that dromedaries might be the reservoir hosts of this virus 4,11 - 15 .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	the continued endemicity of mers - cov in the arabian peninsula and the associated high death rate clearly represent a public health concern with potential global spread as observed in the recent outbreak in south korea 10 .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	this is further complicated by the lack of prophylactic or therapeutic measures , underscoring the importance of preparedness research against this potential pandemic virus .
76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	several supportive therapies and antivirals were proposed and examined for the treatment of mers - cov infections [ 16 ]

76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	however , most of these strategies were based on the experience gained during the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) outbreak or from mers - cov in vitro studies and require further preclinical and
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	the florida manatee ( trichechus manatus latirotris ) is a threatened aquatic mammal in united states coastal waters .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	over the past decade , the appearance of papillomavirusinduced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	to date , three manatee papillomaviruses ( tmpvs ) have been identified in florida manatees , one forming cutaneous lesions ( tmpv1 ) and two forming genital lesions ( tmpv3 and tmpv4 ) .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	we identified dna sequences with the potential to form g - quadruplex structures ( g4 ) across the three genomes .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	g4 were located on both dna strands and across coding and non - coding regions on all tmpvs , offering multiple targets for viral control .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	although g4 have been identified in several viral genomes , including human pvs , most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three gtetrads .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	in contrast , the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non - canonical structures with only two g - tetrads .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of g4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the e2 region .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two g - tetrad structures , perhaps serving to increase structural stability .

c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	several g4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all pvs , most notably on the reverse strand in the e2 region .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	in other cases , g4 were identified at similar regional locations only on pvs forming genital lesions .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	on all tmpvs , g4 sequences were located in the non - coding region near putative e2 binding sites .

c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	in rna , g4 identified in 3 ' and 5 ' untranslated regions are known to regulate protein synthesis [ 9 , 10 ] .
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	g4 function as regulators through at least a couple of different mechanisms [ 1 ] .

dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	abstract :
dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	prompt identification of cases is critical for slowing the spread of covid-19 .
dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	however , many areas have faced diagnostic testing shortages , requiring difficult decisions to be made regarding who receives a test , without knowing the implications of those decisions on population - level transmission dynamics .
dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	clinical prediction rules ( cprs ) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions .
dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	we used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable cpr to identify those who are most likely to test positive , and found that its application to prioritize testing increases the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity .
dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	to consider the implications of these gains in daily case detection on the population level , we incorporated testing using the cpr into a compartmentalized disease transmission model .
dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	we found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak ( i.e. " flattens the curve " ) , with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number ( such as with concurrent social distancing measures ) , and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing .
dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	additionally , prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit ( icu ) burden .
dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	in conclusion , we present a novel approach to evidence - based allocation of limited diagnostic capacity , to achieve public health goals for covid-19 .

7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	mechanisms between hap and pneumonia are poorly understood , but studies suggest that hap may increase the likelihood of bacterial , instead of viral , pneumonia .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	we assessed the relationship between hap and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the ghana randomized air pollution and health study ( graphs ) .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	methods :
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	data are from graphs , a cluster - randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions ( improved biomass or lpg ) versus the 3-stone ( baseline ) cookstove .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	( n = 130 ) and healthy controls ( n = 130 ) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by masstag polymerase chain reaction .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	data analyses included intention - to - treat ( itt ) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm , and exposure - response relationships .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	results :
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	in itt analyses , 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the lpg ( lpg : 2.71 , 3-stone : 3.34 , p < 0.0001 , n = 260 ) .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	this difference was driven by increased bacterial ( p < 0.0001 ) rather than viral species presence ( non - significant ) .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	higher prevalence bacterial species were haemophilus influenzae , streptococcus pneumoniae , and moraxella catarrhalis .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	exposure - response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured co and nasal microbial carriage .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	our intention - to - treat findings are consistent with a link between hap and bacterial nasal carriage .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	no relationships were found for viral carriage .
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	given the null results in exposure - response analysis , it is likely that a pollutant besides co is driving these differences .

1002ecf8d075ecbffe0e379e7a8fb98f9789c8e7	virtual screening studies on the therapeutically relevant proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) require a detailed characterization of their druggable binding sites , and , more generally , a convenient pocket mapping represents a key step for structure - based in silico studies
1002ecf8d075ecbffe0e379e7a8fb98f9789c8e7	; ( 2 ) methods :
1002ecf8d075ecbffe0e379e7a8fb98f9789c8e7	along with a careful literature search on sars - cov-2 protein targets , the study presents a novel strategy for pocket mapping based on the combination of pocket ( as performed by the well - known fpocket tool ) and docking searches ( as performed by plants or autodock / vina engines ) ; such an approach is implemented by the pockets 2.0 plug - in for the vega zz suite of programs ; ( 3 ) results
1002ecf8d075ecbffe0e379e7a8fb98f9789c8e7	: the literature analysis allowed the identification of 16 promising binding cavities within the sars - cov-2 proteins and the here proposed approach was able to recognize them showing performances clearly better than those reached by the sole pocket detection ; and ( 4 ) conclusions : even though the presented strategy should require more extended validations , this proved successful in precisely characterizing a set of sars - cov-2 druggable binding pockets including both orthosteric and allosteric sites , which are clearly amenable for virtual screening campaigns and drug repurposing studies .
1002ecf8d075ecbffe0e379e7a8fb98f9789c8e7	all results generated by the study and the pockets 2.0 plug - in are available for download .
ee1c20d3d0762e07830b93f37313b5549c08dc25	in 2015 , an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus occurred in saudi arabia and necessitated special measures to be implemented to control the spread of the virus .
ee1c20d3d0762e07830b93f37313b5549c08dc25	in this article , we will discuss how the outbreak was managed in the vascular and interventional radiology ( vir ) suite in a large tertiary care hospital in saudi arabia .
ee1c20d3d0762e07830b93f37313b5549c08dc25	various measures were taken to reduce the risk of transmission of infection .
ee1c20d3d0762e07830b93f37313b5549c08dc25	unit - level education played an important role in the care of patients .
ee1c20d3d0762e07830b93f37313b5549c08dc25	a hospital - wide educational program was implemented to ensure zero transmission of infection .
ee1c20d3d0762e07830b93f37313b5549c08dc25	special attention was made to monitor staff who acquired the virus .
ee1c20d3d0762e07830b93f37313b5549c08dc25	vir suite was able to handle the situation and control the outbreak .
3959ab255fd5f8ba79cd04285ac445d848a77659	coronaviruses ( covs ) infect humans and many animal species , and are associated with respiratory , enteric , hepatic , and central nervous system diseases .
3959ab255fd5f8ba79cd04285ac445d848a77659	the large size of the cov genome and the instability of some cov replicase gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria , represent serious obstacles for the development of reverse genetic systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense rna viruses .
3959ab255fd5f8ba79cd04285ac445d848a77659	to overcome these limitations , several alternatives to more conventional plasmid - based approaches have been established in the last thirteen years .
3959ab255fd5f8ba79cd04285ac445d848a77659	in this report , we briefly review and discuss the different reverse genetic systems developed for covs , paying special attention to the severe acute respiratory syndrome cov ( sars - cov ) .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	human papillomaviruses ( hpvs ) are formally described by isolation of their circular double - stranded dna genomes and establishment and comparison of the nucleotide sequence of these genomes .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of hpvs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	novel hpv isolates have traditionally been described as " types " .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	the analysis of specific hpv types is of medical importance , because hpv types typically induce type - specific lesions , i.e. they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia , or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	recently , it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	within the papillomavirus family , closely or remotely related types form species or genera .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	these formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses , bacteria and higher organisms , although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	notably , however , hpv types that are closely related ( i.e. form " species " ) are associated with similar lesions .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	confusion of the terms " type " and " subtype " should be avoided , as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	in contrast to many rna viruses , hpv types evolve very slowly , and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2 % .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	these divergent isolates are called " variants " .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	hpvs evolved together with humankind and
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	homo sapiens was never without hpvs , and consequently never without warts and cervical cancer .
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	variants of the same hpv type may have different pathogenicity and may account for part of the worldwide disparities in the occurrence of genital cancers .

cd2179ed0f059edb5784b32e83997f362739236b	the duration , coronavirus takes to spread from one country to another country , could be seen in this dataset and could predicted the same for future pandemics through this dataset .
cd2179ed0f059edb5784b32e83997f362739236b	it is highly dependent on the cabalistic number of variables that is the main navel of these datasets .
cd2179ed0f059edb5784b32e83997f362739236b	information for this dataset is collected from trusted websites , local and international popular newspapers .
cd2179ed0f059edb5784b32e83997f362739236b	this coronavirus dataset not only help to track the spreading route of coronavirus but also can be used for predicting the possible spreading route of similar future pandemics .
cd2179ed0f059edb5784b32e83997f362739236b	this dataset consists of 186 countries ' useful data related to covid-19 pandemic from november 17 , 2019 , to may 16 , 2020 , with 8 unique variables that provide the information of the nature of the spread of covid-19 .
cd2179ed0f059edb5784b32e83997f362739236b	the datasets mainly focus on two major fields , first one is first case which consists of information of date of first case(s ) , number of confirm case(s ) at first day , age of the patient(s ) of first case , last visited country and the other one first death information consist of date of first death and age of the patient who died first for every country mentioning corresponding continent .
cd2179ed0f059edb5784b32e83997f362739236b	this dataset also can perform a bunch of predictions using machine learning applications , like -how fast the virus is spreading , affect rate , death rate , death rate and able to represent comparison between other pandemics .
cd2179ed0f059edb5784b32e83997f362739236b	using this dataset , any similar pandemic spreadness could be predicted earlier and necessary precaution measures could be taken .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	rotavirus nsp2 is an abundant non - structural rna - binding protein essential for forming the viral factories that support replication of the double - stranded rna genome .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	nsp2 exists as stable doughnut - shaped octamers within the infected cell , representing the tail - to - tail interaction of two tetramers .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	extending diagonally across the surface of each octamer are four highly basic grooves that function as binding sites for single - stranded rna .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	between the n and c - terminal domains of each monomer is a deep electropositive cleft containing a catalytic site that hydrolyzes the γ - β phosphoanhydride bond of any ntp .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	the catalytic site has similarity to those of the histidine triad
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	( hit ) family of nucleotide - binding proteins .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts , we investigated the possibility that the rna - binding activity of the groove promoted the insertion of the 5′-triphosphate moiety of the rna into the cleft , and the subsequent hydrolysis of its γ - β phosphoanhydride bond .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	our results show that nsp2 hydrolyzes the γp from rnas and ntps through mg 2+dependent activities that proceed with similar reaction velocities , that require the catalytic his225 residue , and that produce a phosphorylated intermediate .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	competition assays indicate that although both substrates enter the active site , rna is the preferred substrate due to its higher affinity for the octamer .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	the rna triphosphatase
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	( rtpase ) activity of nsp2 may account for the absence of the 5′-terminal γp on the ( − ) strands of the double - stranded rna genome segments .
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	this is the first report of a hit - like protein with a multifunctional catalytic site , capable of accommodating both ntps and rnas during γp hydrolysis .

054146e07ab249958e8d3fb478cda2123d6c9219	data acquired by a synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) , onboard a satellite or an airborne platform , must be processed to produce a visible image .
054146e07ab249958e8d3fb478cda2123d6c9219	for this reason , data must be transferred to the ground station and processed through a time / computing - consuming focusing algorithm .
054146e07ab249958e8d3fb478cda2123d6c9219	thanks to the advances in avionic technology , now gpus are available for onboard processing , and an opportunity for sar focusing opened .
054146e07ab249958e8d3fb478cda2123d6c9219	due to the unavailability of avionic platforms for this research , we developed a gpu - parallel algorithm on commercial off - theshelf graphics cards , and with the help of a proper scaling factor , we projected execution times for the case of an avionic gpu .
054146e07ab249958e8d3fb478cda2123d6c9219	we evaluated performance using envisat ( environmental satellite ) asar image mode level 0 on both nvidia kepler and turing architectures .
f720a25037eb5929356b35a90306a3b88642f04e	we formulate three basic assumptions that should ideally guide any welldesigned covid-19 prevalence study .
f720a25037eb5929356b35a90306a3b88642f04e	we provide , on the basis of these assumptions alone , a full derivation of mathematical formulas required for statistical analysis of testing data .
f720a25037eb5929356b35a90306a3b88642f04e	in particular , we express the disease prevalence in a population through those for its homogeneous subpopulations .
f720a25037eb5929356b35a90306a3b88642f04e	although some of these formulas are routinely employed in prevalence studies , the study design often contravenes the assumptions upon which these formulas vitally depend .
f720a25037eb5929356b35a90306a3b88642f04e	we also designed a natural prevalence estimator from the testing data and studied some of its properties .
f720a25037eb5929356b35a90306a3b88642f04e	the results are equally valid for diseases other than covid-19 as well as in non - epidemiological settings .
1000bb530ad4470adf1759d6db0bdf35bcddfe60	on march 13th , 2020 , the world health organization effectively established that europe is the new the covid-19 pandemic world epicenter , as cases in italy and other european nations soared .
1000bb530ad4470adf1759d6db0bdf35bcddfe60	the numbers in italy have climbed with over 80,000 cases as of march 25th , 2020 and with over 8000 deaths , placing italy now as the country with the highest mortality rate .
1000bb530ad4470adf1759d6db0bdf35bcddfe60	importantly , older adults are particularly vulnerable to get severe illness , complications , and to have a higher mortality rate than any other age group .

639d72e58322c4b81bb89ad026ac84908fbcab7e	it is not widely known that quite a few researchers are faced with difficulties in using various resources of disaster management research in korea .
639d72e58322c4b81bb89ad026ac84908fbcab7e	the article aims to assess how rigorously the korean field of disaster management research resources has been managed or how it can be improved for the ultimate goal of disaster management .

639d72e58322c4b81bb89ad026ac84908fbcab7e	in doing so , electronic research resources have been systematically compared with integrated research resources via the perspective of korean - speaking researchers and that of english - speaking researchers .
639d72e58322c4b81bb89ad026ac84908fbcab7e	the conclusion is that two researchers have to be integrated with all four research resources ( open , blind , hidden , and unknown resources ) by implementing assigned responsibilities as well as freely asking questions .

7da72db559c616a430aa3e2d779528f0239e3993	eleven laboratory parameters showed significant differences between male and female patients , and six of them were higher during the whole clinical course in patients who died than in patients who were discharged .
7da72db559c616a430aa3e2d779528f0239e3993	in adjusted logistic regression analysis , males with comorbidities presented a higher risk of being critically ill than males without comorbidities ( or = 3.824 , 95 % ci = 1.279 - 11.435 ) .

713ebd54a9147bcf49995bab8fe959a8735ec2ed	in the majority of living organisms the genetic information is stored in the desoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) , molecules that govern the development and functions of the organisms .
713ebd54a9147bcf49995bab8fe959a8735ec2ed	the high accuracy of duplication and transmission of the dna is determined by its structural features and the unique fidelity of the proteins participating in this process .

ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	the detection of nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors is an ancient and 27 conserved component of the innate immune system .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	notably , rna virus genomes 28 are sensed by mammalian cytosolic rig - i - like receptors , thereby activating 29 interferon - stimulated gene ( isg ) expression to restrict viral replication .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	however , 30 recent evidence indicates that the cgas - sting dna sensing pathway also 31 protects against rna viruses .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	so far , the mechanisms responsible for dna sensing 32 of rna viruses , which replicate without known dna intermediates , remain unclear .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	33
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	by using cgas gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell 34 , we discovered that dna sensing and cgamp
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	synthase activities are 35 required for cgas - mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and sindbis 36 virus .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	the level of cgamp produced in response to rna virus infection was below 37 the threshold of detection , suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of 38 cgamp are produced during rna virus infections .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	to clarify the dna ligands that 39 activate cgas activity , we confirmed that cgas binds mitochondrial dna in the 40 cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells ; however , the amount of 41 cgas - associated mitochondrial dna did not change in response to virus infection .

ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	rather , a variety of pre - existing cytosolic dnas , including mitochondrial dna and 43 endogenous cdnas , may serve as stimuli for basal cgas activation .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	importantly , 44 cgas knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cgas drives 45 low - level isg expression at steady state .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	we propose that cgas - sting restricts 46 rna viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells , likely 47 primed by endogenous cellular dna ligands .

ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	many medically important rna viruses are restricted by the cgas - sting 50 dna - sensing pathway of innate immune activation .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	since these viruses replicate 51 without dna intermediates , it is unclear
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	what dna ligand(s ) are responsible for 52 triggering this pathway .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	we show here that cgas 's dna binding and signaling 53 activities are required for rna virus restriction , similar to the mechanisms by which it 54 restricts dna viruses .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	furthermore , we confirmed that cgas continuously binds host 55 dna , which was unaffected by rna virus infection .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	finally , cgas expression 56 correlated with the low - level expression of interferon - stimulated genes in uninfected 57 cells , both in vitro and in vivo .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	we propose that cgas - mediated sensing of 58 endogenous dna ligands contributes to rna virus restriction by establishing a 59 baseline of innate immune activation .

ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	71
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	the stimulator of interferon genes ( sting ) is an endoplasmic reticulum - and 72 mitochondrial - bound protein that spontaneously activates isg expression when 73 overexpressed ( 2 ) .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	although sting is involved in dna sensing , sting -/mice and 74 mouse endothelial fibroblasts ( mefs ) are more permissive for vesicular stomatitis 75 virus ( vsv ) , a negative - stand rna virus ( 2 , 3 ) .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	additionally , studies in mefs 76 deficient in three prime repair exonuclease 1 ( trex1 ) , a nuclease important for the 77 turnover of cytosolic retroelement cdnas ( 4 ) , have described enhanced antiviral 78 phenotypes in response to a wide array of rna viruses and retroviruses , 79 presumably due to the accumulation of dna in the cytosol ( 5 , 6 ) .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	it appears that this 80 dna - based restriction is broad , as many rna viruses have evolved mechanisms to 81 subvert the cgas - sting pathway , including flaviviruses ( 7 - 9 ) ,

ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	it is unclear whether these 164 modest decreases in infection of the cgas mutants was due to hcgas - ha3x 165 overexpression in thp-1 cells , residual hcgas activities , or normal clonal 166 variation of cells .
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	nevertheless , these results are most consistent with an integral 167 role for cgas dna binding and cgamp synthase activities in rna virus restriction .

04c5c55f5258fa7fe5f5d404e6af5a5262f273c1	we find that the novel a / h1n1 influenza viruses exhibit very low genetic divergence and suffer strong purifying selection among human population and confirm that they originated from the reassortment of previous triple - reassortant swine influenza viruses including genomic segments from both avian and human lineages with north american and eurasian swine lineages .
04c5c55f5258fa7fe5f5d404e6af5a5262f273c1	the longer phylogenetic branch length to their nearest genetic neighbors indicates that the origin of the novel a / h1n1 is unlikely to be a very recent event .
04c5c55f5258fa7fe5f5d404e6af5a5262f273c1	seventy - six new unique mutations are found to be monomorphically fixed in the novel a / h1n1 virus lineages , suggesting a role of selective sweep in the early evolution of this virus .

368716e8edd8bb0e66e5376db3c05001c53ba2d4	correcting for possible confounders , we estimated their causal effects on reported case numbers .
368716e8edd8bb0e66e5376db3c05001c53ba2d4	to this end , we used a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the aforementioned determinants on new reported cases of covid-19 .
368716e8edd8bb0e66e5376db3c05001c53ba2d4	based on this , we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors .

71ca9c47557dbaab93da02228d0b500fb20c710b	the patient was afebrile , had an oxygen saturation of 100 % , and denied chest pain as well as shortness of breath .
71ca9c47557dbaab93da02228d0b500fb20c710b	on physical exam , she exhibited decreased breath sounds bilaterally and expiratory wheezing .

6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 has caused , by may 24th 2020 , more than 5.3 million confirmed cases worldwide .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	the necessity of keeping open and accessible public commercial establishments such as supermarkets or pharmacies increases during the pandemic provided that distancing rules and crowd control are satisfied .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	herein , using agent - based models , we explore the potential spread of the novel sars - cov-2 considering the case of a small size supermarket .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	for diverse distancing rules and number of simultaneous users ( customers ) , we question flexible and limited movement policies , guiding the flow and interactions of users in place .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	results indicate that a guided , limited in movement and well - organized policy combined with a distance rule of at least 1 m between users and a small number of them ( 15 ) may aid in the mitigation of potential new contagions in more than 90 % compared to the usual policy of flexible movement with more users ( 30 ) which may reach up to 64 % of mitigation of potential new infections under the same distancing conditions .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	this study may guide novel strategies for the mitigation of the current covid-19 pandemic , at any stage , and prevention of future outbreaks of sars - cov-2 or related viruses .

6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	the world is currently impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pandemic which is caused by the severe acute 2 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) that , by may 24th 2020 , has caused more than 5.3 million confirmed cases .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	3 many authorities at the global level have adopted measures known as " physical distancing " or " social distancing " ( sd ) which 4 go from schools and workplaces closure to limiting gatherings , quarantining infected individuals and their family members 5 and self - quarantining to avoid getting infected 1 , 2 .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	besides , hygiene measures have been large recommended , these include 6 washing hands , covering up when coughing or sneezing , and avoid touching the face with unwashed hands since these may be 7 frequently touched by other potentially infected people .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	one of the first reported studies of the potential effect of sd strategies 8 on covid-19 burden was developed in singapore 3 and the interventions continued in other several european countries 4 .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	the 9 objective of the sd interventions is to decelerate the spread of infection and reduce the intensity of the epidemic to avoid 10 potential overwhelming health systems and , at the same time , gain a time - line to develop treatments and vaccines .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	however , 11 a matter of consideration is that these interventions may hold for long periods with certain relaxing phases as population
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	12 immunity gradually increases allowing the measures to loosen 1 , 5 .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	there is still limited evidence to support sd measures as 13 schemes of reducing transmission and slowing down the spread , however , accessible evidence may suggest that staggered 14 and cumulative implementation of these interventions , in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases 6 15 following close scientific and ethical basis , show the most effective outcome against covid-19 7 - 9 .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	16 one of the most important players of goods supply chains for the population , as well as key social encounter places , are 17 public commercial establishments .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	supermarkets , pharmacies , grocery stores , discount stores , and other commercial chains can 18 act as a route of spread for both , clients ( users ) and place workers 10 .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	public commercial establishments are generally enclosed 19 places usually with one entrance and one exit gates that under normal situations , sd measures and the number of users has no 20 relevance .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	inside the establishment , users freely interact with each other following pretty well - defined trajectories as those of 21 supermarket corridors .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	in this manner , users and working personnel in place can be characterized in terms of their movements 22 when following the corridors as well as their physical interactions and the physical distance between and among them , under a 23 physical metric .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	in this direction , agent - based ( ab ) modeling schemes can map all desired characteristics of users and workers , 24 the agents , and their interactions in the establishment 's corridors , identified as agents ' trajectories or paths .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	ab schemes have 25 previously been used to devise strategies on health behaviors , social epidemiology 11 , and to advise on the mitigation of previous 26 influenza outbreaks 12 as well as to explore immune responses to this virus 13 .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	under this approach , ab schemes are also to be 27 employed for testing population strategies for enclosed environments for the coronavirus pandemic 14 that may add to the forces 28 of non - pharmaceutical interventions 15 especially in high - density population places , like urban scenarios 16 .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	moreover , since 29 specific conditions and characterizations can be implemented for agents and trajectories , diverse behavioral aspects can be 30 designed and tested , for instance , the checkout area design of a supermarket to model the users flow and guidance strategies 17 .
6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	herein , we explore the potential spread of the novel sars - cov-2 in public commercial establishments using an ab 32 approach .

db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	background : patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis , parkinson 's , and alzheimer 's often present with lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts , urinary frequency , urgency , nocturia and retention ) resulting from damage to the peripheral and central nervous systems .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	these studies were designed to examine the changes in the function of the bladder that may underlie neurogenic bladder dysfunction using a mouse model of demyelination in the cns .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	methods :
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	bladders from 12 week old male c57bl/6j mice with coronavirus - induced encephalomyelitis ( cie , a chronic , progressive demyelinating disease model of human ms ) , and age - matched controls , were cut into 5 - 7 strips and suspended in physiological muscle baths for tension measurement in response to agonists and electric field stimulation ( efs ) .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	experiments were performed on intact and denuded ( with mucosa removed ) bladder strips .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	results :
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	the maximum effect of efs was not significantly different between cie and control bladders .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	nerve - evoked efs contractions ( tetrodotoxin - sensitive ) were blocked by a combination of atropine ( cholinergic antagonist ) and a , b - methylene atp ( an atp analog that desensitizes purinergic receptors ) .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	in response to efs , the a , b - methylene atp - resistant ( cholinergic ) component of contraction was significantly reduced , while the atropine - resistant ( purinergic ) component was significantly increased in cie bladders .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	removal of the mucosa in cie bladders restored the cholinergic component .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	bethanechol ( muscarinic receptor agonist ) potency was significantly increased in cie bladders .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	conclusions :
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	our data demonstrate a deficit in the nerve - evoked cholinergic component of contraction that is not due to the ability of the smooth muscle to respond to acetylcholine .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	we conclude that neurodegenerative bladder dysfunction in this model of multiple sclerosis may be due , in part , to pathologic changes in the mucosa that causes suppression of muscarinic receptor - mediated contractile response and augmentation of purinergic response of the underlying muscle .
db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	further studies utilizing cie mice should help elucidate the pathological changes in the mucosa resulting from demyelination in the cns .

068b862614556a9971ba12b044337e14875b65b7	( covid-19 ) is poorly understood .
068b862614556a9971ba12b044337e14875b65b7	most histologic studies come from post - mortem analysis , with existing data indicating that histologic features of acute respiratory distress syndrome are typically present in fatal cases .
068b862614556a9971ba12b044337e14875b65b7	however , this observation may be misleading , due to confounding factors in pre - terminal disease , including injury resulting from prolonged mechanical ventilation .
068b862614556a9971ba12b044337e14875b65b7	ante - mortem lung biopsy may provide major pathogenetic insights , potentially providing a basis for novel treatment approaches .
068b862614556a9971ba12b044337e14875b65b7	this comparative , multicenter , prospective , observational study was planned to identify antemortem histological profile and immunohistochemical features of lung tissue in patients with covid-19 in early and late phases of the disease , including markers of inflammatory cells and major pathways involved in the cytokine storm triggering .

9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	the naked mole rat (
9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	heterocephalus glaber , rüppell , 1842 ) is a unique eusocial rodent with unusually long lifes pan .
9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	therefore , the study of spontaneous and experimentally induced pathologies in these animals is one of the most impor tant tasks of gerontology .
9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	various infections , noninfectious pathologies ( including age dependent changes ) , and tumors have been described in the naked mole rat .
9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	the most frequent pathologies are traumas ( bite wounds ) , purulent and septic com plications of traumatic injuries , renal tubular calcinosis , chronic progressive nephropathy , hepatic hemosiderosis , testicular interstitial cell hyperplasia , calcinosis cutis , cardiomyopathy , and dysbiosis related infectious lesions of the digestive system .
9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	however , the summarized data on pathology ( including tumor incidence ) and on the causes of mortality are insufficient .
9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	there are only few publications about the results of experiments where pathologies were induced in the naked mole rat .
9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	all these problems could be subjects for promising future studies without which adequate studies on mechanisms providing the long lifespan of the naked mole rat
9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	are impossible , as well as the elucidation of causes of tumor resistance of this species .
b54c233ac33061fe13fc6b56ddc4b62cd956c33b	an increase in coronavirus disease infections prompted level 4 lockdown throughout new zealand from 25 march 2020 .
b54c233ac33061fe13fc6b56ddc4b62cd956c33b	we have investigated trends in coronary and electrophysiology ( ep ) procedures before and during this lockdown .
b54c233ac33061fe13fc6b56ddc4b62cd956c33b	the number of acute procedures for st elevation myocardial infarction remained stable .
b54c233ac33061fe13fc6b56ddc4b62cd956c33b	in contrast , the number of in - patient angiograms and percutaneous intervention procedures fell by 53 % compared with the previous 4 weeks in 2020 and by 56 % compared with the corresponding period in 2019 .

03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) is a highly contagious respiratory coronavirus of domestic chickens .
03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	although mortality is low , infection with ibv results in substantial losses for the egg and meat chicken industries .
03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	despite the economic importance of ibv and decades of research into the pathogenesis of infection , significant gaps in our knowledge exist .
03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	the aim of this study was to compare the early progression of air sac lesions in birds receiving a vaccine strain of the virus or a more virulent field strain .
03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	the air sacs are lined by different types of epithelia and are relatively isolated from the environment , so they represent a unique tissue in which to study virus - induced lesions .
03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	both the pathogenic and vaccine strains of the virus produced significant lesions ; however , the lesions progressed more rapidly in the birds receiving the pathogenic strain .
03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in birds infected with the pathogenic strain of virus , ibv spike protein is detected first in the ciliated cells lining the air sac .
03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	these preliminary data provide important clues regarding potential mechanisms for ibv tissue tropism and spread and show that the nature of the virus isolate influences the early progression of ibv infection .

6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	methods :
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	we studied were 180 vlbw preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of cha gangnam hospital from january of 2006 to december of 2009 .
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	the subjects were divided into 2 groups : an nec group ( greater than stage ii on the modified bell 's criteria ) and a control group ( less than stage ii on the modified bell 's critieria ) .
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	we defined red blood cell transfusion before nec diagnosis as the frequency of transfusion until nec diagnosis ( mean day at nec diagnosis , day 18 ) in the nec group and the frequency of transfusion until 18 days after birth in the control group .
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	results :
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	of the 180 subjects , 18 ( 10 % ) belonged to the nec group , and 14 ( 78 % ) of these 18 patients had a history of transfusion before nec diagnosis .
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	the nec group received 3.1±2.9 transfusions , and the control group received 1.0±1.1 transfusions before the nec diagnosis ( p=0.005 ) .
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	in a multi variate logistic regression corrected for gestational age , apgar score at 1 minute , the presence of respiratory distress syndrome , patent ductus arteriosus , premature rupture of membrane , disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and death were confounding factors .
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	the risk of nec increased 1.63 times ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.145 to 2.305 ; p=0.007 ) with transfusion before the nec diagnosis .
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	conclusion
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	: the risk for nec increased significantly with increased transfusion frequency before the nec diagnosis .

6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	the situation has drawn international attention , including from the virology community .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	we applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by chinese virologists , but we also believe that increased transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	it is now clear that the mysterious respiratory illness in wuhan is caused by a new type of coronavirus distantly related to the sars coronavirus ( sars - cov ) [ 1 , 2 ] .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	we applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by chinese virologists [ 3 ] , as this represents an important first step in curbing the spread of the new virus to other parts of the world .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	viruses emerge and re - emerge globally without consideration for borders .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	in the recent past , we have witnessed outbreaks of sars , ebola , chikungunya , and zika [ 4 ] .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	with each new outbreak , lives are lost , and the world is placed on high alert .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	lessons have been learned from the initial coverup and misidentification of the sars pathogen in 2003 [ 5 , 6 ] , and the recent slow response of the world health organization to the 2014 - 2015 ebola outbreak [ 7 ] .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	from this perspective , it is understandable that chinese scientists cautiously released the identity and genome sequence of this new virus [ 3 ] .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	however , transparency on disease reporting to the public and data sharing with international colleagues must continue .
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	with an increasing number of new cases of infection by the new coronavirus reported in china and neighboring countries , such as japan and thailand [ 8 ] , human - to - human transmission should be thoroughly investigated .
0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c	a novel coronavirus ( sars - cov-2 ) has recently emerged as a global threat .
0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c	as the epidemic progresses , many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number r 0 -the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population .
0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c	the modeling approaches and resulting estimates of r 0 vary widely , despite relying on similar data sources .
0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c	here , we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of r 0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities : the exponential growth rate r , the mean generation intervalḡ , and the generation - interval dispersion κ .
0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c	we then apply our framework to early estimates of r 0 for the sars - cov-2 outbreak .
0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c	we show that many early r 0 estimates are overly confident .
0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c	our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of r 0 , including the shape of the generation - interval distribution , in efforts to estimate r 0 at the outset of an epidemic .
a73e544236588d55fca3340b9c62e40e6bb0ea93	gastrointestinal tract involvement is a rare complication of plasma cell neoplasia .
a73e544236588d55fca3340b9c62e40e6bb0ea93	we present a case of non - secretory type primary plasma cell leukaemia ( pcl ) with multiple gastric involvement .
a73e544236588d55fca3340b9c62e40e6bb0ea93	dual surface antigen analysis of bone marrow cells revealed that atypical plasma cells coexpressed cd38 and myeloid antigen cd13 .
a73e544236588d55fca3340b9c62e40e6bb0ea93	upper gastrointestinal endoscopy disclosed multiple submucosal masses in the body of the stomach .
a73e544236588d55fca3340b9c62e40e6bb0ea93	endoscopic biopsy specimens showed marked infiltration of atypical plasma cells consistent with a diagnosis of gastric involvement by pcl .
a73e544236588d55fca3340b9c62e40e6bb0ea93	since cd13 antigen is identical to aminopeptidase n , a membrane - bound glycoprotein thought to be involved in the process of tumour invasion , cd13 expression on neoplastic plasma cells may be related to the gastric involvement in this patient .
0487d0e154f0ccede640b41cab10d76e9c2a87a3	the nasopharyngeal swab is currently the main testing method used to diagnose covid-19 .
0487d0e154f0ccede640b41cab10d76e9c2a87a3	the principle is to collect respiratory cells infected by the virus and to use the rt - pcr ( reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction ) technique to detect the rna of the virus .
0487d0e154f0ccede640b41cab10d76e9c2a87a3	the false negative rate is high , about 30 % , which can mainly be explained by an incorrect execution of the technique may increase the false negative rate and decrease the test 's sensitivity .
0487d0e154f0ccede640b41cab10d76e9c2a87a3	the aim of this note is to help healthcare providers to perform this test correctly in adults and children .
981a43b9ee49c6ebc8dbb327b38a7ee6f279d87f	general medical training programs are aimed at promoting competency in general practice skills with a holistic perspective of patient - centered medicine for the new generation of physicians .
981a43b9ee49c6ebc8dbb327b38a7ee6f279d87f	the faculty development program was implemented to promote learning and application of the six core competencies established by the accreditation council for graduate medical education .
981a43b9ee49c6ebc8dbb327b38a7ee6f279d87f	this article describes the implementation and outcome of the current faculty development program .
981a43b9ee49c6ebc8dbb327b38a7ee6f279d87f	additional assessment tools of the faculty development program are recommended to evaluate different perspectives of outcome .
981a43b9ee49c6ebc8dbb327b38a7ee6f279d87f	our experience suggests that ostes are a realistic and well - received approach for faculty development that merits further investigation .
981a43b9ee49c6ebc8dbb327b38a7ee6f279d87f	according to the clinical instructors ' response , our faculty development program effectively increased familiarity with various teaching and assessment skills needed to teach pgy 1 residents and acgme competencies , and these clinical instructors also then subsequently applied these skills .
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	objective : the recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is increasingly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and significant mortality .
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	we aim here to identify the risk factors associated with mortality of coronavirus infected persons using a supervised machine learning approach .
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	research design and methods : clinical data of 1085 cases of covid-19 from 13 th january to 28 th february , 2020 was obtained from kaggle , an online community of data scientists .
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	430 cases were selected for the final analysis .
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	random forest classification algorithm was implemented on the dataset to identify the important predictors and their effects on mortality .
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	results :
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	the area under the roc curve obtained during model validation on the test dataset was 0.97 .
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	age was the most important variable in predicting mortality followed by the time gap between symptom onset and hospitalization .
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	conclusions :
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in covid-19 patients .
e6dd11bf76e2c2bcb955c99f5b5a5bdd113ecb69	as a consequence of missing data on tests for infection and imperfect accuracy of tests , reported rates of cumulative population infection by the sars cov-2 virus are lower than actual rates of infection .
e6dd11bf76e2c2bcb955c99f5b5a5bdd113ecb69	hence , reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates .
e6dd11bf76e2c2bcb955c99f5b5a5bdd113ecb69	understanding the time path of the covid-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative .
e6dd11bf76e2c2bcb955c99f5b5a5bdd113ecb69	this paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings , using data from illinois , new york , and italy .
e6dd11bf76e2c2bcb955c99f5b5a5bdd113ecb69	we combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context .
e6dd11bf76e2c2bcb955c99f5b5a5bdd113ecb69	we find that the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported .
e6dd11bf76e2c2bcb955c99f5b5a5bdd113ecb69	we also find that the infection fatality rate in illinois , new york , and italy is substantially lower than reported .
52d28d82e2265e869f72292bd07e1c083e0bebc9	to date , there has been little articulation of specific one health clinical activities for veterinary and human health care providers regarding emerging infectious diseases , yet they could play a critical role .
52d28d82e2265e869f72292bd07e1c083e0bebc9	under current clinical paradigms , both human and animal health professionals routinely diagnose and treat zoonotic infectious diseases in their patients , but tend to work in parallel with little cross - professional communication or coordination of care .
52d28d82e2265e869f72292bd07e1c083e0bebc9	for this to evolve toward a one health model , both types of clinicians need to see how individual cases can be ' ' sentinel events ' ' indicating environmental risk for disease emergence , and develop mechanisms of rapid communication about these risks .
52d28d82e2265e869f72292bd07e1c083e0bebc9	human and animal clinicians also need to take a more proactive and preventive approach to zoonotic diseases that includes the occupational health of animal workers in farms , laboratories , veterinary clinics , and other settings , as well as the recognition of increased risk among immunocompromised individuals in contact with animals .
52d28d82e2265e869f72292bd07e1c083e0bebc9	this requires training in one health clinical competencies including the ability to diagnose and treat zoonotic diseases , implement preventive care interventions for individual patients , provide occupational health services for animal workers , recognize sentinel cases , report cases to public heath and clinical colleagues , and assess and help to intervene with environmental factors driving infectious disease risk in humans and animals .
52d28d82e2265e869f72292bd07e1c083e0bebc9	to provide an evidence base for such competency training , there is a need for development and testing of innovative protocols for one health clinical collaborations .

6ddc2b6e3c19d389fa4a1956a88ec9d2b4a8dd99	the platform consists mainly of a content management system that stores and prepares multimedia material for the presentation of exhibits ; a recommender system that monitors objectively the visitor 's behavior so that it can further adapt the content to their needs ; and a pose estimation system that identifies an exhibit and links it to the additional content that is prepared for it .
6ddc2b6e3c19d389fa4a1956a88ec9d2b4a8dd99	we present the systems and the initial results for a selected set of exhibits in herakleidon museum , a museum holding temporary exhibitions mainly about ancient greek technology .
6ddc2b6e3c19d389fa4a1956a88ec9d2b4a8dd99	the initial evaluation that we presented is encouraging for all systems .

610cdf0a90ee7272f51c5531375a7355768f865a	canonical translation of host mrnas depends on structural elements such as the 5 ′ cap structure and/or the 3 ′ poly(a ) tail of the mrnas .
610cdf0a90ee7272f51c5531375a7355768f865a	although many viral mrnas are devoid of one or both of these structures , they can still translate efficiently using non - canonical mechanisms .
610cdf0a90ee7272f51c5531375a7355768f865a	here , we review the tools utilized by positive - sense single - stranded ( + ss ) rna plant viruses to initiate non - canonical translation , focusing on cis - acting sequences present in viral mrnas .
610cdf0a90ee7272f51c5531375a7355768f865a	we highlight how these elements may interact with host translation factors and speculate on their contribution for achieving translational control .
610cdf0a90ee7272f51c5531375a7355768f865a	we also describe other translation strategies used by plant viruses to optimize the usage of the coding capacity of their very compact genomes , including leaky scanning initiation , ribosomal frameshifting and stop - codon readthrough .

cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	sd age was similar ( 44 ± 13 and 51 ± 17 years , respectively , p = 0.15 ) .
cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	h1n1 patients had lower apache iii scores ( 66 ± 20 vs. 89 ± 32 , p = 0.015 ) and had higher pplat and peep on days 1 , 3 , and 14 .
cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	hospital and icu length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were comparable .
cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	sofa scores over the first 2 weeks in the icu indicate more severe organ failure in the noninfluenza group ( p = 0.017 ) .
cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	hospital mortality was significantly higher in the noninfluenza group ( 77 vs. 39 % , p = 0.016 ) .
cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	the noninfluenza group tended to have higher overall charges , including significantly higher cost of blood products in the icu .
cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	conclusions : ali / ards secondary to pandemic influenza infection is associated with more severe respiratory compromise but has lower overall acuity and better survival rates than ali / ards due to other causes .
cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	higher absolute charges in the noninfluenza group are likely due to underlying comorbid medical conditions .
f25fde80df624acbc1d0c9268aa7725a25036fb8	we propose a mathematical model based on probability theory to optimize covid-19 testing by a multi - step batch testing approach with variable batch sizes .
f25fde80df624acbc1d0c9268aa7725a25036fb8	this model and simulation tool dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of the tests in a large population at a low cost .

eeb09181c7e8cd16c5183bc520b3a2fe4fb946e4	the animals were rehydrated with an orally administered solution containing electrolytes and glucose .
eeb09181c7e8cd16c5183bc520b3a2fe4fb946e4	thereafter the calves received one test meal of whole fresh cow 's milk whose lactose had been hydrolysed by added lactase and one test meal of unprocessed cow 's milk at an interval of 24 h in a cross - over design trial .
eeb09181c7e8cd16c5183bc520b3a2fe4fb946e4	in comparison with unprocessed milk , the intake of milk containing hydrolysed lactose resulted in a slight decrease of mean breath hydrogen concentration ( p = 0.18 ) , but also a slight decrease of mean blood galactose concentration ( p = 0.14 ) .
eeb09181c7e8cd16c5183bc520b3a2fe4fb946e4	there was no treatment effect on mean plasma glucose concentration .
eeb09181c7e8cd16c5183bc520b3a2fe4fb946e4	peak plasma glucose and blood galactose concentration tended to be delayed after the intake of lactose - hydrolysed milk , which implies that gastric emptying was probably delayed .
eeb09181c7e8cd16c5183bc520b3a2fe4fb946e4	the results show that feeding milk which contains hydrolysed lactose does not significantly improve lactose utilization in calves that are suffering from benign infectious diarrhoea .

054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	immigration legal services providers ( isps ) are a principal source of support for low - income immigrants seeking immigration benefits .
054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	yet there is scant quantitative evidence on the prevalence and geographic distribution of isps in the united states .
054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	to fill this gap , we construct a comprehensive , nationwide database of 2,138 geocoded isp offices that offer low - or no - cost legal services to low - income immigrants .
054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	we use spatial optimization methods to analyze the geographic network of isps and measure isps ' proximity to the low - income immigrant population .
054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	because both isps and immigrants are highly concentrated in major urban areas , most low - income immigrants live close to an isp .
054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	however , we also find a sizable fraction of low - income immigrants in underserved areas , which are primarily in midsize cities in the south .
054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	this reflects both a general skew in non - governmental organization service provision and the more recent arrival of immigrants in these largely southern destinations .
054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	finally , our optimization analysis suggests significant gains from placing new isps in underserved areas to maximize the number of low - income immigrants who live near an isp .
054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	overall , our results provide vital information to immigrants , funders , and policymakers about the current state of the isp network and opportunities to improve it .
b022afc799e4faea03c71335a62fbda966751dcf	in late 2019 , a queer type of pneumonia emerged in wuhan city in the central part of china .
b022afc799e4faea03c71335a62fbda966751dcf	on investigation , it was found to be caused by the coronavirus .
b022afc799e4faea03c71335a62fbda966751dcf	human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s .
b022afc799e4faea03c71335a62fbda966751dcf	there are a total of seven types of coronaviruses that infect humans :
b022afc799e4faea03c71335a62fbda966751dcf	229e and nl63 are the alpha coronaviruses ; oc43 , hku1 , mers - cov , and sars - cov are beta coronaviruses , and sars - cov-2 or covid-19 is a novel coronavirus .
b022afc799e4faea03c71335a62fbda966751dcf	covid-19 surfaced in china at the culmination of the year 2019 .
b022afc799e4faea03c71335a62fbda966751dcf	the pandemic then fanned out rapidly , involving italy , japan , south korea , iran , and the rest of the world .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	the detection and separation of small biomolecules from complex mixtures and the possibility of their recovering for further analyses have great benefits for the early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	developing simple , sensitive , and cost - effective tools that allow the rapid and accurate assembly and isolation of molecular biomarkers has the potential to improve both patient care and hospital logistic efficiency towards personalized and affordable treatments of diseases .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	in this work , we presenta method consisting ofuv - vis - spectroscopy assisted - magnetophoresis for the monitoring of dna hybridization .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	for this purpose , a magnetic device generating 7.5 t / m uniform magnetic field gradient was designed and incorporated to a commercial spectrophotometer .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	different batches of colloidal superparamagnetic particles ( smps ) , with different elemental compositions , were functionalized with twenty - mer complementary oligonucleotides , tb1 and tb2 .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	when the functionalized smps - tb1 and smps - tb2 are mixed and incubated , the hybridization process of tb1 and tb2 occurs resulting in the formation of colloidal aggregates .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	when brought under the magnetic field , depending on the magnetic strength ( γ ) of the formed aggregates , they separate either faster or slower than the non - functionalized smps .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	the difference in magnetic separation time ( δt ) is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the suspension at specific wavelengths .
1f778b09d0ae1add698e80d900a6bccde4a5261d	the detection of aggregates at concentrations of 0.001 % w / v was achieved , showing |δt| ranging from 113−228 s. based on the changes of δt , the study addresses how electrosteric , magnetic , and hydrogen bonding interactions affect the hybridization process and suggests optimum experimental conditions for accurate monitoring of tb1-tb2 hybridization .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	the high morbidity and mortality of covid-19 in immunocompetent patients raises significant concern for immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients ( ktrs ) .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	this level of concern , both on the part of the ktrs and transplant professionals , is heightened by a lack of prior knowledge on how sars - cov-2 may manifest differently in immunosuppressed patients .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	characterizing how ktrs may present differently than the general population would allow for more targeted and timely evaluation and treatment of ktrs with covid-19 infection .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	methods :
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	without prior knowledge of how this virus would affect our transplant center 's delivery of care to ktrs who are sars - cov-2 positive or patients under investigation ( puis ) , and in the setting of limited testing availability , we initiated a quality assurance and improvement project ( qapi ) to track ktrs followed at our transplant center through the sars - cov-2 testing process .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	results :
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	of the 53 symptomatic patients , 20 ( 38 % ) tested positive for sars - cov-2 either on presentation to the emergency department , or referral to a designated outpatient testing center .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	in addition , 16 ( 80 % ) of the 20 patients who tested positive required inpatient treatment .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	intriguingly , patients with a history of polyoma bk viremia ( bkv ) had a higher incidence of testing positive for sars - cov-2 compared to patients without history of bkv ( 80 % and 28 % , respectively ; p= 0.002 ) .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	the positive predictive value and likelihood ratio was 80 % and 6.6 for this association , respectively .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	among our ktrs tested , those receiving belatacept had a lower likelihood of testing positive for sars - cov-2 .
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	this finding approached , but did not achieve , statistical significance ( p=0.06 ) .

7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	the covid-19 outbreak has influenced the entire health care system , including cardiac surgery .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	in this review , the authors reveal practical aspects that are important during the covid-19 pandemic with regards to the safe delivery of cardiac anesthesia .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	timing for operations of the cardio - vascular system may be well programmed , in most cases .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	hence , the level of priorities must be defined for any single patient .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	the postponement of surgery may be convenient for most cases , if it is made in the best interest of the patient .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	the preanesthetic evaluation should keep attention to the respiratory history of the patient .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	cardiac anesthesia is always implying some respiratory monitoring ; hence the existing clinical situation of the patient 's respiratory system should be clear .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	in case of emergency surgery , the patient should be treated as if they potentially have or are at risk for the virus .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	in the case of a covid-19 confirmed or suspected patient , attention must be made to preserve operating room and team integrity .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	the machineries are to be draped with plastic , in order to simplify the disinfection after the operation .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	perioperative management of suspected or confirmed covid-19 patients must strictly follow the most relevant international guidelines .
7a254cb6951239f39bb9a1d9cd1bc5200703b4c2	this review article has synthesized the common aspect present in the most important of these .
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pandemic poses several challenges to the management of patients with leukemia .
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	the biology of each leukemia and its corresponding treatment with conventional intensive chemotherapy , with or without targeted therapies ( venetoclax , flt3 inhibitors ,
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	idh1/2 inhibitors , bruton 's tyrosine kinase inhibitors ) , introduce additional layers of complexity during covid-19 highrisk periods .
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	the knowledge about covid-19 is accumulating rapidly .
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	an important distinction is the prevalence of " exposure " versus " clinical infectivity , " which determine the risk versus benefit of modifying potentially highly curative therapies in leukemia .
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	at present , the rate of clinical infection is < 1 - 2 % worldwide .
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	with a mortality rate of 1 - 5 % in co - vid-19 patients in the general population and potentially of > 30 % in patients with cancer , careful consideration should be given to the risk of covid-19 in leukemia .
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	instead of reducing patient access to specialized cancer centers and modifying therapies to ones with unproven curative benefit , there is more rationale for less intensive , yet effective therapies that may require fewer clinic visits or hospitalizations .
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	here , we offer recommendations on the optimization of leukemia management during high - risk covid-19 periods .
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	cystatins are thiol proteinase inhibitors ( tpi ) , present ubiquitously in animals , plants and microorganisms .
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	these are not merely inhibitors rather they are at heart of many pathological conditions ranging from diabetes to renal failure .
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	these are essential for maintenance of protein balance of the cell ; once this balance gets disturbed , it may lead to cell death .
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	thus , cystatins can not be merely regarded as tpi 's as these have been found to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases .
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	many studies have reported the variation in cystatin level in incidences of different types of cancer ; highlighting an important role played by these inhibitors in cancer development and progression .
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	cystatin c is increasingly replacing creatinine as a biomarker of glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) thereby highlighting the importance of this important inhibitor .
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	some recent studies have also reported the interaction pattern of various anti - cancer drugs with cystatins in a bid to find how these drugs affect this important inhibitors and whether these drugs have any side effect on cystatins .
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	thus , in this growing disease era it can be said that cystatins are no more just inhibitors blocking the activity of thiol proteases rather they play a pivotal role in variety of pathological conditions .

1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a chimeric alphavirus vaccine candidate in mice with selective immunodeficiencies .
1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	this vaccine candidate was highly attenuated in mice with deficiencies in the b and t cell compartments , as well as in mice with deficient gamma - interferon responsiveness .
1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	however , the level of protection varied among the strains tested .
1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	wild type mice were protected against lethal veev challenge .
1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	in contrast , alpha / beta ( αβ ) tcr - deficient mice developed lethal encephalitis following veev challenge , while mice deficient in gamma / delta ( γδ )
1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	t cells were protected .
1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	surprisingly , the vaccine potency was diminished by 50 % in animals lacking interferon - gamma receptor alpha chain (
1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	r1)-chain and a minority of vaccinated immunoglobulin heavy chain - deficient ( μmt ) mice survived challenge , which suggests that neutralizing antibody may not be absolutely required for protection .
1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	prolonged replication of encephalitic veev in the brain of pre - immunized mice is not lethal and adoptive transfer experiments indicate that cd3 + t cells are required for protection .

52030e1595b92b33f1019859585ba58819fcefcb	sars - cov-2 encodes three putative ion channels : e , 8a , and 3a .
52030e1595b92b33f1019859585ba58819fcefcb	in related sars - cov-1 , 3a is implicated in viral release , inflammasome activation , and cell death and its deletion reduces viral titer and morbidity in animal models , suggesting 3a - targeted therapeutics could treat sars and covid-19 .
52030e1595b92b33f1019859585ba58819fcefcb	however , the structural basis for the function of 3a is unknown .
52030e1595b92b33f1019859585ba58819fcefcb	here , we show that sars - cov-2 3a forms large conductance cation channels and present cryo - em structures of dimeric and tetrameric 3a in lipid nanodiscs .
52030e1595b92b33f1019859585ba58819fcefcb	3a adopts a novel fold and is captured in a closed or inactivated state .

52030e1595b92b33f1019859585ba58819fcefcb	3a function is conserved in a common variant among circulating sars - cov-2 that alters the channel pore .
52030e1595b92b33f1019859585ba58819fcefcb	we identify 3a - like proteins in all alphaand beta - coronaviruses that infect bats and humans , suggesting therapeutics targeting 3a could treat a range of coronaviral diseases .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( prrs ) has devastated pig industries worldwide for many years .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	it is caused by a small rna virus ( prrsv ) , which targets almost exclusively pig monocytes or macrophages .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	in the present study , five sage ( serial analysis of gene expression ) libraries derived from 0 hour mock - infected and 6 , 12 , 16 and 24 hours prrsvinfected porcine alveolar macrophages ( pams ) produced a total 643,255 sequenced tags with 91,807 unique tags .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	differentially expressed ( de ) tags were then detected using the bayesian framework followed by gene / mrna assignment , arbitrary selection and manual annotation , which determined 699 de genes for reactome analysis .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	the david , kegg and reactome databases assigned 573 of the de genes into six biological systems , 60 functional categories and 504 pathways .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	the six systems are : cellular processes , genetic information processing , environmental information processing , metabolism , organismal systems and human diseases as defined by kegg with modification .

ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	based on the number one functional category in each system , cell growth and death , transcription processes , signal transductions , energy metabolism , immune system and infectious diseases formed the major reactomes of pams responding to prrsv infection .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	our investigation also focused on dominant pathways that had at least 20 de genes identified , multi - pathway genes that were involved in 10 or more pathways and exclusively - expressed genes that were included in one system .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	overall , our present study reported a large set of de genes , compiled a comprehensive coverage of pathways , and revealed systembased reactomes of pams infected with prrsv .
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	we believe that our reactome data provides new insight into molecular mechanisms involved in host genetic complexity of antiviral activities against prrsv and lays a strong foundation for vaccine development to control prrs incidence in pigs .

b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	background :
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	inappropriate use of antibiotics increases resistance and reduces their effectiveness .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	despite evidencebased guidelines , antibiotics are still commonly used to treat infections likely caused by respiratory viruses .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	in this study , we examined the temporal relationships between antibiotic usage and respiratory infections in the republic of korea .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	methods :
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	the number of monthly antibiotic prescriptions and the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections between 2010 and 2015 at all primary care clinics were obtained from the korean health insurance review and assessment service .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	the monthly detection rates of respiratory viruses , including adenovirus , respiratory syncytial virus , influenza virus , human coronavirus , and human rhinovirus , were collected from korea centers for disease control and prevention .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	cross - correlation analysis was conducted to quantify the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and respiratory virus activities as well as respiratory infections in primary clinics .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	results :
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	the monthly use of different classes of antibiotic , including penicillins , other beta - lactam antibacterials , macrolides and quinolones , was significantly correlated with influenza virus activity .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	these correlations peaked at the 0-month lag with cross - correlation coefficients of 0.45 ( p < 0.01 ) , 0.46
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	( p < 0.01 ) , 0.40 ( p < 0.01 ) , and 0.35 ( < 0.01 ) , respectively .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	furthermore , a significant correlation was found between acute bronchitis and antibiotics , including penicillin ( 0.73 , p < 0.01 ) , macrolides ( 0.74 , p < 0.01 ) , and quinolones ( 0.45 , p < 0.01 ) , at the 0-month lag .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	conclusions :
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	our findings suggest that there is a significant temporal relationship between influenza virus activity and antibiotic use in primary clinics .
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	this relationship indicates that interventions aimed at reducing influenza cases in addition to effort to discourage the prescription of antibiotics by physicians may help to decrease unnecessary antibiotic consumption .
efde489f714f11bc87ce338652add37531b65ad9	rt - lamp detection of sars - cov-2 has been shown as a valuable approach to scale up covid-19 diagnostics and thus contribute to limiting the spread of the disease .
efde489f714f11bc87ce338652add37531b65ad9	here we present the optimization of highly cost - effective in - house produced enzymes , and we benchmark their performance against commercial alternatives .
efde489f714f11bc87ce338652add37531b65ad9	we explore the compatibility between multiple dna polymerases with high strand - displacement activity and thermostable reverse transcriptases required for rt - lamp .
efde489f714f11bc87ce338652add37531b65ad9	we optimize reaction conditions and demonstrate their applicability using both synthetic rna and clinical patient samples .
efde489f714f11bc87ce338652add37531b65ad9	finally , we validated the optimized rt - lamp assay for the detection of sars - cov-2 in raw nasopharyngeal samples from 184 patients .
efde489f714f11bc87ce338652add37531b65ad9	we anticipate that optimized and affordable reagents for rt - lamp will facilitate the expansion of sars - cov-2 testing globally , especially in sites and settings with limited economic resources .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	sustainability certification schemes such as fairtrade , flo , wfto and ft - usa have gained increasing markets .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	the significant growth of the fair trade ( ft ) movement in the last decades draws attention to ethical consumption .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	ft 's aim at improving the livelihoods of producers in developing countries and promotion of social change is considered a model that shows the benefits of trade to development .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	although conveying a large number of publications , not all questions about the movement are explored .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	the literature is prolific on coffee , cacao , flowers , wine , and gold .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	in contrast , the engagement with staple foods -a prominent globally traded food category -seems minor .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	the primary objective of this review was to map the existing literature about ft and staple foods ; then , to investigate the role of staple foods in the ft movement .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	the search strategy was designed to retrieve publications on the intersection of ft and staple foods .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	to date , there is no review about ft and staple foods nexus .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	our systematic review addressed this gap considering ft as an alternative capable of addressing unsustainable food consumption and production impacts .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	our research protocol included keywords searching across four databases , screening , and comparative analysis .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	from 283 documents retrieved , 49 were deemed relevant to reflect the role of staple foods in the ft movement .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	this systematic review discusses challenges and opportunities for the ft model to further engage with staples and recommends improvement of its environmental credentials .
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	the present study can contribute by informing decision makers , policy makers , businesses , ngos , producers , and consumers .
16e0d6a1e48d067c51d6142249d852696ff9adc4	the peak of the daily new infections in covid-19 remained qualitative in description and elusive in arrival .
16e0d6a1e48d067c51d6142249d852696ff9adc4	because of the lack of clarity in what to expect from the peak , apart from the hope that one day the peak will be reached , there has been no metric to describe the success of the implemented strategies .
16e0d6a1e48d067c51d6142249d852696ff9adc4	we propose a way of predicting the number of infections that can be expected after a lockdown , assuming they come from the asymptomatic cases prior to the lockdown and using linear response theory .
16e0d6a1e48d067c51d6142249d852696ff9adc4	these predictions for several western countries faithfully follow the observed infections for several weeks after the lockdown , suggesting universalities in the recovery pattern of several countries .
16e0d6a1e48d067c51d6142249d852696ff9adc4	at the same time , the gap between the quantitative predictions of the recovery patterns for new york and milan and the observations is striking .
16e0d6a1e48d067c51d6142249d852696ff9adc4	these gaps which arise even while emulating the recovery patterns of other western countries raise the possibility of an audit of the success of the implemented strategies , and the potential newer sources of infection .
c1f8df65b2c0cc3ead7d7bcf94732cc68b472e64	the interferon ( ifn ) response is a powerful system that was evolutionarily acquired by vertebrates including mammals to protect against viral infection .
c1f8df65b2c0cc3ead7d7bcf94732cc68b472e64	the cytoplasmic rna helicases , rig - i - like receptors ( rlrs ) , were discovered in 2004 as viral sensors that trigger the antiviral ifn response by recognizing the nonself signatures of viral rnas .
c1f8df65b2c0cc3ead7d7bcf94732cc68b472e64	the mechanisms underlying the recognition of viral rnas and signal transduction leading to the production of type i ifn have been intensively studied following the discovery of rlrs .
c1f8df65b2c0cc3ead7d7bcf94732cc68b472e64	moreover , a dysregulation in the expression of rlr or aberrant rlr signaling has been implicated in the development of a number of autoimmune diseases .
c1f8df65b2c0cc3ead7d7bcf94732cc68b472e64	we herein provide an overview of recent advances in rlr research and discussed future directions .
