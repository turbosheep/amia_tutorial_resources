4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	( usp18 ) encodes a protein that negatively regulates t1 ifn signaling via stearic inhibition of jak1 recruitment to the ifn - receptor 2 subunit ( ifnar2 ) .
4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	here , we demonstrate that usp18 expression is induced by hiv-1 in a t1 ifn - dependent manner .
4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	in the absence of usp18 , macrophages have increased responsiveness to stimulation with t1 ifns with prolonged phosphorylation of stat1 and stat2 and increased expression of ifn - stimulated genes that are key for antiviral responses .
4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	interestingly , hiv-1 requires some signaling through the t1 ifn receptor to replicate efficiently because a neutralizing antibody that inhibits t1 ifn activity reduces hiv-1 replication rate in monocyte - derived macrophages .
4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	usp18 induction by hiv-1 tunes the ifn response to optimal levels allowing for efficient transcription from the hiv-1 ltr promoter while minimizing the t1 ifn - induced antiviral response that would otherwise restrict viral replication and spread .

646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	we expressed the antiviral lectin griffithsin ( grft ) , which shows potent neutralizing activity against hiv , in the endosperm of transgenic rice plants ( oryza sativa ) , to determine whether rice can be used to produce inexpensive grft as a microbicide ingredient .
646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	the yield of os grft in the best - performing plants was 223 lg / g dry seed weight .
646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	os grft bound to hiv glycans with similar efficiency to grft produced in escherichia coli .
646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	wholecell assays using purified os grft and infectivity assays using crude extracts of transgenic rice endosperm confirmed that both crude and pure os grft showed potent activity against hiv and the crude extracts were not toxic towards human cell lines , suggesting they could be administered as a microbicide with only minimal processing .
646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	a freedom - to - operate analysis confirmed that grft produced in rice is suitable for commercial development , and an economic evaluation suggested that 1.8 kg / ha of pure grft could be produced from rice seeds .
646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	our data therefore indicate that rice could be developed as an inexpensive production platform for grft as a microbicide component .

a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	to this end , this paper develops a bayesian model for predicting the effects of covid-19 lockdown policies in a global context -we treat each country as a distinct data point , and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country - specific policy effects .
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	our model utilizes a two - layer gaussian process ( gp )
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	prior -the lower layer uses a compartmental seir ( susceptible , exposed , infected , recovered ) model as a prior mean function with " country - andpolicy - specific " parameters that capture fatality curves under " counterfactual " policies within each country , whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries , and learns lower - layer seir parameters as a function of a country 's features and its policy indicators .
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of seir models ( bayesian priors ) with the flexible data - driven modeling and gradient - based optimization routines of machine learning ( bayesian posteriors )
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	we compare the projections of covid-19 fatalities by our model with other models listed by the center for disease control ( cdc ) , and provide scenario analyses for various lockdown and reopening strategies highlighting their impact on covid-19 fatalities .
0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	the covid-19 pandemic has reduced radiology volumes across the country as providers have decreased elective care in order to minimize the spread of infection and free up health care delivery system capacity .
0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	given the substantial differences in severity and timing of the disease in different geographic regions , estimating resumption of radiology volumes will be one of the next major challenges for radiology practices .
0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	we hypothesize that there are 6 major variables that will likely predict radiology volumes : ( 1 ) severity of disease in the local region , including potential subsequent " waves " of infection , ( 2 ) lifting of government social distancing restrictions , ( 3 ) patient concern regarding risk of leaving home and entering imaging facilities , ( 4 ) management of pent up demand for imaging delayed during the acute phase of the pandemic , including institutional capacity , ( 5 ) impact of the economic downturn on health insurance and ability to pay for imaging , and ( 6 ) radiology practice profile reflecting amount of elective imaging performed , including type of patients seen by the radiology practice such as emergency / inpatient / outpatient mix and sub - specialty types .
91e5ea899411aef9fec0bd446286623ceef533ca	noroviruses are the leading cause of epidemic non - bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide .
91e5ea899411aef9fec0bd446286623ceef533ca	despite their discovery over three decades ago , little is known about the host immune response to norovirus infection .
91e5ea899411aef9fec0bd446286623ceef533ca	the purpose of this chapter is to review the field of norovirus immunology and discuss the contributions of outbreak investigations , human and animal challenge studies and population - based studies .
91e5ea899411aef9fec0bd446286623ceef533ca	this chapter will survey both humoral and cellular immunity as well as recent advances in norovirus vaccine development .

683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	background : wu virus ( wuv ) and ki polyomavirus ( kipyv ) are newly discovered related human polyomaviruses detected in respiratory samples .
683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	to investigate their potential role in respiratory disease , we determined their frequencies of detection , clinical presentations and epidemiological characteristics among samples referred for diagnostic respiratory virus testing .
683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	samples were screened by nested pcr using two sets of primers conserved between wuv and kipyv , as well for other respiratory viruses ( respiratory syncytial virus [ rsv ] , adenoviruses [ adv ] , influenza a / b and parainfluenza viruses 1 - 3 , human bocavirus , b19 ) .
683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	infections occurred in two types of study subject ; those who were young ( < 2 years ) with lower respiratory tract infections ( n = 8) , and almost invariably co - infected with other respiratory viruses ( rsv , adv ) , and a second , generally older group either without respiratory disease ( n = 6 ) or with mild upper respiratory tract infections ( n = 5 ) but who were generally clinically severely immunosuppressed from leukaemia or transplant therapy .
683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	findings from either group do not support an aetiological link between infection with wuv or kipyv and respiratory disease .

03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	the objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings ( commercial meat , companion , laboratory , and shelter ) and to identify how factors such as age , season , and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	a total of 86 pooled commercial meat , 54 companion , 14 pooled laboratory , and 14 shelter rabbit fecal samples were evaluated using 16s rrna gene sequencing of the v4 region .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	despite causing pandemics and yearly epidemics that result in significant morbidity and mortality , our arsenal of options to treat influenza a virus ( iav ) infections remains limited and is challenged by the virus itself .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	while vaccination is the preferred intervention strategy against influenza , its efficacy is reduced in the elderly and infants who are most susceptible to severe and/or fatal infections .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	in addition , antigenic variation of iav complicates the production of efficacious vaccines .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	similarly , effectiveness of currently used antiviral drugs is jeopardized by the development of resistance to these drugs .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	like many viruses , iav is reliant on host factors and signaling - pathways for its replication , which could potentially offer alternative options to treat infections .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	while host - factors have long been recognized as attractive therapeutic candidates against other viruses , only recently they have been targeted for development as iav antivirals .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	future strategies to combat iav infections will most likely include approaches that alter host - virus interactions on the one hand or dampen harmful host immune responses on the other , with the use of biological response modifiers ( brms ) .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	in principle , brms are biologically active agents including antibodies , small peptides , and/or other ( small ) molecules that can influence the immune response .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	brms are already being used in the clinic to treat malignancies and autoimmune diseases .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	repurposing such agents would allow for accelerated use against severe and potentially fatal iav infections .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	in this review , we will address the potential therapeutic use of different brm classes to modulate the immune response induced after iav infections .

2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	however , unlike traditional big data systems , data structures processed by streaming apis like java 8 streams typically reside in shared memory accessed by multiple cores .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	therefore , issues may arise from the close intimacy between shared memory and the operations being performed , especially for developers not previously familiar with functional programming .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	streams are not just an api but rather an emerging , hybrid paradigm .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	to obtain the expressiveness , speed , and parallelism that streams have to offer , developers must adopt the paradigm as well as the api [ 6 , ch . 7 ] .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	this requires determining whether running stream code in parallel yields an efficient yet interference - free program [ 24 ] and ensuring that no operations on different threads interleave [ 42 ] .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	in general , the results ( i ) advance our understanding of this emerging hybrid paradigm , ( ii ) provide feedback to language and api designers for future api versions ,
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease with first symptoms similar to the flu .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	covid-19 appeared first in china and very quickly spreads to the rest of the world , causing then the 2019 - 20 coronavirus pandemic .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	in many cases , this disease causes pneumonia .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	since pulmonary infections can be observed through radiography images , this paper investigates deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest x - ray images with the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the covid-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	in this context , training datasets , deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from publicly open sets of chest x - ray images .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	tailored deep learning models are proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases , notably viral cases .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	it is assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic covid-19 context have a high probability to presume covid-19 infections .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	moreover , easyto - apply health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting patient status from the detected pneumonia cases .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	experimental results show possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest x - ray images towards screening viral pneumonia .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	chest x - ray test images of covid-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models retained for their performances .
7cf2d394e5b60d11cd8c7abe1f4416ec884f0ab1	as of july 14 th , covid-19 has caused in italy 34.984 deaths and 243.344 infection cases .
7cf2d394e5b60d11cd8c7abe1f4416ec884f0ab1	assuming a seasonal regime for covid-19 , we tested different lockdown policies .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	an economic network can be examined at many levels - linkages among individual agents ( microscopic ) , among firms / sectors ( mesoscopic ) or among countries ( macroscopic ) .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	for viral epidemics , even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and potentially affect the entire network .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	surfaces in congregate settings , such as vehicles used for mass transportation , can become contaminated with infectious microorganisms and facilitate disease transmission .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	we disinfected surfaces contaminated with h1n1 influenza viruses using hydrogen peroxide ( hp ) vapor at concentrations below 100 ppm and triethylene glycol ( teg)-saturated air containing 2 ppm of teg at 258c. methodsinfluenza viruses in aqueous suspensions were deposited on stainless - steel coupons , allowed to dry at ambient conditions , and then exposed for up to 15 minutes to 10 to 90 ppm of hp vapor or teg - saturated air .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	virus assays were done on the solution used to wash the viruses from these coupons and from coupons treated similarly but without exposure to hp or teg vapor .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	for air saturated with teg at 25 to 298c , the disinfection rate was about 1.3 log 10 reductions per hour , about 16 times faster than the measured natural inactivation rate under ambient conditions .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) is an economically devastating enteric disease in the swine industry .

97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	therefore , our goal in this study was to quantify pedv specific iga and igg b cell responses in sows at approximately 1 and 6 months post - infection in commercial swine herds , including parity one and higher sows .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	our data indicated that evaluation of both pedv specific iga and igg antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid ( but not feces ) samples is beneficial in disease diagnosis .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	pedv specific b cell response in the intestine and spleen of infected sows decline by 6 months , and this associates with specific antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid samples ; but the virus neutralization titers in plasma remains high beyond 6 months post - infection .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	in conclusion , in sows infected with pedv the presence of effector / memory b cell response and strong virus neutralization titers in plasma up to 6 months postinfection , suggests their potential to protect sows from reinfection and provide maternal immunity to neonates , but challenge studies are required to confirm such responses .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	infectious or contagious diseases can be transmitted from one person to another through social contact networks .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	in today 's interconnected global society , such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards , as exemplified by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	it is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the network transmission of contagious diseases from the perspective of statistical inference .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	an important and widely studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the so - called epidemic threshold .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	the second approximation , which is based on random walk sampling , further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small fraction of nodes .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	in an era of increased interest in biodefence pathogens and emerging diseases , immunological analysis has developed rapidly alongside traditional techniques in virology and molecular biology .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	the luminex microsphere system allows for the detection of many cytokines and chemokines in a single sample , but the detection method of using aligned lasers and fluidics means that samples often have to be analysed in low containment facilities .

3d9b12f988b9c3311cbdf8a19c56ce343d91d210	the sepsis - induced immunodepression contributes to impaired clinical outcomes of various stress conditions .
3d9b12f988b9c3311cbdf8a19c56ce343d91d210	this syndrome is well documented and characterized by attenuated function of innate and adaptive immune cells .
3d9b12f988b9c3311cbdf8a19c56ce343d91d210	several pharmacological interventions aimed to restore the immune response are emerging of which interferon - gamma ( ifnÎ³ ) is one .
3d9b12f988b9c3311cbdf8a19c56ce343d91d210	the data collected in 18 adults and 2 liver transplanted pediatric patients were : clinical scores , monocyte expression of hla - dr ( flow cytometry ) , lymphocyte immune - phenotyping ( flow cytometry ) , il-6 and il-10 plasma levels ( elisa ) , bacterial cultures , disease severity , and mortality .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	to date , no drugs or vaccines have been employed to improve clinical outcomes for rsv - infected patients .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	in this paper , we report that angiotensin - converting enzyme-2 ( ace2 ) protected against severe lung injury induced by rsv infection in an experimental mouse model and in pediatric patients .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	moreover , ace2 deficiency aggravated rsv - associated disease pathogenesis , mainly by its action on the angiotensin ii type 1 receptor ( at1r ) .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	these findings demonstrate that ace2 plays a critical role in preventing rsv - induced lung injury , and suggest that ace2 is a promising potential therapeutic target in the management of rsv - induced lung disease .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	human respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is a non - segmented , negative - sense , single - stranded rna virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	rsv is the most common virus responsible for acute and severe lower airway diseases in infants and young children , with nearly all children experiencing at least one rsv infection by the age of 2 years 1 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	according to the world health organization ( who ) , approximately 34 million new pediatric cases of rsv - associated lower airway disease occur annually worldwide ; most cases occur in developing countries , with a mortality rate of nearly 200,000 annually 2,3 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	despite the significant impact of rsv infection on infant morbidity and mortality , treatment options remain largely limited to supportive care 4 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	currently , ribavirin is the only antiviral drug that has been approved for treatment of rsv - infected airway diseases , although issues with its efficacy and side effects restrict its application in immunocompromised patients 5 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	the high incidence of rsv infection and its potential to cause severe respiratory tract disease in vulnerable young children , combined with the limited availability of therapeutic options , highlight an urgent unmet global human health need .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) plays a major role in maintaining blood pressure , and electrolyte and fluid homeostasis 6 - 8 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	in 2000 , ace2 , a homolog of the angiotensin - converting enzyme
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	( ace ) gene was reported to negatively regulate ras by converting angiotensin ( ang)-ii to ang-1 - 7 9 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	previous studies , from our group and others , have demonstrated that ace2 protects against severe acute lung injury ( ali ) that can be triggered by sepsis , acid aspiration , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , and the lethal avian influenza a h5n1 virus 10 - 12 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	moreover , ace2 has been identified as the receptor of the sars coronavirus 11 , and has also been found to modulate innate immunity and influence the composition of gut microbiota 13 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	more importantly , a recombinant ace2 protein has proven to be effective in improving lung pathologies associated with ali and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) induced by viruses including sars and influenza 12 , 14 , 15 .

a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	the capacity of current molecular testing convention does not allow high - throughput and community level scans of covid-19 infections .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	the diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	currently proposed covid-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10x scale - up .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row - column group testing or reed - solomon error correcting codes .

d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	sars - cov n is released from cells through an association with e protein - containing vesicles .
d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	changing all three e cysteine residues to alanines did not exert negative effects on e release , e association with n , or e enhancement of vlp production , suggesting that e palmitoylation modification or disulfide bond formation is not required for sars - cov virus assembly .
d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	we found that removal of the last e carboxyl - terminal residue markedly affected e release , n association , and vlp incorporation , but did not significantly compromise the contribution of e to efficient vlp production .
d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	the independence of the sars - cov e enhancement effect on vlp production from its viral packaging capacity suggests a distinct sars - cov e role in virus assembly .

d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	with new cases of covid-19 surging in the united states , we need to better understand how the spread of novel coronavirus varies across all segments of the population .
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	we use hierarchical exponential growth curve modeling techniques to examine whether community social and economic characteristics uniquely influence the incidence of covid-19 cases in the urban built environment .
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	we show that , as of may 3 , 2020 , confirmed coronavirus infections are concentrated along demographic and socioeconomic lines in new york city and surrounding areas , the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic in the united states .
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	furthermore , we see evidence that , after the onset of the pandemic , timely enactment of physical distancing measures such as school closures is imperative in order to limit the extent of the coronavirus spread in the population .

27d47347e18de0e85c9de145ab9b4f95b11601a1	coronavirus particles were identified in pneumocytes by electron microscopy .
27d47347e18de0e85c9de145ab9b4f95b11601a1	the predominant pathological process of sars is diffuse alveolar damage and , in patients who die from the disease , there is evidence of organization and fibrosis .
27d47347e18de0e85c9de145ab9b4f95b11601a1	there are apparently no histological features specific for this disease , and the aetiological diagnosis depends on virological and ultrastructural studies .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	background : severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus ( sftsv ) , which can cause hemorrhagic fever - like illness , is a newly discovered bunyavirus in china .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	however , it has been suggested that immune mechanisms , including cytokines and chemokines , play an important role in disease pathogenesis .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	in the present study , we investigated host cytokine and chemokine profiles in serum samples of patients with sftsv infection from northeast china and explored a possible correlation between cytokine levels and disease severity .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	patients were divided into two groups -severe or non - severe -based on disease severity .

3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	statistical analysis showed that increases in tnf - a ,
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	ip-10 and ifn - c were associated with disease severity .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	we suggest that a cytokine - mediated inflammatory response , characterized by cytokine and chemokine production imbalance , might be in part responsible for the disease progression of patients with sftsv infection .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	zika virus ( zikv ) is a highly transmissive virus that belongs to the flaviviridae family , which comprises several other pathogens that threaten human health .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	this re - emerging virus gained attention during the outbreak in brazil in 2016 , where a considerable number of microcephaly cases in newborns was associated with zikv infection during pregnancy .

a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	the data presented show a clear antiviral effect of two compounds that target the same compartments in different ways .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	this highlights the relevance of the endosomal - lysosomal compartment for the viral life cycle that should be considered as a target for antivirals .

a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	after internalization via receptor - mediated endocytosis , it is assumed that the acidification of the late endosomes , also termed multivesicular bodies ( mvbs ) , promotes a structural change in the viral envelope , allowing the fusion between the endosomal membrane and the envelope .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	in this immature form , the pr peptide covers approximately 12 amino acids of the fusion loop of the envelope protein and , thus , prevents premature fusion within the cell .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	in the trans - golgi network ( tgn ) , the viral particle undergoes maturation as a result of a structural modification induced by the low ph that allows the cleavage of the prm by a furin - like protease , exposing the fusion loop .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	lastly , the infectious viral particle exits the cell by exocytosis and the pr fragment dissociates from the virion due to the neutral

a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	concerning the sh - sy5y cells , bafilomycin a1 decreased zikv entry .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	in the second part of this study , the functionality of the late endosomes and lysosomes was hindered by the amphipathic steroid drug , u18666a. u18666a inhibits the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol and lipids by the direct inhibition of the niemann - pick type c protein .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	several reports showed that u18666a inhibits crucial steps of dengue virus , hepatitis c virus , ebola virus and feline coronavirus life cycles [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] .

42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	the estimated age - specific ifrs are close to zero for children and younger adults but rise to about 0.3 percent for ages 50 - 59 , 1 percent for ages 60 - 69 , 4 percent for ages 70 - 79 , and 24 percent for ages 80 and above .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	our analysis indicates that the link between ifr and age is far stronger than the link with comorbidities such as chronic pulmonary disease .

42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	furthermore , the overall ifr for covid-19 should not be viewed as an exogenously fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age - specific pattern of infections .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	consequently , individual and collective efforts that minimize infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	in this paper , we consider the hypothesis that the observed variation in ifr across locations may primarily reflect the age specificity of covid-19 infections and fatalities .

77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	we extend a statistical inference method designed for outbreaks caused by one virus to that caused by two viruses .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	the method uses knowledge of which subtype each case is infected with ( and whether they were co - infected ) , contact information and symptom onset date of each case in the influenza outbreak .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	analysis of the constructed transmission tree shows that the simultaneous presence of the two influenza viruses increases the infectivity and the transmissibility of a / h1n1 virus but whether it changes the infectivity of a / h3n2 is unclear .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	the estimation also shows that co - transmission of both subtypes from co - infection is low and therefore co - infection can not be sustained on its own .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	this study suggests that influenza a viruses within co - infected patients can interact in some ways rather than transmit independently , and this can enhance the spread of influenza a virus infection .

3912b80014bfe289bdb7ca30d6ce8c1200e393cb	twenty in - depth qualitative interviews with residents , thematically analysed , found that while people expressed strong environmental self - identity , preferences for air conditioner use was often mediated by hedonic factors such as comfort and sleep .
3912b80014bfe289bdb7ca30d6ce8c1200e393cb	moral norms played a positive role in how people operated their air conditioners .
3912b80014bfe289bdb7ca30d6ce8c1200e393cb	yet , when faced with the choice of using energy - efficient air conditioners , biospheric concern was of limited importance while situational factors like cost and functionality were more pivotal .
3912b80014bfe289bdb7ca30d6ce8c1200e393cb	the above results raise interesting questions around the difficulties that might emerge in changing preferences around air conditioning behaviours in non - environmental communities , especially , if environmentally conscious communities which are expected to be " the locus of change for energy efficiency actions " are significantly influenced by hedonic values .
6ac345a594c2c044fe174c9c1ddd78a8b655b225	this article takes as its starting point the idea that re - emerging infectious disease has become a paradigmatic way of thinking about disease .
6ac345a594c2c044fe174c9c1ddd78a8b655b225	the framing of infectious disease as a threat to global public health and economic security coincides with preemptive forms of control .
6ac345a594c2c044fe174c9c1ddd78a8b655b225	a particular type of preemptive regulation is global pandemic influenza planning that entails the governing of an imminent , albeit uncertain , global health event .
6ac345a594c2c044fe174c9c1ddd78a8b655b225	we present key findings on : the construction of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform and expand across corporeal and territorial boundaries ; and the integration of pandemic preparedness into everyday practices .
6ac345a594c2c044fe174c9c1ddd78a8b655b225	our analysis illustrates how the discourse of preparedness links the justification for population - level preemptive approaches to discursive constructions of the virus .

dd9f7117ce3bc1640a5c01b2371bdd47912dce85	with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral treatments available to prevent dengue infection , dengue is considered a major public health problem in subtropical and tropical regions .
dd9f7117ce3bc1640a5c01b2371bdd47912dce85	the virus , like other enveloped viruses , uses the host 's cellular enzymes to synthesize its structural ( c , e , and prm / m ) and nonstructural proteins ( ns1 - 5 ) and , subsequently , to glycosylate these proteins to produce complete and functional glycoproteins .
dd9f7117ce3bc1640a5c01b2371bdd47912dce85	this review focuses on the involvement of dengue glycoproteins in the course of infection and the virus ' exploitation of the host 's glycans , especially the interactions between host receptors and carbohydrate moieties .
dd9f7117ce3bc1640a5c01b2371bdd47912dce85	we also discuss the recent developments in antiviral therapies that target these processes and interactions , focusing specifically on the use of carbohydrate - binding agents derived from plants , commonly known as lectins , to inhibit the progression of infection .

c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	since 2002 , beta coronaviruses ( cov ) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks , sars - cov in 2002 , mers - cov in 2012 , and the newly emerged sars - cov-2 in late 2019 .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	however , little is currently known about the biology of sars - cov-2 .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	here , using sars - cov-2 s protein pseudovirus system , we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( hace2 ) is the receptor for sars - cov-2 , find that sars - cov-2 enters 293 / hace2 cells mainly through endocytosis , that pikfyve , tpc2 , and cathepsin l are critical for entry , and that sars - cov-2 s protein is less stable than sars - cov s. polyclonal anti - sars s1 antibodies
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	t62 inhibit entry of sars - cov s but not sars - cov-2 s pseudovirions .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	further studies using recovered sars and covid-19 patients ' sera show limited cross - neutralization , suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other .

c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	since beginning of this century , there have already been three zoonotic outbreaks of beta - covs .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	in 2002 - 2003 , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) 3,4 , a lineage b beta - cov , emerged from bat and palm civet 5,6 , and infected over 8000 people and caused about 800 deaths 7 .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	in 2012 , middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) , a lineage c beta - cov , was discovered as the causative agent of a severe respiratory syndrome in saudi arabia 8 , currently with 2494 confirmed cases and 858 deaths 9 , it remains endemic in middle east , and dromedary camel is considered as the zoonotic reservoir host of mers - cov.
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	at the end of 2019 , a novel coronavirus , named sars - cov-2 , was found in patients with severe pneumonia in wuhan , china 10 - 12 .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	viruses were isolated from patients and sequenced .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	phylogenetical analysis revealed that it is a lineage b beta - cov and closely related to a sars - like ( sl ) cov , ratg13 , discovered in a cave of yunnan , china , in 2013 13 .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	they share about 96 % nucleotide sequence identities , suggesting that sars - cov-2 might have emerged from a bat sl - cov.

c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	depending on the virus , either ntd or cdomain can serve as the receptor - binding domain ( rbd ) .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	while rbd of mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) is located at the ntd 14 , most of other covs , including sars - cov and mers - cov use c - domain to bind their receptors [ 15 ]

c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	while s proteins of sars - cov-2 share about 76 % and 97 % of amino acid identities with sars - cov and ratg13 , respectively , the amino acid sequence of potential rbd of sars - cov-2 is only about 74 % and 90.1 % homologous to that of respectively .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	recently , zhou et al . 13 reported that sars - cov-2 uses hace2 as the receptor .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	cov s proteins are typical class i viral fusion proteins , and protease cleavage is required for activation of the fusion potential of s protein 23 .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	a two - step sequential protease cleavage model has been proposed for activation of s proteins of sars - cov and mers - cov 24,25 , priming cleavage between s1 and s2 and activating cleavage on s2 ' site .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	depending on virus strains and cell types , cov s proteins may be cleaved by one or several host proteases , including furin , trypsin , cathepsins , transmembrane protease serine protease-2 ( tmprss-2 ) , tmprss-4 , or human airway
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	however , whether any of these proteases could promote virus entry of sars - cov-2 remains elusive .
c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	in this study , using a lentiviral pseudotype system , we determine cell type susceptibility , virus receptor , entry pathway , and protease priming for sars - cov-2 , and identify several potential drug targets for sars - cov-2 .

2cf9c120c360c2cfbafe7c855779e5270fa51509	hypothermia and alkalemia might also be associated with an abnormal elevation in pressure , although these factors are not sufficient by themselves 3,9 .
2cf9c120c360c2cfbafe7c855779e5270fa51509	however , whether intensification of anticoagulation can ameliorate an abnormal elevation in pressure is unclear because most patients have already received a large amount of unfractionated heparin 1,2,11,12 .

6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	mathematical models are often regarded as recent innovations in the description and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics , but simple mathematical expressions have been in use for projection of epidemic trajectories for more than a century .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	in the mid-19th century , dr. william farr made the observation that epidemic events rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern that can be approximated by a bell - shaped curve .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	he noticed that this time - evolution behavior could be captured by a single mathematical formula ( " farr 's law " ) that could be used for epidemic forecasting .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	we show here that the idea model follows farr 's law , and show that for intuitive assumptions , farr 's law can be derived from the idea model .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	moreover , we show that both mathematical approaches , farr 's law and the idea model , resemble solutions of a susceptible - infectious - removed ( sir ) compartmental differential - equation model in an asymptotic limit , where the changes of disease transmission respond to control measures , and not only to the depletion of susceptible individuals .

fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus ( sads - cov ) , a novel coronavirus , was first discovered in southern china in january 2017 and caused a large scale outbreak of fatal diarrheal disease in piglets .
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	here , we conducted a retrospective investigation of 236 samples from 45 swine farms with a clinical history of diarrheal disease to evaluate the emergence and the distribution of sads - cov in pigs in china .
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	meanwhile , we detected a prevalence of sads - cov ( 43.53 % ) , porcine deltacoronavirus ( 8.83 % ) , porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus ( pedv ) ( 78.25 % ) , rotavirus ( 21.77 % ) , and transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( 0 % ) , and we also found the co - infection of sads - cov and pedv occurred most frequently with the rate of 17.65 % .

e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	background and objectives chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine has recently been the subject of intense debate regarding its potential antiviral activity against sars - cov-2 , the etiologic agent of covid-19 .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	therefore , the objective of this study was to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients using mathematical modeling .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	to shed some light on this controversial topic , we simulated hydroxychloroquine - based interventions on virus / host cell dynamics using a basic system of previously published differential equations .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	mathematical modeling was implemented using python programming language v 3.7 .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	according to mathematical modeling , hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak and viral clearance if the drug is administered early enough ( i.e. , when the virus is still confined within the pharyngeal cavity ) .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	the effects of chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine may be fully explained only when also considering the capacity of this drug to increase the death rate of sars - cov-2-infected cells , in this case by enhancing the cell - mediated immune response .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	these considerations may not only be applied to chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine but may have more general implications for development of anti - covid-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies through an increased death rate of the infected cells .

6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	the etiology of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system remains unknown and likely involves a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggering factors .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	given that exposure to numerous infectious pathogens occurs during childhood , and that some viral infections can lead to neurodegeneration and demyelination , it is conceivable that some viruses may act as triggering factors in neuropathogenesis .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	we have previously shown that the prototype oc43 strain of the common cold - associated human respiratory coronavirus has the capacity to infect human neuronal and glial cells and does persist in human brains .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	moreover , it has neuroinvasive properties in susceptible balb / c mice , where it leads to a chronic encephalitis with accompanying disabilities .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	here , we show that mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein , reproducibly acquired during viral persistence in human neural cell cultures , led to a drastically modified virus - induced neuropathology in balb / c mice , characterized by flaccid paralysis and demyelination .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	even though infection by both mutated and wild - type viruses led to neuroinflammation , the modified neuropathogenesis induced by the mutated virus was associated with increased viral spread and significantly more cd4 + and cd8 + t - lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system , as well as significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin ( il)-6 and the chemokine ccl2 ( monocyte chemoattractant protein [ mcp]-1 ) .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	moreover , recombinant virus harboring the s glycoprotein mutations retained its neurotropism , productively infecting neurons .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	therefore , interaction of a human respiratory coronavirus with the central nervous system may modulate virus and host factors resulting in a modified neuropathogenesis in genetically susceptible individuals .

33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	tracer gas measurements showed that the examined ventilation rates ( 6 and 12 air changes per hour ) had only a small effect on the air volume exchange across the doorway with the hinged door .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	supply - exhaust flow rate differential reduced the door motion - induced air transfer significantly with both door types .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	the experiments showed that the passage induced substantial air volume transport through the doorway with both door types .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	however , overall , the sliding door performed better in all tested scenarios , because the door - opening motion itself generated relatively smaller air volume exchange across the doorway , and hence should be the preferred choice in the design of isolation rooms .

879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	contrary to other more stable mating strategies ( e.g. harems ) , swarming could hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the iberian species pipistrellus pygmaeus , p. kuhlii and nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter , males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females , due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	as a general trend across species , we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances for two of the three studied bat species ( p. pygmaeus and p.kuhlii ) .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	these results increase our knowledge about the transmission mechanisms of adenoviruses .

bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	a survey of providers demonstrated opportunities to increase awareness of institutional criteria for picu admissions of children with dka .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	we created an electronic health record ( ehr ) dot - phrase , prepopulated with these criteria , and placed a note in the ehr for all patients with dka as a reference for all providers .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	an ehr - based data report was created to monitor the disposition of dka patients and the use of the dot - phrase ( process measure ) .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	the primary outcome measure was the potentially avoidable picu admissions for patients with dka .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	the percentage of dka admissions classified as potentially avoidable picu stays decreased from 4.1 % to 0.5 % , with a concurrent decrease in the total percentage of picu admissions for dka from 19.1 % to 8.4 % .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	a novel ehr - based intervention increasing awareness and documentation of established pediatric dka management guidelines can be used to safely reduce picu admissions for dka without increasing the rate of endocrinology ward - to - intensive care unit transfers .

d513f15e32bef1b241085c514a4aa41923e0475b	we delve into how enchantment might be digitally articulated through mediated ( as opposed to brick and mortar ) consumption , paying attention to the cultural techniques and affordances of the platforms and spaces .
d513f15e32bef1b241085c514a4aa41923e0475b	through a series of case studies , we examine ways in which enchantment can occur in digitally mediated shopping environments .
d513f15e32bef1b241085c514a4aa41923e0475b	our case studies suggest that enchanted digital logistical channels extend the value - creating functions of traditional logistics by creating consumption circumstances that surprise and intrigue , that suggest perceived scarcity , and that use social media to approach consumers in multiple ways to procure enchantment .

197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	the left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at s1 / s2 boundary , which is uniquely identified in sars - cov-2 .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	in this study , we identified two variants from the first guangdong sars - cov-2 cell strain , with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site ( prrar ) and its flank sites .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	these data indicate ( 1 ) the deletion of qtqtn , at the flank of polybasic cleavage site , is likely benefit the sars - cov-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples ; ( 2 ) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585 - 23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	the mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes ( or reverse ) that led to such genomic changes in sars - cov-2 requires further work .

ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	the pulmonary vasculature is an anatomic compartment that is frequently overlooked in the histologic review of lung biopsy samples , other than those obtained specifically to assess pulmonary vascular disease .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	though often of a nonspecific nature , the histologic pattern of vascular remodeling may at times suggest its underlying pathogenesis and provide clues to the cause of pulmonary hypertension .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	disproportionately severe vascular pathology may further indicate alternate disease processes , such as congestive heart failure or thromboemboli , contributing to the patient 's overall respiratory condition .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	this chapter discusses pulmonary hypertension , which represents a final common pathway of pulmonary vascular disease .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	3 idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( i.e. , primary pulmonary hypertension ) serves as a model of vascular reconfiguration formerly designated as " plexogenic arteriopathy .

5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	the medicines act 1968 and its european successors demand that marketing authorizations ( " licences " ) are only issued if medicines fulfil three criteria - quality of manufacture , efficacy in the licensed indication , and reasonable safety .

06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	nine studies supported the use of personal measures relating to hand hygiene .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	ten studies supported administrative controls such as cohorting military training units to reduce contact between units ( 4 studies ) , providing adequate personal space to reduce crowding ( 5 ) , and cloth barriers between beds ( 1 ) ; and 14 studies supported the use of engineering controls such as increased indoor air dilution and ventilation ( 2 ) , dust suppression ( 4 ) , and air sterilization ( 8) .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	promoting hand hygiene and reducing crowding through the provision of adequate living space and cohorting of training units may offer benefits in respiratory disease control .

6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	we examined publically available time - series data of laboratory tests for sars - cov-2 viral infection , the causal agent for covid-19 , to try to explore , using a bayesian approach , about the sensitivity and specificity of the pcr - based diagnostic test .
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near - perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity ( prior and posterior largely overlapped ) .
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	however , bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced , if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60 - 70 % range .
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	the best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of covid-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves , a task for which the bayesian method we presented is well - suited .

504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	hence , we investigated the sars - cov-2 spike receptor - binding domain ( ncov - rbd ) that interacts with hace2 for viral attachment and entry .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	three strategies and bioinformatics approaches were employed to design potential ncov - rbd -hace2 interaction - blocking peptides that may restrict viral attachment and entry .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	firstly , the key residues interacting with ncov - rbd -hace2 are identified and hace2 sequence - based peptides are designed .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	second , peptides from five antibacterial peptide databases that block ncov - rbd are identified ; finally , a chimeric peptide design approach is used to design peptides that can bind to key ncov - rbd residues .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	the final peptides are selected based on their physiochemical properties , numbers and positions of key residues binding , binding energy , and antiviral properties .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	: we found that : ( i ) three amino acid stretches in hace2 interact with ncov - rbd ; ( ii )

6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	carbon tetrachloride ( ccl 4 ) was injected into mice 30 days after mhv infection , and serum was assayed for autoab and total igg 20 days later .
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	the association of mhv infection with the toxic effects of ccl 4 resulted in hypergammaglobulinaemia and the production of autoab to various liver and kidney proteins .
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	histological examination of liver samples showed tissue damages but without significant differences between the animals submitted to mhv + ccl 4 and controls , which were either infected by mhv without ccl 4 , or poisoned by ccl 4 in the absence of mhv infection .
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	those results show that liver injury after viral infection may lead to the spreading of the immune response and to an increase of serum igg , suggesting that the procedure used herein could simulate the onset of autoimmune hepatitis .

32095de948f289ba4bc40c730a5f2a90a5cb09b7	coronavirus disease 2019 is an ongoing global pandemic that has spread rapidly since december 2019 .
32095de948f289ba4bc40c730a5f2a90a5cb09b7	real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rrt - pcr ) and chest computed tomography ( ct ) imaging both play an important role in covid-19 diagnosis .
32095de948f289ba4bc40c730a5f2a90a5cb09b7	chest ct imaging offers the benefits of quick reporting , a low cost , and high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary infection .
32095de948f289ba4bc40c730a5f2a90a5cb09b7	recently , deep - learning - based computer vision methods have demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications , including x - rays , magnetic resonance imaging , and ct imaging .
32095de948f289ba4bc40c730a5f2a90a5cb09b7	however , training a deep - learning model requires large volumes of data , and medical staff faces a high risk when collecting covid-19 ct data due to the high infectivity of the disease .
32095de948f289ba4bc40c730a5f2a90a5cb09b7	in order to meet the data requirements for covid-19 ct imaging , we propose a ct image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network that can effectively generate high - quality and realistic covid-19 ct images for use in deep - learningbased medical imaging tasks .

c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199	/ h1n1 viruses was measured in 579 healthy adults at enrollment ( fall 2009 ) and after surveillance for illness ( spring 2010 ) .
c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199	subjects reporting with moderate to severe acute respiratory illness had illness and virus quantitation for 1 week ; evaluations for missed illnesses were conducted over holiday periods and at the spring 2010 visit .
c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199	after excluding 66 subjects who received ph1n1 vaccine , 513 remained .
c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199	seventy - seven had reported with moderate to severe illnesses ; 31 were infected with ph1n1 virus , and 30 with a rhinovirus .
c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199	determining etiology from clinical findings was not possible , but fever and prominent myalgias favored influenza and prominent rhinorrhea favored rhinovirus .
c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199	tests of fall and spring antibody indicated ph1n1 infection of 23 % had occurred , with the rate decreasing with increasing anti - ph1n1 antibody ; a similar pattern was seen for influenza - associated illness .
c141ade48d767c58e67f0d7ff63b6e93b5f58199	a reducing frequency of ph1n1 infections was also seen with increasing antibody to the recent seasonal a/ h1n1 virus ( a / brisbane/59/07 ) .

8e64233f3ce51851740af4bce0fbefdbde0b8194	then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed .
8e64233f3ce51851740af4bce0fbefdbde0b8194	it showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and igg level was rose earlier than igm. comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms .
8e64233f3ce51851740af4bce0fbefdbde0b8194	these results supported the combination of serologic testing and nat in routine covid-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity .
d8b904a850c774ca810965d324284246e45f9432	in this study , we performed a single - centred study of 307 sars - cov-2 infected patients .

25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	profiling , we previously found that 66 mature mirnas were differentially expressed ( 54 up - and 12 downregulated ) in mid - luteal eutopic endometrium from women with minimal / mild endometriosis as compared with normal endometrial tissues [ 15 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	specifically , mir-196a upregulated mek / erk signaling and mediated repressed pgr expression and decidualization of endometrial stromal cells ( escs ) from eutopic endometrium with endometriosis [ 15 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	likewise , upregulation of mir-194 - 3p in eutopic endometrium inhibited pgr expression and esc decidualization in endometriosis , which hinders fertility by repressing the levels of pgr and decidualization in the eutopic endometrium [ 16 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	we have also shown that mir23a and mirna23b are downregulated in endometriosis and they upregulate several unidentified genes required for steroidogenic factor 1 ( sf-1 ) expression in escs [ 17 ] .

ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	nuclear receptors ( nrs ) are closely associated with various major diseases such as cancer , diabetes , inflammatory disease , and osteoporosis .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	therefore , nrs have become a frequent target for drug development .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	during the process of developing drugs against these diseases by targeting nrs , we are often facing a problem : given a nr and chemical compound , can we identify whether they are really in interaction with each other in a cell ?
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	to address this problem , a predictor called " inr - drug " was developed .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	in the predictor , the drug compound concerned was formulated by a 256-d ( dimensional ) vector derived from its molecular fingerprint , and the nr by a 500-d vector formed by incorporating its sequential evolution information and physicochemical features into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition , and the prediction engine was operated by the svm ( support vector machine )
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	compared with the existing prediction methods in this area , inr - drug not only can yield a higher success rate , but is also featured by a user - friendly web - server established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/inr-drug/ , which is particularly useful for most experimental scientists to obtain their desired data in a timely manner .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	it is anticipated that the inr - drug server may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development , and that the current approach may be easily extended to study the interactions of drug with other targets as well .
fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	in this letter , we introduce a concept of the high contrast probe cleavage detection ( hcpcd ) mechanism , which makes use of the dramatic optical signal amplification caused by cleavage of large numbers of high - contrast nanoparticle labels instead of the adsorption of low - index biological molecules .
fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	we illustrate numerically the hcpcd detection mechanism with an example of a silicon ring resonator as an optical transducer with gold and silicon nanoparticles as highcontrast labels .
fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	furthermore , detection specificity and signal amplification can be achieved through the use of collateral nucleic acid cleavage caused by enzymes such as cas12a and cas13 after binding to a target dna / rna sequence .

572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	in addition to viral taxonomy , the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism , direct contact or respiratory transmission , and limited ( 0 < r 0 ï¿½ 1 ) human - to - human transmissibility .

80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	co - infection of the same cell was not required but this effect was dependent on the time , dose and duration of the infections , as well as pathogen viability , bacterial uptake and endosome acidification .
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	finally , we showed that type i interferons were primarily responsible for the priming of il-12p70 that was observed by infection with iav .
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	these results provide a probable mechanism for the elevated levels of particular cytokines observed in iav and sp co - infected cell cultures with implications for the pathogenic outcome observed during in vivo infection .

cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	although a previous report described detection of viral rna in donor plasma , these donors tested positive for sars - cov-2 in a respiratory specimen or developed fever shortly after donation , suggesting that the donation occurred early in the course of their infection ( 2 ) .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	to our knowledge , the persistence of sars - cov-2 rna in plasma from an eligible donor after recovery from illness has not yet been described .

cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	the donor had symptoms of upper respiratory infection in early march , including body aches and sore throat without fever .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	the donor did not seek medical attention and was not tested for sars - cov-2 at that time .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	after the donor was notified about the results , and 5 days after the donation date , rt - pcr assay of the donor 's nasopharyngeal swab specimen showed no sars - cov-2 rna .

543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	sars - coronavirus ( cov ) is a zoonotic agent derived from rhinolophid bats , in which a plethora of sars - related , conspecific viral lineages exist .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	whereas the variability of virulence among reservoir - borne viruses is unknown , it is generally assumed that the emergence of epidemic viruses from animal reservoirs requires human adaptation .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	to understand the influence of a viral factor in relation to interspecies spillover , we studied the papain - like protease ( plp ) of sars -
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	this key enzyme drives the early stages of infection as it cleaves the viral polyprotein , deubiquitinates viral and cellular proteins , and antagonizes the interferon ( ifn ) response .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	we identified a bat sars - cov plp , which shared 86 % amino acid identity with sars - cov plp , and used reverse genetics to insert it into the sars - cov genome .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	the resulting virus replicated like sars - cov in vero cells but was suppressed in ifn competent ma-104 ( 3.7-fold ) , calu-3 ( 2.6-fold ) and human airway epithelial cells ( 10.3fold ) .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	using ectopically - expressed plp variants as well as full sars - cov infectious clones chimerized for plp , we found that a protease - independent , anti - ifn function exists in sars - cov , but not in a sars - related , bat - borne virus .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	this plp - mediated anti - ifn difference was seen in primate , human as well as bat cells , thus independent of the host context .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	the results of this study revealed that coronavirus plp confers a variable virulence trait among members of the species sars - cov , and that a sars - cov lineage with virulent plps may have pre - existed in the reservoir before onset of the epidemic .

24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	during outbreaks of deadly emerging pathogens ( e.g. , ebola , mers - cov ) and bioterror threats ( e.g. , smallpox ) , actively monitoring potentially infected individuals aims to limit disease transmission and morbidity .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	guidance issued by cdc on active monitoring was a cornerstone of its response to the west africa ebola outbreak .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	we present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	we analyze data from new york city 's ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014 - 2016 .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	for monitored individuals , we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at " low ( but not zero ) risk " and " some or high risk " : 21 and 31 days , respectively .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	extending our analysis to smallpox and mers - cov , we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to ebola due to less variable incubation periods .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure - risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	since the earliest descriptions of cmv reactivation in immune competent hosts , there have now been more than 20 studies demonstrating reactivation in non - immunesuppressed patients during critical illness .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	abstract cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) reactivation in nonimmune - suppressed critically ill patients is an area of increasing interest .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	cmv reactivates in approximately one - third of latently infected nonimmune - suppressed hosts during critical illness ; however , its role as a pathogen in these patients remains unclear .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	cmv reactivation has been linked to bacterial sepsis and likely results from inflammation , transient immune compromise , and viral epigenetic changes .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	while cmv may improve immune response to some bacterial infections , other data suggest that cmv induces exaggerated responses to severe infections that may be harmful to latently infected hosts .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	these results also suggest that previous infection history may explain significant differences seen between human septic responses and murine models of sepsis .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	while critically ill human hosts clearly have worse outcomes associated with cmv reactivation , determining causality remains an area of investigation , with randomized control trials currently being performed .

327a206d906a71a562dffa0489a0a5d31d96219c	recent studies indicate that control of the host 's metabolic resources is a core host - pathogen interaction .
327a206d906a71a562dffa0489a0a5d31d96219c	viruses have evolved mechanisms to usurp the host 's metabolic resources , funneling them towards the production of virion components as well as the organization of specialized compartments for replication , maturation , and dissemination .
327a206d906a71a562dffa0489a0a5d31d96219c	the complex interplay between virus and host over metabolic control has only just begun to be deconvoluted .
327a206d906a71a562dffa0489a0a5d31d96219c	however , it is clear that virally induced metabolic reprogramming can substantially impact infectious outcomes , highlighting the promise of targeting these processes for antiviral therapeutic development .

a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	( armax ) model are used to estimate the effects of these diseases in each sars - and avian flu - infected country , while a dynamic panel model is adopted to estimate the overall impact on the region of these two diseases .
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	the empirical results from both approaches are consistent and indicate that the numbers of affected cases have a significant impact on sars - affected countries but not on avian flu - affected countries .
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	however , since the potential damage arising from the avian flu and subsequent pandemic influenza is much greater than that resulting from the sars , the need to take the necessary precautions in the event of an outbreak of avian flu and pandemic influenza warrants further attention and action .
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	therefore , the empirical findings of this study could add to the knowledge regarding the relationship between tourism and crisis management , especially in so far as the management of transmissible diseases is concerned .

c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	yet , to date , there has been a lack of suitable tools and rigorous approaches to identify biological targets and pharmacological agents that can modify epithelial composition to enable causal testing of disease - associated changes with novel therapeutic candidates .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	to empower the search for epithelia - modifying agents , we establish a first - of - its - kind high - throughput phenotypic organoid screen .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	this approach is enabled by employing a functional , cell - type specific , scalable assay on an organoid model designed to represent the physiological cues of in vivo paneth cell differentiation from adult intestinal stem cells .

0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	uncertainties remain concerning the pathophysiology , epidemiology , and potential therapeutics for covid-19 .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	among unsettled controversies is whether tobacco smoking increases or protects from severe covid-19 .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	several epidemiological studies reported reduced covid-19 hospitalizations among smokers , while other studies reported the opposite trend .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	some authors assumed that smokers have elevated airway expression of ace2 , the cell recognition site of the sars - cov-2 spike protein , but this suggestion remains unverified .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	we therefore performed data mining of two independent ncbi geo genome - wide rna expression files ( gse7894 and gse994 ) and report that in both data sets , current smokers and never smokers have , on average , closely similar bronchial epithelial cell mrna levels of ace2 , as well as tmprss2 , coding for a serine protease priming sars - cov-2 for cell entry , and adam17 , coding for a protease implicated in ace2 membrane shedding .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	in contrast , the expression levels of tmprss4 , coding for a protease that primes sars - cov-2 for cell entry similarly to tmprss2 , were elevated in bronchial epithelial cells from current smokers compared with never smokers , suggesting that higher bronchial tmprss4 levels in smokers might put them at higher sars - cov-2 infection risk .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	the effects of smoking on covid-19 severity need clarification with larger studies .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	additionally , the postulated protective effects of nicotine and nitric oxide , which may presumably reduce the risk of a " cytokine storm " in infected individuals , deserve assessment by controlled clinical trials .

5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	analysis results indicate that the replacement of nc with the carboxyl - terminal half of the sars - cov n resulted in the production of wild type ( wt)-level virus - like particles ( vlps ) with the density of a wt hiv-1 particle .
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	when co - expressed with sars - cov n , chimeras containing the n carboxyl - terminal half sequence efficiently packaged n.
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	however , the same was not true for the chimera bearing the n amino - terminal half sequence , despite its production of substantial amounts of vlps .
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	according to further analysis , hiv-1 nc replacement with n residues 2 - 213 , 215 - 421 , or 234 - 421 resulted in efficient vlp production at levels comparable to that of wt hiv-1 , but replacement with residues 215 - 359 , 302 - 421 , 2 - 168 , or 2 - 86 failed to restore vlp production to wildtype levels .
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	the results suggest that the domain conferring the ability to direct vlp assembly and release in sars - cov n is largely contained between residues 168 and 421 .

3380c2147c090bd81525c67d4200fb3860517008	the treated mice showed no clinical symptom of croup or systemic adverse reactions .
3380c2147c090bd81525c67d4200fb3860517008	the respiratory tract epithelium captured rhpiv2 effectively without remarkable cytotoxic effects .
3380c2147c090bd81525c67d4200fb3860517008	these results suggested that rhpiv2 / ag85b might be a potent therapeutic tool to control allergic disorders .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	the reasons for a wide variation in severity of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) across the affected countries of the world are not known .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	two recent studies have suggested a link between the bcg vaccination policy and the morbidity and mortality due to covid-19 .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	in the present study we compared the impact of covid-19 in terms of case fatality rates ( cfr ) between countries with high disease burden and those with bcg revaccination policies presuming that revaccination practices would have provided added protection to the population against severe covid-19 .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	we found a significant difference in the cfr between the two groups of countries .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	our data further supports the view that universal bcg vaccination has a protective effect on the course of covid-19 probably preventing progression to severe disease and death .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	clinical trials of bcg vaccine are urgently needed to establish its beneficial role in covid-19 as suggested by the epidemiological data , especially in countries without a universal bcg vaccination policy .
eb7ed9704b8aca731653e08d7a790c84f4352f37	these discoveries open new avenues for investigating the fundamental mechanisms of pathogen infection and the development of new therapeutics .
0f39912b9c07de80bf4041710227ca5990899db8	in order to establish optimization of different parameters of chemical transformation , that is the reaction pathway for each step and reaction conditions in the each step , in the present paper , different solvents and catalysts were used .
0f39912b9c07de80bf4041710227ca5990899db8	the structures of the synthesized compounds were assigned on the basis of elemental analysis , ir , 1 h nmr and 13 c nmr spectral data .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	the emergence of the highly pathogenic sars coronavirus ( sars - cov ) has reignited interest in coronavirus biology and pathogenesis .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	an emerging theme in coronavirus pathogenesis is that the interaction between specific viral genes and the host immune system , specifically the innate immune system , functions as a key determinant in regulating virulence and disease outcomes .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	using sars - cov as a model , we will review the current knowledge of the interplay between coronavirus infection and the host innate immune system in vivo , and then discuss the mechanisms by which specific gene products antagonize the host innate immune response in cell culture models .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	our data suggests that the sars - cov uses specific strategies to evade and antagonize the sensing and signaling arms of the interferon pathway .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	we summarize by identifying future points of consideration that will contribute greatly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing coronavirus pathogenesis and virulence , and the development of severe disease in humans and animals .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is a novel coronavirus strain disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	( sars - cov-2 ) .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	the disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16 % of hospitalized cases .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	the admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of covid-19 include severe hypoxia , low platelet count , elevated bilirubin , hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	these symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	the diseases also share similar comorbidity risks including dementia , type 2 diabetes mellitus , coronary heart disease , hypertension and chronic renal failure .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	sepsis has been observed in up to 59 % of hospitalized covid-19 patients .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	it is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy / drug repurposing avenues for late - stage severe covid-19 patients .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	this would enable better protection of at - risk populations and clinical stratification of covid-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	as there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed covid-19 patients correlating their genomic profile , disease severity and outcome , co - morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors ( such as ethnicity , blood group , smoking , bmi etc . ) , a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	we therefore ran a study on the uk biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes , and correlated these with covid-19 patients .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	sepsis is itself a life - threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20 % .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	like the initial studies for covid-19 patients , standard genome wide association studies ( gwas ) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	we used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from uk biobank .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	we identified 70 sepsis risk - associated genes , which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	this study has identified 70 sepsis related genes , many of them for the first time , that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe covid-19 patients .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	we have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe covid-19 .
1ee530e6cf6878b8453f003e7e6c099e34469ad5	background - recently , several new human coronaviruses have been identified .
1ee530e6cf6878b8453f003e7e6c099e34469ad5	i human coronaviruses was developed and was used to screen serum from 243 children and young adults .
1ee530e6cf6878b8453f003e7e6c099e34469ad5	conclusions - infection with these viruses is common in childhood though the prevalence of these viruses may vary from year to year .

41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	recent epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of hand , foot , and mouth disease ( hfmd ) , which can be categorized according to its clinical symptoms as typical or atypical , have markedly increased worldwide .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	a primary causative agent for typical hfmd outbreaks , enterovirus 71
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	( ev71 ) , has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in s phase for own replication ; however , it is not clear whether coxsackievirus ( cva6 ) , the main agent for atypical hfmd , also regulates the host cell cycle .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	in line with its role to arrest cells in g0 / g1 phase , the expression of cyclind1 , cdk4 , cycline1 , cdk2 , cyclinb1 , cdk1 , p53 , p21 , and p16 is regulated by cva6 .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	finally , the non - structural proteins of cva6 , rna - dependent rna polymerase 3d and protease 3c , are demonstrated to be responsible for the g0 / g1-phase arrest .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	these findings suggest that cva6 infection arrested cell cycle in g0 / g1-phase via non - structural proteins 3d and 3c , which may provide favorable environments for virus production .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	the 3c - like main peptidase 3cl pro is a viral polyprotein processing enzyme essential for the viability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	while it is generalized that 3cl pro and the structurally related 3c pro viral peptidases cleave their substrates via a mechanism similar to that underlying the peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin - like serine proteinases ( clsps ) , some of the hypothesized key intermediates have not been structurally characterized .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	here , we present three crystal structures of sars 3cl pro in complex with each of two members of a new class of peptide - based phthalhydrazide inhibitors .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	both inhibitors form an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of cys145 , trapping the enzyme 's catalytic residues in configurations similar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis of native substrates .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	most significantly , our crystallographic data are consistent with a scenario in which a water molecule , possibly via indirect coordination from the carbonyl oxygen of thr26 , has initiated nucleophilic attack on the enzyme - bound inhibitor .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	a large percentage of the deaths from covid-19 occur among residents of long - term care facilities .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	our findings show that , controlling for the population density , the percentage of older adults in the population , and the number of hospital beds per capita , there is a significant positive association between the number of long - term care beds ( ltcb ) per capita and covid-19 mortality rates .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	this finding provides support for the claim that long - term care living arrangements ( of older people ) are a significant risk factor for dying from covid-19 .
797d4bc91a5889c5fbcd4a51cbd1459fe277fe58	intracranial inoculation of immunocompetent mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( lcmv ) induces a fatal neurologic illness .
797d4bc91a5889c5fbcd4a51cbd1459fe277fe58	in this disease a marked increase in mhc class i expression was found , closely associated with viral antigens and inflammatory infiltrates , in meninges , choroid plexus and ventricular ependyma but not within the brain parenchyma .
797d4bc91a5889c5fbcd4a51cbd1459fe277fe58	mice inoculated at birth had persistent infections , with lcmv antigens found primarily in neurons , but no inflammatory cells or focal increase in mhc class i. failure of infected neurons to express mhc class i allows them to escape destruction by cytotoxic t cells ( ctl ) but may increase their susceptibility to be persistently infected by non - lytic viruses .
d6bbcc059331dda0ac8c4a897f4d7171d0d1cb99	while anxiety / fear and depression with respiratory symptoms were frequently observed in victims and family members , chronic psychological distress such as alcohol / smoking abuse and insomnia was relatively high in bereaved family members .
d6bbcc059331dda0ac8c4a897f4d7171d0d1cb99	in conclusion , it is important to provide mental health support for victims and their families , focusing on the characteristic symptoms of each group as well as monetary compensation .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	in this manuscript we propose a method for pricing insurance products that cover not only traditional risks , but also unforeseen ones .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	under a bayesian set - up , we show that when working with a finite mixture of conjugate priors , the premium can be estimated by a mixture of posterior means , with updated parameters , depending on claim histories .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	the effect of anaesthetic gases given via laryngeal mask on nasal ciliary beat pattern and frequency has not been studied .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	anaesthetic gases such as isoÂ¯urane , halothane and enÂ¯urane are known to reduce ciliary beat frequency , but it is unknown whether they also cause cilia to beat in a dyskinetic fashion .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	protein ubiquitination is a highly conserved post - translational modification affecting various biological processes including viral propagation .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	this involves the covalent attachment of the highly conserved 76 amino acid residue ubiquitin protein to target proteins by the consecutive actions of e1 , e2 and e3 enzymes , and the 26s proteasome that together form a multiprotein complex that degrades target proteins .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	to combat this host anti - viral machinery , viruses have evolved the ability to employ or subvert the ups to inactivate or degrade cellular proteins to favour viral propagation .

107f0d5a47f48f85d6645cac0e7008edc4d9d8cd	here , we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two puerto rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses .
107f0d5a47f48f85d6645cac0e7008edc4d9d8cd	using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm , we categorized herpesviruses into 41 otus , representing approximately 80 % of all herpesviruses in the host community .

9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	a truncated cd200 ( cd200 tr ) resulting from alternative splicing has been identified and characterized as a functional antagonist to full - length cd200 .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	in this study , we identified an exonic splicing enhancer ( ese ) located in exon 2 , which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein sf2/ asf .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	direct binding of sf2 / asf to the ese site was confirmed by rna electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	knockdown of expression of sf2 / asf resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ese , whereas overexpression of sf2 / asf increased expression of the full - length cd200 .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	in vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of cd200 with increased expression of sf2 / asf and the full - length cd200 .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	taken together , our data suggest for the first time that sf2 / asf regulates the function of cd200 by controlling cd200 alternative splicing , through direct binding to an ese located in exon 2 of cd200 .

354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	covid-19 is an extremely infectious disease with a relatively large virus incubation period in the affected people who may be asymptomatic .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	it is shown that an early lockdown in late march 2020 changed the initial exponential growth curve of covid-19 to a linear one , but a surge in the number of cases from late april 2020 brought india back to a quadratic trajectory .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	it is further shown that the number of reported infections correlates with the number of tests , and therefore regions with limited diagnostics resources may not have a realistic estimate of the virus spread .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	in the absence of a reliable estimate of the true number of infections , these projections will have a limited accuracy : with that limitation , the most optimistic prediction suggests a continuing virus transmission through september 2020 .

aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	microbiome - host interactions play significant roles in health and in various diseases including autoimmune disorders .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	uncovering these inter - kingdom cross - talks propels our understanding of disease pathogenesis and provides useful leads on potential therapeutic targets .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	despite the biological significance of microbe - host interactions , there is a big gap in understanding the downstream effects of these interactions on host processes .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	using the concept of network diffusion , microbiolink can analyse how microbial proteins in a certain context are influencing cellular processes by modulating gene or protein expression .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	we used gut metaproteomic data from crohn 's disease patients and healthy controls to uncover the mechanisms by which the microbial proteins can modulate host genes which belong to biological processes implicated in disease pathogenesis .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	most of the inferences between microbial composition changes and disease phenotypes have been based on associations and correlations , with little explanations of the mechanisms driving the phenotypes .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	studying microbiome - host interactions and its influence on host biological mechanisms is important for monitoring health and disease and for discovering / fine - tuning therapeutic interventions .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	for example , bacterial molecules such as metabolites [ 8 ] , proteins [ 9 - 12 ] , and small rnas [ 13 ] can interact with host molecules and , through host intracellular pathways and regulatory networks , can modulate the expression of genes in various biological processes [ 14 ]
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	besides the metabolite - mediated interactions , protein - protein interactions ( ppis ) are one of the most relevant types of molecular interplay between microbes and host organisms [ 12 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	ppis are time consuming and have limitations imposed by cost [ 1 , [ 17 ]
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	hence , there is a dearth of validated interspecies ppis in publicly available databases , and these are mostly limited to pathogens .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	however , using predicted microbe - host ppis , it is possible to build interaction networks to better understand the cross - talk between the microbial and host proteins and how these interactions interfere with host metabolism and physiology [ 22 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	recent studies have also shown how protein - protein interactions between emerging pathogens such as covid-19 and the host have enabled the discovery of potential drug candidates for clinical testing and validation [ 23 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	most of these resources store ppis and/or genomic analysis of virulence but are limited to pathogens [ 22 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	moreover , most of the existing resources and pipelines are confined to predicting the direct molecular interactions at the microbe - host interface and do not infer the downstream effects on functional processes and host signalling pathways .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	in order to demonstrate the applicability of microbiolink , we performed a case study investigating how the gut microbiome potentially modulates autophagy genes in crohn 's disease ( cd ) .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	by providing custom - made lists of microbial proteins , host receptor proteins , molecular interaction networks , and the target node sets , users can harness the functionalities of microbiolink to understand the mechanisms which mediate the influence of microbial proteins derived from the individual microbes or the microbiome .

87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	to understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance , we applied rna sequencing ( rna - seq ) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. hep - flury or cvs-11 intranasally inoculated mice .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	it is found that hep - flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the rig - i / mda-5 signaling , and the innate immunity pre - activated by hep - flury or newcastle disease virus ( ndv ) infection can effectively prevent the cvs-11 to invade central nervous system ( cns ) , but fails to clear the cvs-11 after its entry into the cns .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	in addition , following cvs-11 infection , genes implicated in cell adhesion , blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up - regulated , while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down - regulated .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	on the other hand , several genes involved in the mhc class ii - mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the hep - flury infection as compared with the cvs-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of cd4 + t cells and mhc class ii - mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated rabv from the cns .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	the differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post - exposure treatment window for rabv infection .

97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5	in this work , we used gene expression and virus growth data from influenza - infected mice to determine how moderate and deadly influenza viruses may invoke unique inflammatory responses and the role these responses play in disease pathology .
97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5	we found that the relationship between virus growth and the inflammatory response for all viruses tested can be characterized by ultrasensitive response in which the inflammatory response is gated until a threshold concentration of virus is exceeded in the lung after which strong inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production occurs .
97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5	this finding challenges the notion that deadly influenza viruses invoke unique cytokine and inflammatory responses and provides additional evidence that pathology is regulated by virus load , albeit in a highly nonlinear fashion .

89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	these include direct defensin targeting of viral envelopes , glycoproteins , and capsids in addition to inhibition of viral fusion and post - entry neutralization .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	binding and modulation of host cell surface receptors and disruption of intracellular signaling by defensins can also inhibit viral replication .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	in addition , defensins can function as chemokines to augment and alter adaptive immune responses , revealing an indirect antiviral mechanism .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	nonetheless , many questions regarding the antiviral activities of defensins remain .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	importantly , the role of defensin antiviral activity in vivo has not been addressed due to the lack of a complete defensin knockout model .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	overall , the antiviral activity of defensins is well established as are the variety of mechanisms by which defensins achieve this inhibition ; however , additional research is needed to fully understand the role of defensins in viral pathogenesis .

89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	hd5 and hd6 are expressed by specialized epithelial paneth cells of the small intestine 20 ; 21 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	( hbds ) are more widely expressed by epithelial cells in skin and at mucosal surfaces in contact with the environment 26 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	although there are commonalities in expression patterns of defensins in humans and other species , one important difference relevant for experimental models of infectious disease is that mice lack myeloiddefensins 29 ; 30 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	quantification of physiologic defensin concentrations in vivo is complex , as defensins are present at high local concentrations within specific cell types or upon release from cells into confined anatomical niches ( e.g. , crypts of the small intestine ) but can become diluted in extracellular fluids .

8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	moreover , fusion analysis with a dual - labeled influenza virus revealed a significant reduction in fusion events , with no detectable impact on endosomal ph , suggesting that ctsw is required at the stage of viral fusion .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	the defect in iav entry upon ctsw knockdown could be rescued by ectopic expression of wild - type ctsw but not by the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of ctsw , suggesting that the proteolytic activity of ctsw is required for successful entry of iav .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	however , we have only limited knowledge on how these factors support virus replication , which would be required for drug development .
