4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	( usp18 ) encodes a protein that negatively regulates t1 ifn signaling via stearic inhibition of jak1 recruitment to the ifn - receptor 2 subunit ( ifnar2 ) .
4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	here , we demonstrate that usp18 expression is induced by hiv-1 in a t1 ifn - dependent manner .

4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	( cas9 ) gene editing results in a significant restriction of hiv-1 replication in an induced pluripotent stem cell ( ipsc)-derived macrophage model .
4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	in the absence of usp18 , macrophages have increased responsiveness to stimulation with t1 ifns with prolonged phosphorylation of stat1 and stat2 and increased expression of ifn - stimulated genes that are key for antiviral responses .
4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	interestingly , hiv-1 requires some signaling through the t1 ifn receptor to replicate efficiently because a neutralizing antibody that inhibits t1 ifn activity reduces hiv-1 replication rate in monocyte - derived macrophages .
4fb5e7fb5d3ec9366bfa98bb436d3b34dc4755fb	usp18 induction by hiv-1 tunes the ifn response to optimal levels allowing for efficient transcription from the hiv-1 ltr promoter while minimizing the t1 ifn - induced antiviral response that would otherwise restrict viral replication and spread .

01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	coronaviruses ( cov ) are positive - sense rna viruses that infect numerous mammalian and avian 23 species and are capable of causing severe and lethal disease in humans .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	covs encode several 24 innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate 25 efficient viral replication .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	cov non - structural protein 14 ( nsp14 ) encodes 3'-to-5 ' 26 exoribonuclease activity ( exon ) , which performs a proofreading function and is required for 27 high - fidelity replication .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	outside of the order nidovirales , arenaviruses are the only rna viruses 28
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	that encode an exon , which functions to degrade dsrna
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	replication intermediates .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	in this study , 29 we tested the hypothesis that cov exon may also function to antagonize the innate immune 30 response .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	we demonstrate that viruses lacking exon activity [ exon(- ) ] are sensitive to cellular 31 pretreatment with interferon beta ( ifn - β ) in a dose - dependent manner .

01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	virus replication 34 did not result in ifn - β gene expression , and in the presence of an ifn - β - mediated antiviral state , 35 exon(- ) viral rna levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	however , exon(-36 ) virus generated from ifn - β pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased 37 relative fitness , suggesting that exon(- ) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to 38 establish a subsequent infection .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	overall , our data suggest mhv exon activity is required for 39 resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral rna 40 sequence and/or an rna modification act on viruses lacking exon activity .

01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	additionally , no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines currently exist for human cov 46 infections .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	therefore , the study of cov innate immune antagonists is essential for understanding 47
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	how covs overcome host defenses and to maximize potential therapeutic interventions .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	here , we 48 sought to determine the contributions of nsp14 exon activity in the induction of and resistance 49 to the innate immune response .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	we show that viruses lacking nsp14-exon activity are more 50 sensitive to restriction by exogenous ifn - β and that viruses produced in the presence of an 51 antiviral state are less capable of establishing a subsequent viral infection .
01e4038e4666baad3a769c5722122bab9aaa2741	our results support the 52 hypothesis that mhv exon activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response .

646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	we expressed the antiviral lectin griffithsin ( grft ) , which shows potent neutralizing activity against hiv , in the endosperm of transgenic rice plants ( oryza sativa ) , to determine whether rice can be used to produce inexpensive grft as a microbicide ingredient .

646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	os grft bound to hiv glycans with similar efficiency to grft produced in escherichia coli .
646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	wholecell assays using purified os grft and infectivity assays using crude extracts of transgenic rice endosperm confirmed that both crude and pure os grft showed potent activity against hiv and the crude extracts were not toxic towards human cell lines , suggesting they could be administered as a microbicide with only minimal processing .
646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	a freedom - to - operate analysis confirmed that grft produced in rice is suitable for commercial development , and an economic evaluation suggested that 1.8 kg / ha of pure grft could be produced from rice seeds .
646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39	our data therefore indicate that rice could be developed as an inexpensive production platform for grft as a microbicide component .

f617fbea70da0b41aa8d3e701acf12bd03fcd901	while preliminary choices were essentially based on in vitro potency , clinical translation into effective therapies may be challenging due to unfavorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties at the doses chosen for this new indication of covid-19 infection .
f617fbea70da0b41aa8d3e701acf12bd03fcd901	however , available pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic - pharmacodynamic studies suffer from severe limitations leading to unreliable conclusions , especially in term of dosing optimization .
f617fbea70da0b41aa8d3e701acf12bd03fcd901	in this paper we propose to highlight these limitations and to identify some of the major requirements that need to be addressed in designing pk and pk - pd studies in this era of covid .
f617fbea70da0b41aa8d3e701acf12bd03fcd901	a special attention should be paid to pre - analytical and analytical requirements and to the proper collection of covariates affecting dose - exposure relationships ( co - medications , use of specific organ support techniques and other clinical and para - clinical data ) .
f617fbea70da0b41aa8d3e701acf12bd03fcd901	we also promote the development of population pk and pk - pd models specifically dedicated to covid-19 patients since those previously developed for other diseases ( sel , malaria , hiv ) and clinical situations ( steadystate , non - icu patients ) are not representative of severe patients .
f617fbea70da0b41aa8d3e701acf12bd03fcd901	therefore , implementation of well - designed pk and pd studies targeted to covid-19 patients is urgently needed .
f617fbea70da0b41aa8d3e701acf12bd03fcd901	for that purpose we call for multi - institutional collaborative work and involvement of clinical pharmacologists in multidisciplinary research consortia .

551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	the study employed a cross - sectional research design .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	observations were made using a 16-item checklist , based on three sources : centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , world health organization ( who ) , and boyce and pittet 's guidelines of hand hygiene .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	the checklist was used for both direct - observation and self - reported data collection purposes .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	pearson correlation and multivariate analysis of covariance ( mancova ) were utilized to statistically determine the relationship between healthcare workers ' reports of hand hygiene practices and observed hand hygiene behaviors .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	the study was conducted in the outpatient examination rooms and emergency departments of three types of hospitals in the eastern region of saudi arabia where middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) is endemic and is observed in routine cases and outbreaks .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	the total sample size included 87 physicians and nurses recruited while on duty during the scheduled observation periods , with each healthcare worker being observed during individual medical examinations with at least three patients .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	no statistically significant correlations between the healthcare workers ' perceptions of hand hygiene practices and healthcare workers ' actual behaviors were evident .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	based on the self - report questionnaires , significant differences were found between physicians ' and nurses ' hand hygiene practices reports .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	healthcare workers clearly understand the importance of careful hand hygiene practices , but based on researchers ' observations , the medical personnel failed to properly implement protocol - driven hand hygiene applications .
551c5105a50ea1d7d52d13424441d1788f67bc91	however , the significant differences between physicians ' and nurses ' self - reports suggest further inquiry is needed to fully explore these discrepancies .
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	the coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic has led many countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the outbreak .
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough , and whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public discourse .

a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	to this end , this paper develops a bayesian model for predicting the effects of covid-19 lockdown policies in a global context -we treat each country as a distinct data point , and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country - specific policy effects .
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	our model utilizes a two - layer gaussian process ( gp )
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	prior -the lower layer uses a compartmental seir ( susceptible , exposed , infected , recovered ) model as a prior mean function with " country - andpolicy - specific " parameters that capture fatality curves under " counterfactual " policies within each country , whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries , and learns lower - layer seir parameters as a function of a country 's features and its policy indicators .
a49de5f1a944f632fc6dc1e49fae3118769f3272	our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of seir models ( bayesian priors ) with the flexible data - driven modeling and gradient - based optimization routines of machine learning ( bayesian posteriors )

0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	the covid-19 pandemic has reduced radiology volumes across the country as providers have decreased elective care in order to minimize the spread of infection and free up health care delivery system capacity .
0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	following the stay - at - home order in our county , imaging volumes at our institution decreased to approximately 46 % of baseline volumes , similar to the experience of other radiology practices .
0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	given the substantial differences in severity and timing of the disease in different geographic regions , estimating resumption of radiology volumes will be one of the next major challenges for radiology practices .
0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	we hypothesize that there are 6 major variables that will likely predict radiology volumes : ( 1 ) severity of disease in the local region , including potential subsequent " waves " of infection , ( 2 ) lifting of government social distancing restrictions , ( 3 ) patient concern regarding risk of leaving home and entering imaging facilities , ( 4 ) management of pent up demand for imaging delayed during the acute phase of the pandemic , including institutional capacity , ( 5 ) impact of the economic downturn on health insurance and ability to pay for imaging , and ( 6 ) radiology practice profile reflecting amount of elective imaging performed , including type of patients seen by the radiology practice such as emergency / inpatient / outpatient mix and sub - specialty types .
0732b49a59dc59145d944510ebe2b760c0303279	we encourage radiology practice leaders to use these and other relevant variables to plan for the coming weeks and to work collaboratively with local health system and governmental leaders to help ensure that needed patient care is restored as quickly as the environment will safely permit .

683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	samples were screened by nested pcr using two sets of primers conserved between wuv and kipyv , as well for other respiratory viruses ( respiratory syncytial virus [ rsv ] , adenoviruses [ adv ] , influenza a / b and parainfluenza viruses 1 - 3 , human bocavirus , b19 ) .
683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	results and conclusions :
683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	wuv and kipyv were detected in 10 and 14 samples , respectively from 983 specimens ( from 9 to 10 different individuals from 612 study subjects ) .
683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	infections occurred in two types of study subject ; those who were young ( < 2 years ) with lower respiratory tract infections ( n = 8) , and almost invariably co - infected with other respiratory viruses ( rsv , adv ) , and a second , generally older group either without respiratory disease ( n = 6 ) or with mild upper respiratory tract infections ( n = 5 ) but who were generally clinically severely immunosuppressed from leukaemia or transplant therapy .
683e3d8868d1e24591c9966215168869de4bf793	findings from either group do not support an aetiological link between infection with wuv or kipyv and respiratory disease .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	background :
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	rabbits are cecotrophic , hindgut - fermenters that rely heavily on their gastrointestinal microbiota for optimal digestion of plant - based diets .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	dysbiosis , caused by disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota , is known to predispose rabbits to rabbit enteritis complex ( rec ) , a major cause of morbidity and mortality .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	the objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings ( commercial meat , companion , laboratory , and shelter ) and to identify how factors such as age , season , and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	results :
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	a total of 86 pooled commercial meat , 54 companion , 14 pooled laboratory , and 14 shelter rabbit fecal samples were evaluated using 16s rrna gene sequencing of the v4 region .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	in all sample types , the predominant bacterial phylum was firmicutes .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	other commonly identified phyla ( composing ≥ 1 % of the total microbiota composition ) were verrucomicrobia , proteobacteria , and bacteroidetes .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	significant differences in composition were noted between commercial , companion , laboratory , and shelter rabbit samples for proportions of verrucomicrobia ( p < 0.01 ) , proteobacteria ( p < 0.01 ) , and lentisphaerae ( p = 0.01 ) within the total microbiota .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	within the commercial meat rabbit samples , significant differences between the microbiota composition of growers
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	( n = 42 )
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	and does ( n = 44 )
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	were limited to one unclassified firmicutes ( p = 0.03 ) and no differences were identified at the phylum level .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	significant differences were present between fecal samples taken from rabbits during the summer ( n = 44 ) compared to the winter ( n = 42 ) , with firmicutes ( p = 0.04 ) , verrucomicrobia ( p = 0.03 ) , proteobacteria ( p = 0.02 ) , deinococcus - thermus ( p = 0.04 ) , armatimonadates ( p = 0.003 ) , and actinobacteria ( p = 0.03 ) forming significantly different proportions of the microbiota .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	the only significant difference in composition between those farms that routinely reported antimicrobial use and those that did not was in one unclassified bacteroidetes ( p < 0.05 ) and no differences were identified at the phylum level .
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	conclusions :
03b35e72b8abfe6c88da27e72b5ecc8e77211dd2	rabbit husbandry and diet , in addition to season , significantly influence the fecal microbiota composition of domestic rabbits , while age of the rabbit post - weaning has minimal impact .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	despite causing pandemics and yearly epidemics that result in significant morbidity and mortality , our arsenal of options to treat influenza a virus ( iav ) infections remains limited and is challenged by the virus itself .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	while vaccination is the preferred intervention strategy against influenza , its efficacy is reduced in the elderly and infants who are most susceptible to severe and/or fatal infections .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	in addition , antigenic variation of iav complicates the production of efficacious vaccines .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	similarly , effectiveness of currently used antiviral drugs is jeopardized by the development of resistance to these drugs .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	like many viruses , iav is reliant on host factors and signaling - pathways for its replication , which could potentially offer alternative options to treat infections .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	while host - factors have long been recognized as attractive therapeutic candidates against other viruses , only recently they have been targeted for development as iav antivirals .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	future strategies to combat iav infections will most likely include approaches that alter host - virus interactions on the one hand or dampen harmful host immune responses on the other , with the use of biological response modifiers ( brms ) .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	in principle , brms are biologically active agents including antibodies , small peptides , and/or other ( small ) molecules that can influence the immune response .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	brms are already being used in the clinic to treat malignancies and autoimmune diseases .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	repurposing such agents would allow for accelerated use against severe and potentially fatal iav infections .
dc8b895c70dc5612cbe0efd328ca21624736c932	in this review , we will address the potential therapeutic use of different brm classes to modulate the immune response induced after iav infections .

41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	male sprague - dawley ( sd ) rats were randomly divided into the ccl 4 group which received intraperitoneal injection of 40 % ccl 4 dissolved in olive oil every three days for four consecutive weeks
41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	( initial dose was 5 ml / kg , other dose : 3 ml / kg ) and the control group which received the same dose of olive oil .
41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	the micro - structure of the liver was examined by h&e. hepatic ang ii and ang(1 - 7 ) was detected .
41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	realtime pcr and western - blot were performed to determine the gene and protein expression of the ras .
41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	the components of ras were all up - regulated in ccl 4 group , and the increased extent of ace - ang ii - at1 axis was higher than the ace2-ang(1 - 7)-mas
41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	axis .
41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	there was a significant correlation between ace and ace2 gene expression , at1 and mas gene expression , ang ii and ang(1 - 7 ) in the liver of rats .
41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	ace ( or ace2 ) gene expression strongly correlated with the index of liver injury significantly .
41b73d879ee3a77186662ef05b392750923ac5fb	these results suggest hepatic fibrogenesis induced by chronic ccl 4 administration may be associated with the relationship of ace - ang ii - at1 axis and ace2-ang(1 - 7)-mas axis .

d4b50ef79735dfe99adea35bf7fa89ea18703a3e	two bv formulae can thus be translated into two lia formulae and then an interpolation engine for lia used to derive an interpolant , albeit one expressed in lia .
d4b50ef79735dfe99adea35bf7fa89ea18703a3e	the construction is completed by back - translating the lia interpolant into a bv formula whose models coincide with those of the lia interpolant .
d4b50ef79735dfe99adea35bf7fa89ea18703a3e	this paper develops a back - translation algorithm showing , for the first time , how back - translation can be universally applied , whatever the lia interpolant .
d4b50ef79735dfe99adea35bf7fa89ea18703a3e	this avoids the need for deriving a bv interpolant by bit - blasting the bv formulae , as a backup process when back - translation fails .
d4b50ef79735dfe99adea35bf7fa89ea18703a3e	the new back - translation process relies on a novel geometric technique , called gapping , the correctness and practicality of which are demonstrated .

82ddfda23359b76b14cd3fce9119dc315d258819	ubiquitin mediated signaling contributes critically to host cell defenses during pathogen infection .
82ddfda23359b76b14cd3fce9119dc315d258819	many pathogens manipulate the ubiquitin system to evade these defenses .
82ddfda23359b76b14cd3fce9119dc315d258819	here we characterize a likely effector protein bearing a deubiquitylase ( dub ) domain from the obligate intracellular bacterium orientia tsutsugamushi , the causative agent of scrub typhus .
82ddfda23359b76b14cd3fce9119dc315d258819	the ulp1like dub prefers ubiquitin substrates over ubiquitin - like proteins and efficiently cleaves polyubiquitin chains of three or more ubiquitins .
82ddfda23359b76b14cd3fce9119dc315d258819	the co - crystal structure of the dub ( otdub ) domain with ubiquitin revealed three bound ubiquitins : one engages the s1 site ,
82ddfda23359b76b14cd3fce9119dc315d258819	the second binds an s2 site contributing to chain specificity and the third binds a unique ubiquitin - binding domain ( ubd ) .
82ddfda23359b76b14cd3fce9119dc315d258819	the ubd modulates otdub activity , undergoes a pronounced structural transition upon binding ubiquitin , and binds monoubiquitin with an unprecedented~5 nm dissociation constant .

330a49685a269070206fdd0f4bba345e96bf492f	viruses are completely dependent on their host cells for the successful production of progeny viruses .
330a49685a269070206fdd0f4bba345e96bf492f	at each stage of the viral life cycle an intricate interplay between virus and host takes place with the virus aiming to usurp the host cell for its purposes and the host cell trying to block the intruder from propagation .
330a49685a269070206fdd0f4bba345e96bf492f	in recent years these interactions have been studied on a global level by systems biology approaches , such as rna interference screens , transcriptomic or proteomic methodologies , and exciting new insights into the pathogenhost relationship have been revealed .

0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	the significance of the integral membrane protein niemann - pick c1 ( npc1 ) in the ebolavirus entry process has been determined using various cell lines derived from humans , nonhuman primates and fruit bats .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	fruit bats have long been purported as the potential reservoir host for ebolaviruses , however several studies provide evidence that mops condylurus , an insectivorous microbat , is also an ebolavirus reservoir .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	npc1 receptor expression in the context of ebolavirus replication in microbat cells remains unstudied .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	in order to study ebola virus ( ebov ) cellular entry and replication in m. condylurus , we derived primary and immortalized cell cultures from 12 different organs .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	the npc1 receptor expression was characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry comparing the expression levels of m. condylurus primary and immortalized cells , hela cells , human embryonic kidney cells and cells from a european microbat species .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	ebov replication kinetics was studied for four representative cell cultures using qrt - pcr .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	the aim was to elucidate the suitability of primary and immortalized cells from different tissues for studying npc1 receptor expression levels and their potential influence on ebov replication .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	the npc1 receptor expression level in m. condylurus primary cells differed depending on the organ they were derived from and was for most cell types significantly lower than in human cell lines .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	immortalized cells showed for most cell types higher expression levels than their corresponding primary cells .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	concluding from our infection experiments with ebov we suggest a potential correlation between npc1 receptor expression level and virus replication rate in vitro .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	although there have been ebola virus ( ebov ) outbreaks for more than 40 years , the animal natural reservoir that maintains this virus in nature has not been identified .

0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	cells from various organs of this bat were isolated in culture and tested for the presence of npc1 .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	most bat cell types had a lower amount of npc1 compared to the tested human cells .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	these bat cells were also less efficiently infected by ebov , indicating adaptation to ebov .
0888dc82af046111c582d80c53785491979bb9a3	these results suggest low levels of virus replication in the respective tissues of m. condylurus and might be indicative of a virus - natural reservoir relationship .

7a0da4f2fa4aa0d32a6590cc1fbe33fcb1bf2b86	engineering a csp system requires the combination of human and machine computation elements .
7a0da4f2fa4aa0d32a6590cc1fbe33fcb1bf2b86	from a general systems theory perspective , this means taking into account inherited as well as emerging properties from both these elements .
7a0da4f2fa4aa0d32a6590cc1fbe33fcb1bf2b86	in this paper , we position csp systems within a broader taxonomy , outline a series of design principles and evaluation metrics , present an extensible framework for their design , and describe several design patterns .
7a0da4f2fa4aa0d32a6590cc1fbe33fcb1bf2b86	we showcase the capabilities of csp systems by performing a case study that applies our proposed framework to the design and analysis of a real system ( aidr ) that classifies social media messages during time - critical crisis events .
7a0da4f2fa4aa0d32a6590cc1fbe33fcb1bf2b86	results show that compared to a pure stream processing system , aidr can achieve a higher data classification accuracy , while compared to a pure crowdsourcing solution , the system makes better use of human workers by requiring much less manual work effort .

1b2079db92924c2ee758d437394789b4822d0327	we examined whether the in - hospital mortality of patients in taiwan treated with iabp has recently declined .
1b2079db92924c2ee758d437394789b4822d0327	we used taiwan 's national health insurance research database to retrospectively review the in - hospital all - cause mortality of 9952 ( 7146 men [ 71.8 % ] ) 18-year - old and older patients treated with iabp between 1998 and 2008 .
1b2079db92924c2ee758d437394789b4822d0327	the mortality rate was 13.84 % ( n = 1377 ) .

1b2079db92924c2ee758d437394789b4822d0327	seven thousand six hundred thirty - five patients ( 76.72 % ) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) surgery , and 576 ( 5.79 % ) underwent high - risk pci with iabp treatment .
1b2079db92924c2ee758d437394789b4822d0327	the number of patients treated with iabp significantly increased during this decade ( p trend < 0.0001 ) , the in - hospital all - cause mortality for patients treated with iabp significantly decreased ( p trend = 0.0243 ) , but the in - hospital all - cause mortality of patients who underwent cabg and pci plus iabp did not decrease .
1b2079db92924c2ee758d437394789b4822d0327	in conclusion , the in - hospital mortality rate of iabp treatment decreased annually in taiwan during the study period .
1b2079db92924c2ee758d437394789b4822d0327	however , high - risk patients who underwent coronary revascularization with iabp had a higher and unstable in - hospital mortality rate .

2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	however , unlike traditional big data systems , these data structures typically reside in shared memory accessed by multiple cores .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	although popular , this emerging hybrid paradigm opens the door to possibly detrimental behavior , such as thread contention and bugs related to non - execution and non - determinism .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	this study explores the use and misuse of a popular streaming api , namely , java 8 streams .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	the focus is on how developers decide whether or not to run these operations sequentially or in parallel and bugs both specific and tangential to this paradigm .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	our study involved analyzing 34 java projects and 5.53 million lines of code , along with 719 manually examined code patches .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	various automated , including interprocedural static analysis , and manual methodologies were employed .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	the results indicate that streams are pervasive , parallelization is not widely used , and performance is a crosscutting concern that accounted for the majority of fixes .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	we also present coincidences that both confirm and contradict the results of related studies .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	the study advances our understanding of streams , as well as benefits practitioners , programming language and api designers , tool developers , and educators alike .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	traditional big data systems , for which mapreduce is a popular backbone [ 3 ] , minimize the complexity of writing massively distributed programs by facilitating processing on multiple nodes using succinct functional - like constructs .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	this makes writing parallel code easier , as writing such code can be difficult due to possible data races , thread interference , and contention [ 1 , 4 , 28 ] .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	the code above , e.g. , can execute in parallel simply by replacing stream ( ) with parallelstream ( ) .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	however , unlike traditional big data systems , data structures processed by streaming apis like java 8 streams typically reside in shared memory accessed by multiple cores .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	therefore , issues may arise from the close intimacy between shared memory and the operations being performed , especially for developers not previously familiar with functional programming .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	streams are not just an api but rather an emerging , hybrid paradigm .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	to obtain the expressiveness , speed , and parallelism that streams have to offer , developers must adopt the paradigm as well as the api [ 6 , ch . 7 ] .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	this requires determining whether running stream code in parallel yields an efficient yet interference - free program [ 24 ] and ensuring that no operations on different threads interleave [ 42 ] .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	despite the benefits [ 53 , ch . 1 ] , misusing streams may result in detrimental behavior , and the ∼4 k questions related to streams on stack overflow [ 48 ] , of which ∼5 % remain unanswered , suggest that there is ample confusion surrounding the topic .
2588eeaedd7d7d238cb65e09ad54c4de0212d36d	bugs related to thread contention ( due to λ - expressions , i.e. , units of computation , side - effects , buffering ) , non - execution ( due to deferred execution ) , non - determinism ( due to non - deterministic operations ) , operation sequencing ( ordering of stream operations ) , and data ordering ( ordering of stream data ) can lead to programs that undermine concurrency , underperform , are incorrect , and are inefficient .

7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	since pulmonary infections can be observed through radiography images , this paper investigates deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest x - ray images with the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the covid-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	in this context , training datasets , deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from publicly open sets of chest x - ray images .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	tailored deep learning models are proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases , notably viral cases .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	it is assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic covid-19 context have a high probability to presume covid-19 infections .
7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	moreover , easyto - apply health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting patient status from the detected pneumonia cases .

7c187e1e6a175d79be87548270c893b25967e9b6	the efficiency of proposed health indicators is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data .

03342c6c4dc00715c4fe0cce51b6df10f8b99c81	notably , relational mobility scores were uniform across brazilian regions and states , indicating a common national culture regarding the amount of opportunities brazilians have in selecting new relationship partners within their social context .
03342c6c4dc00715c4fe0cce51b6df10f8b99c81	replicating existing findings , relational mobility was positively associated with pro - active tendencies that help people retain relationships - levels of intimacy and self - disclosure toward a close friend - indicating that friends tend to feel closer intimacy to their close friends , and reveal serious personal information to a larger degree in social contexts where opportunities to find and retain relationships with like - minded others are greater .

1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	to study this , we choose economic production networks as a paradigm .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	an economic network can be examined at many levels - linkages among individual agents ( microscopic ) , among firms / sectors ( mesoscopic ) or among countries ( macroscopic ) .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	new emergent dynamical properties appear at every level , so the granularity matters .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	for viral epidemics , even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and potentially affect the entire network .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	economic networks , however , are known to be immune at the micro - levels and more prone to failure in the meso / macro - levels .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	we propose a dynamical interaction model to characterize the mechanism of distress propagation , across different modules of a network , initiated at different epicenters .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	vulnerable modules often lead to large degrees of destabilization .
1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320	we demonstrate our methodology using a unique empirical data - set of input - output linkages across 0.14 million firms in one administrative state of india , a developing economy .

1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	we disinfected surfaces contaminated with h1n1 influenza viruses using hydrogen peroxide ( hp ) vapor at concentrations below 100 ppm and triethylene glycol ( teg)-saturated air containing 2 ppm of teg at 258c. methodsinfluenza viruses in aqueous suspensions were deposited on stainless - steel coupons , allowed to dry at ambient conditions , and then exposed for up to 15 minutes to 10 to 90 ppm of hp vapor or teg - saturated air .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	virus assays were done on the solution used to wash the viruses from these coupons and from coupons treated similarly but without exposure to hp or teg vapor .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	results : after 2.5 minutes , exposure to 10-ppm hp vapor resulted in 99 % inactivation .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	for air saturated with teg at 25 to 298c , the disinfection rate was about 1.3 log 10 reductions per hour , about 16 times faster than the measured natural inactivation rate under ambient conditions .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	conclusions :
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	vapor concentrations of 10 ppm hp or 2 ppm teg can provide effective surface disinfection .
1e668438cb5f168adef29581a67d9f703ac9622a	at these low concentrations , the potential for damage to even the avionics of an airplane would be expected to be minimal .

97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) is an economically devastating enteric disease in the swine industry .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	the virus infects pigs of all ages , but it cause severe clinical disease in neonatal suckling pigs with up to 100 % mortality .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	currently , available vaccines are not completely effective and feedback methods utilizing pedv infected material has variable success in preventing reinfection .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	comprehensive information on the levels and duration of effector / memory iga and igg antibody secreting b cell response in the intestines and lymphoid organs of pedv - infected sows , and their association with specific antibody levels in clinical samples such as plasma , oral fluid , and
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	feces is important .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	therefore , our goal in this study was to quantify pedv specific iga and igg b cell responses in sows at approximately 1 and 6 months post - infection in commercial swine herds , including parity one and higher sows .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	our data indicated that evaluation of both pedv specific iga and igg antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid ( but not feces ) samples is beneficial in disease diagnosis .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	pedv specific b cell response in the intestine and spleen of infected sows decline by 6 months , and this associates with specific antibody levels in the plasma and oral fluid samples ; but the virus neutralization titers in plasma remains high beyond 6 months post - infection .
97bdba1d4a122241576c1e180ca7ce848cb657a3	in conclusion , in sows infected with pedv the presence of effector / memory b cell response and strong virus neutralization titers in plasma up to 6 months postinfection , suggests their potential to protect sows from reinfection and provide maternal immunity to neonates , but challenge studies are required to confirm such responses .

2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	infectious or contagious diseases can be transmitted from one person to another through social contact networks .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	in today 's interconnected global society , such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards , as exemplified by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	it is therefore of great practical relevance to investigate the network transmission of contagious diseases from the perspective of statistical inference .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	an important and widely studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the so - called epidemic threshold .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	the epidemic threshold plays a key role in determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will cause an epidemic or die out .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	in this paper , we investigate epidemic thresholds from the perspective of statistical network inference .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	we identify two major challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the epidemic threshold .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	we develop two statistically accurate and computationally efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the chung - lu modeling framework .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	the second approximation , which is based on random walk sampling , further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small fraction of nodes .
2a3f1cc1895fff6677e40c70586f2e39fca89456	we establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and demonstrate their empirical superiority .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	work with highly pathogenic material mandates the use of biological containment facilities , involving microbiological safety cabinets and specialist laboratory engineering structures typified by containment level 3 ( cl3 ) and cl4 laboratories .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	consequences of working in high containment are the practical difficulties associated with containing specialist assays and equipment often essential for experimental analyses .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	in an era of increased interest in biodefence pathogens and emerging diseases , immunological analysis has developed rapidly alongside traditional techniques in virology and molecular biology .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	for example , in order to maximise the use of small sample volumes , multiplexing has become a more popular and widespread approach to quantify multiple analytes simultaneously , such as cytokines and chemokines .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	the luminex microsphere system allows for the detection of many cytokines and chemokines in a single sample , but the detection method of using aligned lasers and fluidics means that samples often have to be analysed in low containment facilities .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	in order to perform cytokine analysis in materials from high containment ( cl3 and cl4 laboratories ) , we have developed an appropriate inactivation methodology after staining steps , which although results in a reduction of median fluorescent intensity , produces statistically comparable outcomes when judged against non - inactivated samples .
461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7	this methodology thus extends the use of luminex technology for material that contains highly pathogenic biological agents .

39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	to date , no drugs or vaccines have been employed to improve clinical outcomes for rsv - infected patients .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	in this paper , we report that angiotensin - converting enzyme-2 ( ace2 ) protected against severe lung injury induced by rsv infection in an experimental mouse model and in pediatric patients .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	moreover , ace2 deficiency aggravated rsv - associated disease pathogenesis , mainly by its action on the angiotensin ii type 1 receptor ( at1r ) .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	furthermore , administration of a recombinant ace2 protein alleviated the severity of rsv - induced lung injury .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	these findings demonstrate that ace2 plays a critical role in preventing rsv - induced lung injury , and suggest that ace2 is a promising potential therapeutic target in the management of rsv - induced lung disease .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	human respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is a non - segmented , negative - sense , single - stranded rna virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	rsv is the most common virus responsible for acute and severe lower airway diseases in infants and young children , with nearly all children experiencing at least one rsv infection by the age of 2 years 1 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	according to the world health organization ( who ) , approximately 34 million new pediatric cases of rsv - associated lower airway disease occur annually worldwide ; most cases occur in developing countries , with a mortality rate of nearly 200,000 annually 2,3 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	despite the significant impact of rsv infection on infant morbidity and mortality , treatment options remain largely limited to supportive care 4 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	currently , ribavirin is the only antiviral drug that has been approved for treatment of rsv - infected airway diseases , although issues with its efficacy and side effects restrict its application in immunocompromised patients 5 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	the high incidence of rsv infection and its potential to cause severe respiratory tract disease in vulnerable young children , combined with the limited availability of therapeutic options , highlight an urgent unmet global human health need .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) plays a major role in maintaining blood pressure , and electrolyte and fluid homeostasis 6 - 8 .

39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	( ace ) gene was reported to negatively regulate ras by converting angiotensin ( ang)-ii to ang-1 - 7 9 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	previous studies , from our group and others , have demonstrated that ace2 protects against severe acute lung injury ( ali ) that can be triggered by sepsis , acid aspiration , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , and the lethal avian influenza a h5n1 virus 10 - 12 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	moreover , ace2 has been identified as the receptor of the sars coronavirus 11 , and has also been found to modulate innate immunity and influence the composition of gut microbiota 13 .
39855ca915f908855de8577baf009e5b1acf5f5c	more importantly , a recombinant ace2 protein has proven to be effective in improving lung pathologies associated with ali and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) induced by viruses including sars and influenza 12 , 14 , 15 .

a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	the diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	we employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers ( or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted ) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	currently proposed covid-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10x scale - up .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	there is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	we investigated if further improvement is available , especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row - column group testing or reed - solomon error correcting codes .
a1ce59caa688414b49c9c78d46e87bba7b91eeab	therefore , we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly .

d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	sars - cov n is released from cells through an association with e protein - containing vesicles .
d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	further analysis suggests that domains involved in e / n interaction are largely located in both carboxyl - terminal regions .
d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	changing all three e cysteine residues to alanines did not exert negative effects on e release , e association with n , or e enhancement of vlp production , suggesting that e palmitoylation modification or disulfide bond formation is not required for sars - cov virus assembly .
d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	we found that removal of the last e carboxyl - terminal residue markedly affected e release , n association , and vlp incorporation , but did not significantly compromise the contribution of e to efficient vlp production .
d2d7428869cef29308728dd3a05f0facaf1d25da	the independence of the sars - cov e enhancement effect on vlp production from its viral packaging capacity suggests a distinct sars - cov e role in virus assembly .

439ddbbdb17f5ab18ac2e208e7df5c09a8dc9789	gastrointestinal symptoms , in particular diarrhoea , are common in non - treated hiv-1 infected individuals .
439ddbbdb17f5ab18ac2e208e7df5c09a8dc9789	although various enteric pathogens have been implicated , the aetiology of diarrhoea remains unexplained in a large proportion of hiv-1 infected patients .
439ddbbdb17f5ab18ac2e208e7df5c09a8dc9789	our aim is to identify the cause of diarrhoea for patients that remain negative in routine diagnostics .
439ddbbdb17f5ab18ac2e208e7df5c09a8dc9789	methods :
439ddbbdb17f5ab18ac2e208e7df5c09a8dc9789	in this study stool samples of 196 hiv-1 infected persons , including 29 persons with diarrhoea , were examined for enteropathogens and hiv-1 .
439ddbbdb17f5ab18ac2e208e7df5c09a8dc9789	a search for unknown and unexpected viruses was performed using virus discovery cdna - aflp combined with roche-454 sequencing ( vidisca-454 ) .
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	objectives :
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	we examined 17 health information portals to determine the status of web - based health information services in the united states ( usa ) , south korea , the united kingdom ( uk ) , and australia .
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	methods :
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	we analyzed longitudinal trends in 35 items of online health information over four years among representative health information portals ( eight based in the usa , seven in south korea , one in the uk , and one in australia ) , focusing on external portal structure , content scope , service characteristic , and service function with four stakeholder groups of six stakeholders .
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	results :
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	the most notable change was in the service items , and overall , in 44.1 % of total items :
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	17.6 % in service characteristic , 41.2 % in external portal structure , 58.8 % in service function , and 58.8 % in content scope change .
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	more specifically , these changes included increases in the " mobile application utility " ( service function ) , " use of personal health records " on public health portals ( content scope change ) , " charts and videos " ( service characteristic ) , and " renewal date " ( external portal structure ) .
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	conclusions :
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	this review of existing health portals will be a footnote for enabling health care providers to confirm whether the needs of consumers are reflected on their website with high reliability .
2855de519ec7863d818a008af514b71ed8274f85	furthermore , these findings will help to enhance the quality of portals by delivering relevant information to stakeholders and to the consumers of online health information .

2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	cases were analysed for general characteristics , exposure source , timeline and infection generation .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	sex , age and underlying diseases were analysed for the 38 deaths .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	findings :
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	beginning with the index case that infected 28 others , an in - depth analysis was conducted .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	the average age was 55 years , which was a little higher than the global average of 50 years .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	as in most other countries , more men than women were affected .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	the case fatality rate was 19.9 % , which was lower than the global rate of 38.7 % and the rate in saudi arabia ( 36.5 % ) .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	in total , 184 patients were infected nosocomially and there were no communityacquired infections .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	the main underlying diseases were respiratory diseases , cancer and hypertension .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	the main contributors to the outbreak were late diagnosis , quarantine failure of ' super spreaders ' , familial care - giving and visiting , non - disclosure by patients , poor communication by the south korean government , inadequate hospital infection management , and ' doctor shopping ' .
2a0290c698f1d7cdf55b17e11286c9daaaaaaa81	the outbreak was entirely nosocomial , and was largely attributable to infection management and policy failures , rather than biomedical factors .
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	throughout the past six months , no number has dominated the public media more persistently than the reproduction number of covid-19 .
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	this powerful but simple concept is widely used by the public media , scientists , and political decision makers to explain and justify political strategies to control the covid-19 pandemic .
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of covid-19 across europe .
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	we propose a dynamic seir epidemiology model with a time - varying reproduction number , which we identify using machine learning .
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	during the early outbreak , the basic reproduction number was 4.22 ± 1.69 , with maximum values of 6.33 and 5.88 in germany and the netherlands .
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	by may 10 , 2020 , it dropped to 0.67 ± 0.18 , with minimum values of 0.37 and 0.28 in hungary and slovakia .
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	we found a strong correlation between passenger air travel , driving , walking , and transit mobility and the effective reproduction number with a time delay of 17.24 ± 2.00 days .
b510b21df9c5a6be2fe50495ea50eecaeb528358	our new dynamic seir model provides the flexibility to simulate various outbreak control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify safe solutions in the benefit of global health .

150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	1 background :
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	the colloidal gold immunochromatography assay ( gica ) is a rapid 2 diagnostic tool for novel coronavirus disease 2019 infections .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	however , 3 with significant numbers of false negatives , improvements to gica are needed .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	4 methods :
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	six recombinant hcov-19 nucleocapsid and spike proteins were prepared 5 and evaluated .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	the optimal proteins were employed to develop a sandwich - format 6 gica strip to detect total antibodies ( igm and igg ) against hcov-19 .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	gica 's 7 performance was assessed with comparison of viral rna detection .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	8 results :
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	recombinant hcov-19 proteins were obtained , including three 9 prokaryotically expressed rn , rn1 , rn2 nucleocapsid proteins , and three 10 eukaryotically expressed rs1 , rs - rbd , rs - rbd - mfc spike proteins .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	the recombinant 11 proteins with the highest elisa titers ( rs1 and rs - rbd - mfc ) against 12 coronavirus - specific igm and igg were chosen for gica development .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	the gica 13 has a sensitivity and specificity of 86.89 % ( 106/122 ) and 99.39 % ( 656/660 ) , 14 respectively .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	furthermore , 65.63 % ( 21/32 ) of the clinically confirmed but rt - pcr 15 negative samples were gica positive .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	16
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	the eukaryotically - expressed spike proteins ( rs1and rs - rbd - mfc ) are 17 more suitable than the prokaryotically expressed nucleocapsid proteins for hcov-19 18 serological diagnosis .
150e2f3f41b18cb2ef42ce896e416ae62c9169eb	the gica sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a 19 powerful complement to the current standard rna - based tests .
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	with new cases of covid-19 surging in the united states , we need to better understand how the spread of novel coronavirus varies across all segments of the population .
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	we use hierarchical exponential growth curve modeling techniques to examine whether community social and economic characteristics uniquely influence the incidence of covid-19 cases in the urban built environment .
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	we show that , as of may 3 , 2020 , confirmed coronavirus infections are concentrated along demographic and socioeconomic lines in new york city and surrounding areas , the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic in the united states .
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	furthermore , we see evidence that , after the onset of the pandemic , timely enactment of physical distancing measures such as school closures is imperative in order to limit the extent of the coronavirus spread in the population .
d79e9e36cd9f5432f246877c1f1bee49aeaf0b45	public health authorities must impose nonpharmaceutical measures early on in the pandemic and consider community - level factors that associate with a greater risk of viral transmission .

083c334f893138f09bf9f62ee55e50328201f7fb	the spread of covid-19 throughout italy , particularly lombardy , led to adopt quarantine measures , known to exacerbate pre - existing psychiatric conditions .
083c334f893138f09bf9f62ee55e50328201f7fb	we described a telephone - based surveillance on 101 euthymic mood disorder outpatients in milan by a non - standardized survey to evaluate reactions to lockdown measures and the presence of quarantine stressors .
083c334f893138f09bf9f62ee55e50328201f7fb	frustration was the most represented quarantine stressor .
083c334f893138f09bf9f62ee55e50328201f7fb	being jobless was significantly related to the presence of frustration , somatization , increased alertness , psychic anxiety and low mood ; younger age to the presence of psychic anxiety , alertness and financial concerns .

20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	the novel coronavirus disease-19
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	( covid-19 ) pandemic has posed several challenges for neuromuscular disorder ( nmd ) patients .
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	the risk of a severe course of sars - cov-2 infection is increased in all but the mildest forms of nmds .
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	high - risk conditions include reduced airway clearance due to oropharyngeal weakness and risk of worsening with fever , fasting or infection isolation requirements may have an impact on treatment regimens administered in hospital settings , such as nusinersen , glucosidase alfa , intravenous immunoglobulin , and rituximab infusions .
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	in addition , specific drugs for sars - cov2 infection under investigation impair neuromuscular function significantly ; chloroquine and azithromycin are not recommended in myasthenia gravis without available ventilatory support and prolonged prone positioning may influence options for treatment .
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	other therapeutics may affect specific nmds ( metabolic , mitochondrial , myotonic diseases ) and experimental approaches for coronavirus disease 2019 may be offered " compassionately " only after consulting the patient 's nmd specialist .
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	in parallel , the reorganization of hospital and outpatient services may change the management of non - infected nmd patients and their caregivers , favouring at - distance approaches .
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	however , the literature on the validation of telehealth in this subgroup of patients is scant .
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	thus , as the first wave of the pandemic is progressing , clinicians and researchers should address these crucial open issues to ensure adequate caring for nmd patients .
20cb60c4b88f6bfd5aeb946e3c404616c2bf6497	this manuscript summarizes available evidence so far and provides guidance for both general neurologists and nmd specialists dealing with nmd patients in the time of covid-19 .
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	the coronavirus disease belongs to the family severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars - cov ) .
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	it can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties resulting in the death of immune - compromised patients .
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	we performed a phylogenomic and phylogeographic tree from the collected datasets .
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	phylogenomic analysis or sequence - based phylogeny showed an evolutionary relationship between the geographical strains .
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	the phylogenomic tree grouped into two major clades consists of various isolates of sars - cov-2 and bat sars - like coronavirus , bat coronavirus , and pangolin coronavirus .
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	the phylogenetic neighbor of newly sequenced indian strains ( accession : mt012098.1 , mt050493.1 ) was revealed to identify the variations between the ncov-19 strains .
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	the results showed keen evidence that sars - cov-2 has evolved from bat sars - like coronavirus .
42c61a52af09c70345077b381f1d28601c1a5b69	the evolutionary history and comparative proteomic analysis provide a new avenue for the current scientific research related to the coronavirus .
9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	the objective of this study was to compare the effect of non - gmo saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation products ( scfp ) with that of a halofuginone treatment against cryptosporidium parvum infection in pre - weaned calves on a commercial dairy farm .
9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	a total of 123 neonatal female calves , housed in individual hutches , were enrolled sequentially based on date of birth in 41 blocks of 3 animals each .

9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	4 - 21 post - partum were examined for both cryptosporidium oocysts and coproantigen .
9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	the presence and intensity of diarrhea were monitored by scoring daily for the first 4 weeks of life .
9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	calves were weighed at 0 , 21 , 42 and 63 days of age .
9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	almost all calves were cryptosporidium - positive at least once during the study .
9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	halofuginone significantly reduced the number of cryptosporidium - positive fecal samples as compared to the two other groups .
9cbda17d77d5e6990cd7da048727a59f579e9261	based on the coproantigen scores , both halofuginone and scfp feeding significantly reduced the intensity of cryptosporidium infection as compared to the untreated group .

27d47347e18de0e85c9de145ab9b4f95b11601a1	the predominant pathological process of sars is diffuse alveolar damage and , in patients who die from the disease , there is evidence of organization and fibrosis .
27d47347e18de0e85c9de145ab9b4f95b11601a1	there are apparently no histological features specific for this disease , and the aetiological diagnosis depends on virological and ultrastructural studies .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	background : severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus ( sftsv ) , which can cause hemorrhagic fever - like illness , is a newly discovered bunyavirus in china .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	the pathogenesis of sftsv infection is poorly understood .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	however , it has been suggested that immune mechanisms , including cytokines and chemokines , play an important role in disease pathogenesis .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	in the present study , we investigated host cytokine and chemokine profiles in serum samples of patients with sftsv infection from northeast china and explored a possible correlation between cytokine levels and disease severity .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	methods and principal findings :
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	acute phase serum samples from 40 patients , diagnosed with sftsv infection were included .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	patients were divided into two groups -severe or non - severe -based on disease severity .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	levels of tumor necrosis factor ( tnf)-a , transforming growth factor ( tgf)-b , interleukin-6 , interferon ( ifn)-c , ifn - c - induced protein ( ip)-10 and rantes were measured in the serum samples with commercial elisas .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	statistical analysis showed that increases in tnf - a ,
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	ip-10 and ifn - c were associated with disease severity .
3fe4e2a98af36485a9a4dc93c30eef62522af0e0	we suggest that a cytokine - mediated inflammatory response , characterized by cytokine and chemokine production imbalance , might be in part responsible for the disease progression of patients with sftsv infection .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	zika virus ( zikv ) is a highly transmissive virus that belongs to the flaviviridae family , which comprises several other pathogens that threaten human health .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	this re - emerging virus gained attention during the outbreak in brazil in 2016 , where a considerable number of microcephaly cases in newborns was associated with zikv infection during pregnancy .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	lacking a preventive vaccine or antiviral drugs , efforts have been made to better understand the viral life cycle .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	in light of this , the relevance of the endosomal - lysosomal compartment for the zikv life cycle was investigated .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	a549 and sh - sy5y cells were infected with either the african strain ( associated with mild symptoms ) or the french polynesia strain ( associated with neurological complications ) .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	for both strains , the v - atpase inhibitor , bafilomycin a1 , efficiently inhibited zikv entry and prevented the spread of the infection by interfering with viral maturation .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	additionally , affecting cholesterol metabolism and transport with the drug u18666a , which inactivates late endosomes and lysosomes , impairs the viral life cycle .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	the data presented show a clear antiviral effect of two compounds that target the same compartments in different ways .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	this highlights the relevance of the endosomal - lysosomal compartment for the viral life cycle that should be considered as a target for antivirals .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	viruses 2019 , 11 , 524 2 of 25 life cycle initiates with the interaction between the viral envelope protein and the host cell receptors and adhesion / entry factors , such as dc - sign , axl , tyro3 and tim-1 [ 15 ] .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	nevertheless , there are conflicting data about the relevance of axl as the primary receptor of zikv entry [ 16 ]
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	[ 17 ] [ 18 ] .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	after internalization via receptor - mediated endocytosis , it is assumed that the acidification of the late endosomes , also termed multivesicular bodies ( mvbs ) , promotes a structural change in the viral envelope , allowing the fusion between the endosomal membrane and the envelope .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	this leads to the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm and , consequently , to the disassembling of the capsid and the uncoating of the viral rna [ 19 , 20 ] .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	after the genomic rna has been translated and replicated , a newly synthesized immature viral particle is assembled and conducted to the secretory pathway .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	in this immature form , the pr peptide covers approximately 12 amino acids of the fusion loop of the envelope protein and , thus , prevents premature fusion within the cell .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	in the trans - golgi network ( tgn ) , the viral particle undergoes maturation as a result of a structural modification induced by the low ph that allows the cleavage of the prm by a furin - like protease , exposing the fusion loop .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	lastly , the infectious viral particle exits the cell by exocytosis and the pr fragment dissociates from the virion due to the neutral
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	ph of the extracellular environment [ 21 , 22 ] .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	besides the bite of an infected mosquito ( aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus ) , zikv infection can occur through perinatal transmission , sexual contact and blood transfusion [ 23 ]
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	[ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	since there is no vaccine or a specific antiviral drug available against zikv , understanding the viral life cycle and finding ways to control infection has become urgent .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	although the zikv life cycle is often described to resemble the life cycle of other flavivirus members , a variety of open questions with respect to the viral life cycle still exists .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	in light of this , the importance of the endosomal - lysosomal compartment for the zikv life cycle was investigated .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	firstly , the acidification of the late endosomes / mvbs and the tgn compartments was impaired by the highly selective inhibitor of the vacuolar h

a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	the relevance of the acidification of the endosomal compartment for zikv entry has been previously studied in huh 7 cells by cortese et al . , more recently , .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	our data from a549 cells show that on the one hand , bafilomycin a1 was able to fully inhibit zikv entry and , on the other hand , it interferes with viral maturation .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	concerning the sh - sy5y cells , bafilomycin a1 decreased zikv entry .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	in the second part of this study , the functionality of the late endosomes and lysosomes was hindered by the amphipathic steroid drug , u18666a. u18666a inhibits the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol and lipids by the direct inhibition of the niemann - pick type c protein .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	this results in cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes / mvbs and lysosomes , which leads to the impairment of their functionality [ 31 ] .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	several reports showed that u18666a inhibits crucial steps of dengue virus , hepatitis c virus , ebola virus and feline coronavirus life cycles [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	however , no studies were performed to investigate the impact of u18666a on zikv infection .
a07e1b3380d19de30b382b8d64c6c820965e8091	this work provides further insights into the zikv life cycle and elucidates crucial steps for viral entry and release .

1fe489779a103b0469c72074bf1ac85ec2b8b943	the geneva protocol of 1925 commits the signatory nations to refraining from the use of biological weapons .
1fe489779a103b0469c72074bf1ac85ec2b8b943	however , the terrorist assaults of september 2001 and , subsequently , the anthrax - containing letters are cause for great concerns : new threats to the security of nations are expected , as terrorist organizations seem to increasingly explore novel ways of spreading terror .
1fe489779a103b0469c72074bf1ac85ec2b8b943	in this context , naturally emerging diseases such as sars , monkeypox or west nile fever assume new importance because it is difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and possible bioweapon assaults .
1fe489779a103b0469c72074bf1ac85ec2b8b943	great efforts on the part of governments and public health authorities are necessary to counteract these threats .

7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	adults with chronic conditions such as heart disease , diabetes , or lung disease are more likely to develop complications from a number of vaccine - preventable diseases , including influenza and pneumonia .
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	in this study , we use the data from a chronic disease management information system in shanghai to estimate vaccination coverage and characterize predictors of seasonal influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( ppsv23 ) vaccination among people with chronic disease in shanghai .
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	methods :
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	the shanghai centers for disease control and prevention have information systems related to chronic disease management , hospital records , and immunizations .
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	data from individuals with hypertension , diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) were abstracted during july 2017 .
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	the main outcome was coverage of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination .
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	vaccination coverage was calculated across demographic groups .
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	significance in bivariate associations was assessed through pearson 's chi - square tests , and in multivariable models through logistic regression models with a forward stepwise method to select variables .
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	results :
7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786	in the sample of 2,531,227 individuals ≥15 years , 22.8 % were vaccinated for pneumonia from

4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	traditional smallpox vaccines , essentially vaccinia virus strains , that were used in the eradication of smallpox were administered by percutaneous inoculation ( skin scarification ) .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	the modified vaccinia virus ankara is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in europe and canada and currently undergoing clinical development in the united states .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	mva is also being investigated as a vector for the delivery of heterologous genes for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	since mva is replication - deficient , mva and mvavectored vaccines are often inoculated through the intramuscular , intradermal or subcutaneous routes .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	vaccine inoculation via the intramuscular , intradermal or subcutaneous routes requires the use of injection needles , and an estimated 10 to 20 % of the population of the united states has needle phobia .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	following an observation in our laboratory that a replication - deficient recombinant vaccinia virus derived from the new york city board of health strain elicited protective immune responses in a mouse model upon inoculation by tail scarification , we investigated whether mva and mva recombinants can elicit protective responses following percutaneous administration in mouse models .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	our data suggest that mva administered by percutaneous inoculation , elicited vaccinia - specific antibody responses , and protected mice from lethal vaccinia virus challenge , at levels comparable to or better than subcutaneous or intramuscular inoculation .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	high titers of specific neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice inoculated with a recombinant mva expressing the herpes simplex type 2 glycoprotein d after scarification .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	similarly , a recombinant mva expressing the hemagglutinin of attenuated influenza virus rga / viet nam/1203/2004
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	( h5n1 ) elicited protective immune responses when administered at low doses by scarification .
4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a	taken together , our data suggest that mva and mva - vectored vaccines inoculated by scarification can elicit protective immune responses that are comparable to subcutaneous vaccination , and may allow for antigen sparing when vaccine supply is limited .

933687347f9e66728f64b7a6645067e15e5cf0bd	meanwhile , the decrease of no x caused the rise of o 3 by up to 2.3 times due to the volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) limitation .
933687347f9e66728f64b7a6645067e15e5cf0bd	the aerosol light absorption coefficient at multiple wavelengths decreased by 50 % , and aae decreased by 20 % during the level 1 rmphe .
933687347f9e66728f64b7a6645067e15e5cf0bd	brc played essential roles in light absorption after the rmphe was announced , accounting for 54.0 % of the aerosol absorption coefficient at 370 nm .
933687347f9e66728f64b7a6645067e15e5cf0bd	moreover , the lockdown down - weighted the fraction of fossil fuel in bc concentrations to 0.43 ( minima ) .

0c742273e4a9e7413b14889eca0b2474076c02dc	thus , the need to simplify procedures , reduce costs of the techniques used , and expand the capacity of the number of diagnostics of covid-19 is imperative .
0c742273e4a9e7413b14889eca0b2474076c02dc	in this study , detection of sars - cov-2 in the absence of rna extraction has been successfully achieved through pre - treatment of the clinical sample with proteinase k.
0c742273e4a9e7413b14889eca0b2474076c02dc	the results show that only the use of proteinase k , without the need to perform the whole standard protocol for sample extraction and purification , can be an efficient technique for the diagnosis of covid-19 , since 91 % of the samples matched the results with the standard procedure , with an average increase of 5.64 ct in the rt - qpcr .

6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	since the outbreak of coronavirus diseases 2019
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	( covid-19 ) , many researchers in china have immediately carried out clinical research scheme of the covid-19 .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	but , there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	therefore , we made the first systematic review of the clinical trials of covid-19 in order to provide evidence for the control of the covid-19 .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	methods :
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	the database from the chinese clinical registration center and the clinicaltrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of covid-19 .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	the retrieval inception date is february 9 , 2020 .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	two evaluators independently selected literature , extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	this study is based on the recommendations of prisma in cochrane handbook .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	results :
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	a total of 75 covid-19 registered clinical trials ( 63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies ) were obtained .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	97.3 % of clinical trials were initiated by chinese organizations .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients , and all registered clinical trials have not been completed .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre - experiment stage ( only two trials of remdesivir in ⅲ stage ) , and the sample size of subjects recruited is small .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	the main intervention methods include traditional chinese medicine treatment , western medicine treatment and integrated chinese and western medicine treatment .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	the subjects were mainly non severe adult patients ( ≥ 18 years old ) .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	the main outcomes were clinical observation and examination .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	the duration of most trials was more than 5 months , and the median of the intervention study was 180 d ( 95 % ci : 146.3 -328.9 d ) ;
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	the median of the observation period was 334 d ( 95 % ci : 166.6 -363.4 d ) .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	overall , both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	conclusions : disorderly and intensive clinical trials of covid-19 using traditional chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in china .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	however , based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period , we will not be able to obtain reliable , high - quality clinical evidence about covid-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future .
6efe01046ce81279412ea440a4b246f942f29124	improving the quality of study design , prioritizing promising drugs , and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of covid-19 in china .
5620b3dd737e499551fcbcb45de6f8808c7e3362	the epidemiological emergency caused by has changed priorities in breast cancer management .
5620b3dd737e499551fcbcb45de6f8808c7e3362	in those places where the pandemic has had the greatest effect , it is of paramount importance for most patients to be at home , reducing or postponing their attendance at clinics , as well as avoiding surgeries .
5620b3dd737e499551fcbcb45de6f8808c7e3362	in this scenario , neoadjuvant endocrine treatment could be an appropriate alternative treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer ( luminal - like tumours ) in order to minimise hospital admissions and to delay elective surgeries .
5620b3dd737e499551fcbcb45de6f8808c7e3362	accordingly , we present a simple protocol that can be applied to most cases of luminal - like breast cancer and is appropriate for the majority of secondary or tertiary medical centres , or even primary care .
b5827a58d3abf603bf7649ada7f69d380e8b3823	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) is a strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 and has been declared a global pandemic by the world health organization .
b5827a58d3abf603bf7649ada7f69d380e8b3823	total cases of sars - cov-2 worldwide exceed 4.8 million , with over 320,000 deaths recorded .
b5827a58d3abf603bf7649ada7f69d380e8b3823	little is known about the body 's immune response to sars - cov-2 infection .
b5827a58d3abf603bf7649ada7f69d380e8b3823	in this paper , we describe sars - cov-2 igg antibody responses in 11,092 patients from the new york city metropolitan area and report a sars - cov-2 igg positivity rate of nearly 50 % , indicating the widespread nature of the pandemic in the city and state of new york .
b5827a58d3abf603bf7649ada7f69d380e8b3823	additionally , we report on the correlation between sars - cov-2 patient symptom severity and level of sars - cov-2 igg antibody found in the patient sample .
b5827a58d3abf603bf7649ada7f69d380e8b3823	a number of in vitro diagnostics have been developed for the detection of antibodies against sars - cov-2 , and many fraudulent or ineffective tests have been released into the market ( 13 ) .
0c1fd058b624af98542525f9ab3768ad1b586605	maps have long been been used to visualise estimates of spatial variables , in particular disease burden and risk .
0c1fd058b624af98542525f9ab3768ad1b586605	predictions made using a geostatistical model have uncertainty that typically varies spatially .
0c1fd058b624af98542525f9ab3768ad1b586605	however , this uncertainty is difficult to map with the estimate itself and is often not included as a result , thereby generating a potentially misleading sense of certainty about disease burden or other important variables .
0c1fd058b624af98542525f9ab3768ad1b586605	to remedy this , we propose simultaneously visualising predictions and their associated uncertainty within a single map by varying pixel size .
0c1fd058b624af98542525f9ab3768ad1b586605	we illustrate our approach using examples of malaria incidence , but the method could be applied to predictions of any spatial continua with associated uncertainty .
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	introduction :
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	the covid-19 epidemic has led to the need for unprecedented decisions to be made to maintain the provision of neurological care .
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	this article addresses operational decisionmaking during the epidemic .
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	we report the measures taken , including the preparation of a functional reorganisation plan , strategies for hospitalisation and emergency management , the use of telephone consultations to maintain neurological care , provision of care at a unit outside the hospital for priority patients , decisions about complementary testing and periodic in - hospital treatments , and the use of a specific telephone service to prioritise patients with epileptic seizures .
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	conclusion :
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	despite the situation of confinement , neurology departments must continue to provide patient care through different means of operation .
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	like all elements of management , these must be evaluated .
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	:
96025005ff71058d667daf62e9849d69a0bf5b87	a pesar de la situación de aislamiento , los servicios de neurología deben mantener la atención de sus pacientes a través de distintas fórmulas operativas , que como cualquier elemento de gestión , deberán evaluarse .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	the spike ( s ) protein is a major structural glycoprotein of coronavirus ( cov ) , the causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	the s protein is a potent target for sars - specific cell - mediated immune responses .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	however , the mechanism cov pathogenesis in sars and the role of special ctls in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	here , we describe a study that leads to the identification of a novel hla - a*0201-restricted epitope from conserved regions of s protein .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	first , different sars - cov sequences were analyzed to predict eight candidate peptides from conserved regions of the s protein based upon hla - a*0201 binding and proteosomal cleavage .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	four of eight candidate peptides were tested by hla - a*0201 binding assays .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	among the four candidate peptides , sp8 ( s 958 - 966 , vlndilsrl ) induced specific ctls both ex vivo in pbls of healthy hla - a2 + donors and in hla - a2.1 / k b transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding full - length s protein .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	the immunized mice released ifn - γ and lysed target cells upon stimulation with sp8 peptide - pulsed autologous dendritic cells in comparison to other candidates .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	these results suggest that sp8 is a naturally processed epitope .
0ced1f946cce007aa319a0ba38aef2c4b14dab0e	we propose that sp8 epitope should help in the characterization of mechanisms of virus control and immunopathology in sars - cov infection .
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	this study evaluated the efficiency of pediatric mid - turbinate nasal flocked swabs used by parents in 203 children aged 6 months to 5 years with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease .
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	two nasal samples were collected from each child in a randomised sequence : one by a trained pediatrician and one by a parent .
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	the real - time polymerase chain reaction influenza virus detection rates were similar in the samples collected using the two methods ( cohen 's kappa = 0.86 ) , as were the cycle threshold values .
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	in comparison with the pediatrician - collected samples , the sensitivity and specificity of the parental collections were respectively 89.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] : 77.8 - 100 % ) and 97.7 % ( 95 % ci : 95.5 - 100 % ) , and
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 86.2 % ( 95 % ci : 73.7 - 95.1 % ) and 98.2 % ( 95 % ci : 96.4 - 100 % ) .
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	the children were significantly more satisfied with the parental collections ( median values ± standard deviation , 1.59 ± 0.55 vs 3.51 ± 0.36 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	these findings show that mid - turbinate nasal flocked swabs specifically designed for infants and children can be used by parents without reducing the influenza virus detection rate .
0877aadd2c55095b8a663597fbb39150614f335e	moreover , the direct involvement of parents significantly increases patient acceptance , thus simplifying collection and suggesting that this novel swab design should be considered for epidemiological surveys and vaccine efficacy studies .

3db20e37687295cc61a383164929167ec4661989	in the early stages of the pandemic , 84 confusion resulted in some patients self - administering medications with putative benefit to 85 treat the infection and in others , interrupting their prescribed medications for chronic illnesses 86 due to fear of adverse effects , with the potential to cause patient morbidity .
3db20e37687295cc61a383164929167ec4661989	many of these 87 were driven by social media reports advocating positive aspects of some therapies , and 88 negative consequences of on - going administration of others often fueled by misinformation 89 channeled through the covid-19 infodemic(1 - 4 ) .

a1d48eb64fd13e2a1e117a386b81980b4a98430e	different coronavirus e proteins share striking similarities in biochemical properties and biological functions , but seem to adopt distinct membrane topology .
a1d48eb64fd13e2a1e117a386b81980b4a98430e	in this report , we study the membrane topology of the sars - cov e protein by immunofluorescent staining of cells differentially permeabilized with detergents and proteinase k protection assay .
a1d48eb64fd13e2a1e117a386b81980b4a98430e	it was revealed that both the n - and c - termini of the sars - cov e protein are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membranes ( n cyto c cyto ) .
a1d48eb64fd13e2a1e117a386b81980b4a98430e	in contrast , parallel experiments showed that the e protein from infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) spanned the membranes once , with the n - terminus exposed luminally and the c - terminus exposed cytoplasmically

0b694e233e30a6df59c27f0982c5f9126e934926	hence major attention has been focused on characterization of this protein .
0b694e233e30a6df59c27f0982c5f9126e934926	independent studies conducted by several laboratories have elucidated significant insight into the primary function of this protein , which is to encapsidate the viral genome .
0b694e233e30a6df59c27f0982c5f9126e934926	in addition , many reports also suggest that this protein interferes with different cellular pathways , thus implying it to be a key regulatory component of the virus too .
0b694e233e30a6df59c27f0982c5f9126e934926	in the first part of this review , we will discuss these different properties of the n - protein in a consolidated manner .
0b694e233e30a6df59c27f0982c5f9126e934926	further , this protein has also been proposed to be an efficient diagnostic tool and a candidate vaccine against the sars - cov. hence , towards the end of this article , we will discuss some recent progress regarding the possible clinically relevant use of the n - protein .

42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	this paper assesses the age specificity of the infection fatality rate ( ifr ) for covid-19 .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	our benchmark meta - regression synthesizes the age - specific ifrs from four recent large - scale seroprevalence studies conducted in belgium , geneva , spain , and sweden .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	the estimated ifr is close to zero for children and younger adults but rises exponentially with age , reaching about 0.3 percent for ages 50 - 59 , 1 percent for ages 60 - 69 , 4 percent for ages 70 - 79 , and 24 percent for ages 80 and above .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	we compare those predictions to the age - specific ifrs implied by recent seroprevalence studies of six u.s. geographical areas , three small scale studies , and three countries ( iceland , new zealand , and republic of korea ) that have engaged in comprehensive tracking and tracing of covid-19 infections .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	we also review more than 30 other seroprevalence studies whose design was not well - suited for estimating age - specific ifrs .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	our findings indicate that covid-19 is not just dangerous for the elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle - aged adults , for whom the fatality rate is roughly 50 times greater than the risk of dying in an automobile accident .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	consequently , the overall ifr for a given location is intrinsically linked to the age - specific pattern of infections .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	in a scenario where the u.s. infection rate reaches nearly 30 percent , our analysis indicates that protecting vulnerable age groups could prevent over 200,000 deaths .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	objective :
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	determine age - specific infection fatality rates for covid-19 to inform public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	methods :
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	studies of covid-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles , preprints , and government reports identified by online searches .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	a total of 48 studies were identified covering a wide array of locations in advanced economies .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	studies were screened using four specific criteria : (
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	i ) transparency of seroprevalence test characteristics and procedures ; ( ii ) representative sample of the general population ;
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	( iii ) effective pandemic containment by the time of the study ; and ( iv ) reporting of age - specific prevalence and confidence intervals .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	age - specific ifrs were computed using reported fatalities four weeks after the midpoint date of each study , reflecting the typical pattern of lags in fatalities and reporting .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	four studies were identified as benchmarks and used in meta - regression of the infection fatality rate ( ifr ) as a function of age , using the stata metareg procedure .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	the meta - regression results were compared with age - specific ifrs for 12 other locations --an
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	" out - of - sample " exercise that statisticians commonly use in assessing the validity of forecasting models .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	results :
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	our analysis finds a highly significant exponential relationship between age and ifr for covid-19 .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	the estimated age - specific ifrs are close to zero for children and younger adults but rise to about 0.3 percent for ages 50 - 59 , 1 percent for ages 60 - 69 , 4 percent for ages 70 - 79 , and 24 percent for ages 80 and above .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	nearly all of the age - specific ifrs from all 16 studies fall within the 95 % prediction interval of the meta - regression .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	discussion :
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	our analysis indicates that the link between ifr and age is far stronger than the link with comorbidities such as chronic pulmonary disease .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	other recent studies indicate that other characteristics - including race , ethnicity , and socioeconomic status - are not tightly linked to ifr but are strongly tied to infection rates and hence to disparities in mortality outcomes .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	our results clearly indicate that covid-19 is not just dangerous for the elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle - aged adults , for whom the fatality rate is roughly 50 times greater than the risk of dying in an automobile accident .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	furthermore , the overall ifr for covid-19 should not be viewed as an exogenously fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age - specific pattern of infections .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	consequently , individual and collective efforts that minimize infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	in a scenario where the infection rate of the u.s. population reaches nearly 30 % , our analysis indicates that protecting vulnerable age groups could prevent over 200,000 deaths .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	:
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	medrxiv preprint 2 recent meta - analysis noted the high degree of heterogeneity across aggregate estimates of ifr and concluded that research on age - stratified ifr is " urgently needed to inform policymaking . "
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	2
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	in this paper , we consider the hypothesis that the observed variation in ifr across locations may primarily reflect the age specificity of covid-19 infections and fatalities .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	in particular , the overall ifr for a given location can be expressed as follows : =
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	* * using data for n distinct age groups , where denotes the share of age group a in the total population , denotes that age group 's covid-19 infection rate , and denotes that age group 's infection fatality rate .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	demographic information about the age structure for a given location is readily available from census data .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	consequently , a crucial task is to use seroprevalence data to assess age - specific infection rates and ifrs .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	rather than focusing on any single location , we proceed by conducting meta - analysis using data from a wide array of distinct locations , drawn from a total of 48 recent studies of covid-19 prevalence .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	we begin by highlighting key characteristics of studies that are essential for assessing age - specific ifrs , including the use of a broadly representative sample of the general population , seroprevalence methods with high positive predictive power , and tabulation of fatalities that are appropriately linked to the dates of the seroprevalence testing .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	based on those criteria , we exclude 32 other seroprevalence studies that are not suitable for estimating age - specific ifrs .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	using these criteria , we identify four seroprevalence studies that serve as benchmarks : belgium , geneva , spain , and sweden .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	applying meta - regression methods to this set of benchmark studies , we estimate a log - linear relationship between ifr and age and obtain precise coefficients that are not significantly influenced by outliers .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	in particular , the estimated ifr is close to zero for children and younger adults but increases exponentially with age , reaching about 0.5 percent for ages 55 - 64 , 1.6 percent for ages 65 - 74 , and exceeding 6 percent for ages 70 + .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	next , we compare these meta - regression predictions to the age - specific ifrs implied by recent seroprevalence studies of six u.s. geographical areas ( connecticut , south florida , missouri , new york , utah , and puget sound ) as well as three countries ( iceland , korea , and new zealand ) that have engaged in comprehensive tracking and tracing of covid-19 infections .
42873aaa76cca2e380a7f8435081ae75c5406a5c	we also compare these results with three small - scale seroprevalence studies ( castiglione d'adda , gangelt , and the diamond princess cruise ship ) and with the pathbreaking study of that was conducted at a very early stage of the pandemic .

77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	a viruses is known to occur but how viruses interact within co - infection remains unknown .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	an outbreak in a college campus during the 2009 pandemic involved two subtypes of influenza a : persons infected with pandemic a / h1n1 ; persons infected with seasonal a / h3n2 viruses ; and persons infected with both at the same time ( co - infection ) .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	this provides data to analyse the possible interaction between influenza a viruses within co - infection .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	methods :
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	we extend a statistical inference method designed for outbreaks caused by one virus to that caused by two viruses .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	the method uses knowledge of which subtype each case is infected with ( and whether they were co - infected ) , contact information and symptom onset date of each case in the influenza outbreak .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	we then apply it to construct the most likely transmission tree during the outbreak in the college campus .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	results :
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	analysis of the constructed transmission tree shows that the simultaneous presence of the two influenza viruses increases the infectivity and the transmissibility of a / h1n1 virus but whether it changes the infectivity of a / h3n2 is unclear .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	the estimation also shows that co - transmission of both subtypes from co - infection is low and therefore co - infection can not be sustained on its own .
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	conclusions :
77d34e9158807dab65379240836e8a73dd02e2d2	this study suggests that influenza a viruses within co - infected patients can interact in some ways rather than transmit independently , and this can enhance the spread of influenza a virus infection .

97387ea65a5d573778c09417b975ca702d179773	the results indicated that initial trust in mohc context was composed of two interrelated components : health service provider ( doctor ) and underlying technology ( mohc platform ) .
97387ea65a5d573778c09417b975ca702d179773	especially , the initial trust in mohc platform exerted greater effects on adopting intention .
97387ea65a5d573778c09417b975ca702d179773	both performance - based cue ( doctors ' information quality and interaction quality ) and transfer - based cue ( trust in the offline doctors ' health service ) positively shaped the initial trust in doctor .
97387ea65a5d573778c09417b975ca702d179773	meanwhile , only the performance - based cue ( mohc platform 's information quality and service quality ) has significant positive association with initial trust in mohc platform .

9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	we performed an extensive query of the most recent publications addressing the prevention of viral infections including the use of face masks in the community as a method to prevent the spread of the infection .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	we addressed the issues of practicability , professional use , and acceptability based on the community and the environment where the user resided .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	results : upon our critical review of the available literature , we found only weak evidence for wearing a face mask as an efficient hygienic tool to prevent the spread of a viral infection .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	however , the use of mnc seems to be linked to relevant protection during close contact scenarios by limiting pathogen - containing aerosol and liquid droplet dissemination .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	importantly , we found evidence for significant respiratory compromise in patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease , secondary to the development of hypercapnia .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	this could also happen in patients with lung infections , with or without sars - cov-2 .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	epidemiologists currently emphasize that wearing mnc will effectively interrupt airborne infections in the community .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	the government and the politicians have followed these recommendations and used them to both advise and , in some cases , mandate the general population to wear mnc in public locations .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	overall , the results seem to suggest that there are some clinically relevant scenarios where the use of mnc necessitates more defined recommendations .
9d0594bf4c2b4a4cf19cc86630215f0e21bdf335	our critical evaluation of the literature both highlights the protective effects of certain types of face masks in defined risk groups , and emphasizes their potential risks .

07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	with the rapid outbreak of covid-19 , most people are facing antivirus mask shortages .
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	therefore , it is necessary to reasonably select antivirus masks and optimize the use of them for everyone .
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	however , the uncertainty of the effects of covid-19 and limits of human cognition add to the difficulty for decision makers to perfectly realize the purpose .
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	to maximize the utility of the antivirus mask , we proposed a decision support algorithm based on the novel concept of the spherical normal fuzzy ( spnof ) set .
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	in it , firstly , we analyzed the new score and accuracy function , improved operational rules , and their properties .
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	then , in line with these operations , we developed the spnof
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	bonferroni mean operator and the weighted
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	bonferroni mean operator , some properties of which are also examined .
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	furthermore , we established a multi - criteria decision - making method , based on the proposed operators , with spnof information .
07d74ce7ad748f1f680d0a5fb3f9b835f999eac8	finally , a numerical example on antivirus mask selection over the covid-19 pandemic was given to verify the practicability of the proposed method , which the sensitive and comparative analysis was based on and was conducted to demonstrate the availability and superiority of our method .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	the activation of astrocytes and microglia is often associated with diseases of the central nervous system ( cns ) .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	understanding how activation alters
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	the transcriptome of these cells may offer valuable insight regarding how activation of these cells mediate neurological damage .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	furthermore , identifying common and unique pathways of gene expression during activation may provide new insight into the distinct roles these cells have in the cns during infection and inflammation .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	since recent studies indicate that tlr7 recognizes not only viral rna but also micrornas that are released by damaged neurons and elevated during neurological diseases , we first examined the response of glial cells to tlr7 stimulation using microarray analysis .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	microglia were found to generate a much stronger response to tlr7 activation than astrocytes , both in the number of genes induced as well as fold induction .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	although the primary pathways induced by both cell types were directly linked to immune responses , microglia also induced pathways associated with cellular proliferation , while astrocytes did not .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	targeted analysis of a subset of the upregulated genes identified unique mrna , including ifi202b which was only upregulated by microglia and was found to be induced during both retroviral and bunyavirus infections in the cns .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	in addition , other genes including birc3 and gpr84 as well as two expressed sequences aw112010 and bc023105 were found to be induced in both microglia and astrocytes and were upregulated in the cns following virus infection .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	thus , expression of these genes may a useful measurement of glial activation during insult or injury to the cns .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	astrocyte and microglia cultures were prepared from the brain cortex of 1 - 2 day old inbred rocky mountain white ( irw ) mice as previously described [ 20 ] .
6e94aa9c37dd7be5b553090717c59992005d114b	in brief , brain tissue was removed from multiple animals at 2 days of age and placed in ice cold phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) .

be4f7c9109a242bfea7c73dbb551238cf598e690	attenuated measles virus ( mv ) is one of the most effective and safe vaccines available , making it attractive candidate vector to prevent infectious diseases .
be4f7c9109a242bfea7c73dbb551238cf598e690	attenuated mv have acquired the ability to use the complement regulator cd46 as a major receptor to mediate virus entry and intercellular fusion .
be4f7c9109a242bfea7c73dbb551238cf598e690	therefore , attenuated mv strains preferentially infect and destroy a wide variety of cancer cells making them also attractive oncolytic vectors .
be4f7c9109a242bfea7c73dbb551238cf598e690	the use of recombinant mv vector has to comply with various regulatory requirements , particularly relating to the assessment of potential risks for human health and the environment .
be4f7c9109a242bfea7c73dbb551238cf598e690	the present article highlights the main characteristics of mv and recombinant mv vectors used for vaccination and virotherapy and discusses these features from a biosafety point of view .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	influenza pandemics have been amongst the largest and the deadliest epidemics in the history of man , and were observed already in ancient times .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	for example , records from the fifth century b.c. suggest that influenza pandemics were observed in ancient greece .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	in europe , during the middle ages and the renaissance , numerous concordant reports from different countries describe epidemics of respiratory infections that resemble influenza pandemics .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	however , it is not possible to be certain that these epidemics were due to influenza .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	in the twentieth century , three influenza pandemics have occurred , including the deadly spanish flu pandemic .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	modern virology has unravelled the mechanisms of emergence of pandemic viruses , and considerable knowledge on influenza viruses has been accumulated .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	the picture is now clear : influenza a is a zoonotic virus whose reservoir is in wild birds .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	in rare cases , these avian viruses are introduced into man and , eventually , become pandemic viruses .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	although these mechanisms are now understood , the time frame required for adaptation of the avian virus to its new host remains unknown .
90a60b5837824cdb8dac89667c63533fde256318	maybe the next pandemic will show us how rapid this adaptation can be .

edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	using genetically diverse animals from incipient lines of the collaborative cross mouse panel , we demonstrate a greatly expanded range of phenotypes relative to classical mouse models of sars - cov infection including lung pathology , weight loss and viral titer .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	genetic mapping revealed several loci contributing to differential disease responses , including an 8.5mb locus associated with vascular cuffing on chromosome 3 that contained 23 genes and 13 noncoding rnas .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	integrating phenotypic and genetic data narrowed this region to a single gene , trim55 , an e3 ubiquitin ligase with a role in muscle fiber maintenance .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	lung pathology and transcriptomic data from mice genetically deficient in trim55 were used to validate its role in sars - cov - induced vascular cuffing and inflammation .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	these data establish the collaborative cross platform as a powerful genetic resource for uncovering genetic contributions of complex traits in microbial disease severity , inflammation and virus replication in models of outbred populations .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	new emerging pathogens are a significant threat to human health with at least six highly pathogenic viruses , including four respiratory viruses , having spread from animal hosts into the human population within the past 15 years .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	with the emergence of new pathogens , new and better animal models are needed in order to better understand the disease these pathogens cause ; to assist in the rapid development of therapeutics ; and importantly to evaluate the role of natural host genetic variation in regulating disease outcome .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	we used incipient lines of the collaborative cross , a newly available recombinant inbred mouse panel , to identify polymorphic host genes that contribute to sars - cov pathogenesis .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	we discovered new animal models that better capture the range of disease found in human sars patients and also found four novel susceptibility loci governing various aspects of sars - induced pathogenesis .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	by integrating statistical , genetic and bioinformatic approaches we were able to narrow candidate genome regions to highly likely candidate genes .
edea2cda674c33bb251b64e5416f5380f13d5489	we narrowed one locus to a single candidate gene , trim55 , and confirmed its role in the inflammatory response to sars - cov infection through the use of knockout mice .

6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	background :
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	this study examined the effectiveness of a theoretical framework that integrates self - determination theory ( sdt ) and the theory of planned behavior ( tpb ) in explaining the use of facemasks to prevent seasonal influenza among hong kong older adults .
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	methods :
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	data were collected at two time points in the winter in hong kong , during which influenza is most prevalent .
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	at time 1 , older adults ( n = 141 ) completed self - report measures of sdt ( perceived autonomy support from senior center staff , autonomous motivation for influenza prevention ) and tpb ( attitude , subjective norm , perceived behavioral control , and intention for influenza prevention ) constructs with respect to facemask used to prevent infection .
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	two weeks later , at time 2 , participants ' acceptance of a facemask to prevent influenza in the presence of an experimenter with flu - like symptoms was recorded .
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	results :
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	path analysis found that perceived autonomy support of senior center staff was positively and significantly linked to autonomous motivation for facemask use , which , in turn , was positively related to intentions to wear facemasks through the mediation of attitude , subjective norm , and perceived behavioral control .
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	however , the effect of intention on facemask use was not significant .
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	conclusions :
6f95128d6a8899b5c90dc234a613d4b08415a9e2	results generally support the proposed framework and the findings of previous studies with respect to intention , but the non - significant intention - behavior relationship may warrant future research to examine the reasons for older adults not to wear facemasks to prevent seasonal influenza despite having positive intentions to do so .

534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	the 18 objective of this study was to assess the detection of influenza d virus ( idv ) in bovine 19 respiratory tract samples using two sequencing platforms ( miseq and nanopore 20 ( gridion ) ) , and species - specific qpcr .
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	an idv - specific qpcr was performed on 232 21 samples ( 116 nasal swabs and 116 tracheal washes ) that had been previously subject to 22 virome sequencing using miseq .
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	nanopore sequencing was performed on 19 samples 23 positive for idv by either miseq or qpcr .
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	nanopore sequence data was analyzed by two 24 bioinformatics methods :
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	what 's in my pot ( wimp , on the epi2me platform ) , and an in-25 house developed analysis pipeline .
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	the agreement of idv detection between qpcr and 26 miseq was 82.3 % , between
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	qpcr and nanopore was 57.9 % ( in - house ) and 84.2 % 27 ( wimp ) , and between miseq and nanopore
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	was 89.5 % ( in - house ) and 73.7 % ( wimp ) .
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	28 idv was detected by miseq in 14 of 17 idv qpcr - positive samples with cq ( cycle 29 quantification ) values below 31 , despite multiplexing 50 samples for sequencing .
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	when 30 qpcr was regarded as the gold standard , the sensitivity and specificity of miseq sequence 31 detection were 28.3 % and 98.9 % , respectively .
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	we conclude that both miseq and 32 nanopore sequencing are capable of detecting idv in clinical specimens with a range of cq 33 values .
534fc35dc4c2f25946659137a8ab95cfce643837	sensitivity may be further improved by optimizing sequence data analysis , 34 improving virus enrichment , or reducing the degree of multiplexing .

09b1afa1b6bc043468461b28700c0272eaedc96d	transportation investment continues to grow in aid of economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability worldwide , but limited empirical research has been conducted on the changing value of highway investment in deindustrializing economies .
09b1afa1b6bc043468461b28700c0272eaedc96d	this study examines the influences of highway proximity and traffic on office values in hong kong using hedonic price analysis on 13,670 transactions around highway interchanges for 2002 - 2013 .
09b1afa1b6bc043468461b28700c0272eaedc96d	our hedonic regressions , controlling for unobservable district effects and incorporating instrumental variables , reveal that the associations of highway proximity and traffic with office prices appear to exhibit mixed results across hong kong 's three territorial divisions .
09b1afa1b6bc043468461b28700c0272eaedc96d	the negative externalities generated by excess traffic cancel out the accessibility benefits of highway proximity on hong kong island , where densely built - up office districts are suited for amenity - sensitive knowledge businesses that tend to create value - added services through face - to - face communications .
09b1afa1b6bc043468461b28700c0272eaedc96d	by contrast , highway proximity uplifts the value of office properties with lower transportation costs and higher market accessibility in kowloon and the new territories , where spacious workplaces near hub - port and logistics facilities are advantageous for mobility - driven trade and transportation businesses that tend to increase value - added throughput in cross - border relations with mainland china .
09b1afa1b6bc043468461b28700c0272eaedc96d	these territorial findings are of particular importance for progressive policymakers to deploy the strategic applications of underground bypasses , greenway creation , interchange improvement , congestion charges , and smart technology to manage mobility and alleviate disamenity , accompanied by supportive public transit services and adaptive land - use rezoning , in the dynamic and complex process of deindustrialization .
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	in previous work , we demonstrated that the arenavirus junín virus ( junv ) is able to activate akt by means of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( pi3 k ) survival pathway during virus entry .
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	this work extends our study , emphasizing the relevance of this pathway in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infection in vitro .
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	during the course of infection , junv - infected vero cells showed a typical cytopathic effect that may be ascribed to apoptotic cell death .
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	treatment of infected cultures with ly294002 , an inhibitor of the pi3k / akt pathway , produced an apoptotic response similar to that observed for uninfected cells treated with the drug .
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	this result suggests that virus - induced activation of the pi3k / akt pathway does not deliver a strong enough anti - apoptotic signal to explain the low proportion of apoptotic cells observed during infection .
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	also , inhibition of the pi3k / akt pathway during the acute stage of infection did not prevent the establishment of persistence .
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	furthermore , treatment of persistently junvinfected cells with ly294002 did not alter viral protein expression .
d6580eec2b617690edcfa198a093c98bffdb33a2	these findings indicate that despite the positive modulation of the pi3 / akt pathway during junín virus entry , this would not play a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of junv persistence in vero cells .
20029dc39eb2b7cd0a8392445e6596f93933258a	there have been many attempts to isolate infectious agents from patients with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , and many viruses have been incriminated at one time or another over the past few decades .

20029dc39eb2b7cd0a8392445e6596f93933258a	thus , we cautiously report on the isolation of four antigenically related agents from the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) of three patients with ms and one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .
20029dc39eb2b7cd0a8392445e6596f93933258a	the patients yielding the isolates from their csf possessed neutralizing antibodies to the virus in their blood , in contrast to several other virus - free patients with chronic central nervous system ( cns ) diseases studied at the same time .

d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	this study was to determine if feline immunodeficiency virus ( fiv)-infected and uninfected crandall feline kidney ( crfk ) cells exhibited a low temperature ( 16~ block in membrane trafficking between transitional endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus represented by intermediate compartment formation .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	ceils were cultured at different temperatures and membrane changes involving the golgi apparatus and golgi apparatus - associated membrane structures were monitored by electron microscopy and quantitated .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	with 30 min of incubation , membranes of the golgi apparatus stack increased in amount at temperatures of 16 ~ and below compared to temperatures above 18 ~
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	the increase was greatest along the major polarity axis as evidenced by an increased stack height .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	neither the number of cisternae per stack nor the average stack diameter ( width ) was affected by temperature .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	the response was maximal between 15 and 30 rain of low temperature treatment of the cells .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	results with cells infected and uninfected with feline immunodeficiency virus were similar .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	the increase in stack height was due primarily to an increase of membranes at the cis face ( cis golgi apparatus network ) .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	at 18 ~ membranes of the trans golgi apparatus network accumulated suggesting that import from the cis golgi network could proceed at this temperature , whereas exit from the trans golgi network was still at least partially blocked .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	also increased at 16 ~ and below were numbers of transition vesicles in the space between the golgi apparatus and the transitional endoplasmic reticulum associated with the cis golgi apparatus face .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	the results suggested interruption of the orderly flux of membranes into the golgi apparatus at 16~ and below .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	moreover , the block appeared to be reversible .
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	upon transfer from 16~ to 37~ there was a time - dependent decrease in the accumulations of cis compartment membrane accompanied by a corresponding equivalent increase in the membranes of the trans golgi apparatus compartment .
97573bdfc3c350c86a74c95ea11e773fbb12786b	the global boom in premature mortality and morbidity from noncommunicable diseases ( ncds ) shares many similarities with pandemics of infectious diseases , yet public health professionals have resisted the adoption of this label .
97573bdfc3c350c86a74c95ea11e773fbb12786b	it is increasingly apparent that ncds are actually communicable conditions , and although the vectors of disease are nontraditional , the pandemic label is apt .
97573bdfc3c350c86a74c95ea11e773fbb12786b	arguing for a change in terminology extends beyond pedantry as the move carries serious implications for the public health community and the general public .
97573bdfc3c350c86a74c95ea11e773fbb12786b	additional resources are unlocked once a disease reaches pandemic proportions and , as a long - neglected and underfunded group of conditions , ncds desperately require a renewed sense of focus and political attention .
97573bdfc3c350c86a74c95ea11e773fbb12786b	this paper provides objections , definitions , and advantages to approaching the leading cause of global death through an alternative lens .

3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	study was conducted at four tertiary private hospitals located in two cities in saudi arabia .
3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	adult inpatients were enrolled under the pre - ams arm and post - ams arm if they were on any of the ten selected restricted broad - spectrum antibiotics ( imipenem / cilastatin , piperacillin / tazobactam , colistin , tigecycline , cefepime , meropenem , ciprofloxacin , moxifloxacin , teicoplanin and linezolid ) .
3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	results :
3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	a total of 409,403 subjects were recruited , 79,369 in the pre - ams control and 330,034 in the post - ams arm .

3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	antimicrobial expenditures decreased by 28.45 % in the first year of the program and remained relatively stable in subsequent years , with overall cumulative cost savings estimated at s.r. 6,286,929 and negligible expenses of s.r. 505,115 ( p = 0.648 ) .
3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	rates of healthcare associated infections involving c. difficile , vap , and clabsi all decreased significantly after ams implementation ( incidence of hais in 2015 compared to 2019 : for c. difficile , 94 vs 13 , p = 0.024 ; for vap , 24 vs 6 , p = 0.001 ; for clabsi , 17 vs 1 , p = 0.000 ; respectively ) .
3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	conclusion :
3a474a2b6ba4b6a4e71a34c326bcbc2236e25457	implementation of ams program at hmg healthcare facilities resulted in reduced antimicrobials use and cost , and lowered incidence of healthcare associated infections .

e9c8c9036e9dd48230c81ff006be5fceba73660f	serotype 19a is not covered by the 7-or 10-valent pneumococcal vaccines .
e9c8c9036e9dd48230c81ff006be5fceba73660f	mycoplasma pneumoniae and metapneumovirus were simultaneously detected by pcr in the nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates .
e9c8c9036e9dd48230c81ff006be5fceba73660f	the pneumococcus is penicillin sensitive .
e9c8c9036e9dd48230c81ff006be5fceba73660f	although infections with each of these pathogens alone are typically mild , this case highlights that co - infection with the triple respiratory pathogens possibly contributed to the fatal outcome of this child .

b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	mouse hepatitis virus persists in cultures of a subline ( designated lm - k ) of mouse lm cells but produces a lytic infection in l-2 cells .
b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	persistence in the lm - k cells was not accompanied by production of ts mutants or of soluble anti - mhv factors .
b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by mhv of the lm - k cells as compared to l-2 cells .
b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	on an infected cell basis , production levels of infectious progeny and viral rna were comparable between the two cell lines .
b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	the extent of virusinduced cell - cell fusion , however , was markedly reduced in the lm - k cells .
b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	cell - mixing experiments showed that both infected l-2 and lm - k cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected l-2 cells but not with uninfected lm - k cells .
b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	this suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the lm - k infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface , but rather to an inherent resistance of the lm - k cell membrane to mhv - induced fusion .
b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651	it is believed that such fusion resistance in lm - k cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture , thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence .
7d249d30e5fed3a63e86f598a24e5beeae5317ac	motivated by the current covid-19 health - crisis , we examine the task of baseline subtraction for quantitative polymerase chain - reaction ( qpcr ) measurements .
7d249d30e5fed3a63e86f598a24e5beeae5317ac	in particular , we present an algorithm that leverages information obtained from non - template and/or dna extraction - control experiments to remove systematic bias from amplification curves .
7d249d30e5fed3a63e86f598a24e5beeae5317ac	we recast this problem in terms of mathematical optimization , i.e. by finding the amount of control signal that , when subtracted from an amplification curve , minimizes background noise .
7d249d30e5fed3a63e86f598a24e5beeae5317ac	we demonstrate that this approach can yield a decade improvement in sensitivity relative to standard approaches , especially for data exhibiting late - cycle amplification .
7d249d30e5fed3a63e86f598a24e5beeae5317ac	critically , this increased sensitivity and accuracy promises more effective screening of viral dna and a reduction in the rate of false - negatives in diagnostic settings .

21d19c09d38d83036d23288d2f7c0ea8dc2ede13	in situ hybridization ( ish ) is a useful diagnostic and research tool , but is also time consuming .
21d19c09d38d83036d23288d2f7c0ea8dc2ede13	this study was conducted to determine if a rate enhancement hybridization ( reh ) buffer , developed for membrane hybridization , could be used to decrease hybridization time for ish .

21d19c09d38d83036d23288d2f7c0ea8dc2ede13	viral rna was detected in intestines from as early as 30 min of hybridization by using both buffers with the radiolabelled probe ; however , the signal was stronger with the reh buffer .
21d19c09d38d83036d23288d2f7c0ea8dc2ede13	with the fluorescein - labelled probe , viral rna was detected in virus - infected cells of the intestines after 30 min of hybridization by using the reh buffer .

7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	children infected with mtb are more likely to progress to active tb ( atb ) ; however , the molecular mechanism behind this process has long been a mystery .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	we employed the label - free quantitative proteomic technology to identify and characterize differences in plasma proteins between atb and latent tb infection ( ltbi ) in children .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	to detect differences that are indicative of mtb infection , we first selected proteins whose expressions were markedly different between the atb and ltbi groups and the control groups ( inflammatory disease control ( idc ) and healthy control ( hc ) groups ) .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	a total of 521 proteins differed ( > 1.5-fold or < 0.6-fold ) in the ltbi group , and 318 proteins in the atb group when compared with the control groups .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	of these , 49 overlapping proteins were differentially expressed between ltbi and atb .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	gene ontology ( go ) analysis revealed most proteins had a cellular and organelle distribution .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	the mtb infection status was mainly related to differences in binding , cellular and metabolic processes .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	xrcc4 , pcf11 , sema4a and atp11a were selected and further verified by qpcr and western blot .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	at the mrna level , the expression of xrcc4 , pcf11and sema4a presented an increased trend in atb group compare with ltbi .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	at the protein level , the expression of all these proteins by western blot in atb / ltbi was consistent with the trends from proteomic detection .
7da4fcd53b89c33706e7e63f8b2f527f27f07ef8	our results provide important data for future mechanism studies and biomarker selection for mtb infection in children .

2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	to date , more than 2300 cases have been reported , with an approximate case fatality rate of 35 % .
2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	epidemiological investigations identified dromedary camels as the source of mers - cov zoonotic transmission and evidence of mers - cov circulation has been observed throughout the original range of distribution .
2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	other new - world camelids , alpacas and llamas , are also susceptible to mers - cov infection .
2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	currently , it is unknown whether bactrian camels are susceptible to infection .
2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	the distribution of bactrian camels overlaps partly with that of the dromedary camel in west and central asia .
2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	the receptor for mers - cov , dpp4 , of the bactrian camel was 98.3 % identical to the dromedary camel dpp4 , and 100 % identical for the 14 residues which interact with the mers - cov spike receptor .
2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	upon intranasal inoculation with 107 plaque - forming units of mers - cov , animals developed a transient , primarily upper respiratory tract infection .
2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	clinical signs of the mers - cov infection were benign , but shedding of large quantities of mers - cov from the urt was observed .
2d73c30f41bb0fd24d5ddf1e71a472d971ce4d6f	these data are similar to infections reported with dromedary camel infections and indicate that bactrians are susceptible to mers - cov and given their overlapping range are at risk of introduction and establishment of mers - cov within the bactrian camel populations .

a1fbe97ec8521ddb7624d7f2b2901d7eed813838	sars - cov-2 testing is well recognized , but it will be equally necessary to develop quantitative methods that determine viral load in order to guide patient triage and medical decision making .
a1fbe97ec8521ddb7624d7f2b2901d7eed813838	we are the first to report that sars - cov-2 viral load at the time of presentation is an independent predictor of covid-19 mortality in a large patient cohort ( n=1,145 ) .
a1fbe97ec8521ddb7624d7f2b2901d7eed813838	viral loads should be used to identify higher - risk patients that may require more aggressive care and should be included as a key biomarker in the development of predictive algorithms .

b0cae19606cad103f0faadf98436fcbdbf95282e	this paper presents a theoretical research about the relationship between weak negations and adjoint negations .
b0cae19606cad103f0faadf98436fcbdbf95282e	adjoint negations are a generalization of residuated negations built from the implications of an adjoint triple .
b0cae19606cad103f0faadf98436fcbdbf95282e	specifically , this work shows how to build adjoint triples on the unit interval such that their adjoint negations coincide with a given weak negation .
b0cae19606cad103f0faadf98436fcbdbf95282e	moreover , the algebraic structure formed by these adjoint triples is also investigated .

6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	human respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is a common viral pathogen that causes lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children globally .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	in this study , we developed a duplex reverse transcription recombinase - aided amplification ( duplex - rtraa ) assay containing an internal control in a single closed tube for the detection of human rsv .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	the internal control in the amplification effectively eliminated false - negative results and ensured the accuracy of the duplex - rtraa system .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	we first developed and evaluated a universal singleplex - rtraa assay for rsv .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	the sensitivity of this assay for rsv was determined as 4.4 copies per reaction , and the specificity was 100 % .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	next , a duplex - rtraa assay with an internal control was established .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	the sensitivity of the duplex - rtraa assay approached 5.0 copies per reaction , and no cross - reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	the two detection methods ( singleplex - rtraa and duplex - rtraa ) developed in this study were used to test 278 clinical specimens , and the results showed absolute consistency with rsv rt - qpcr analysis , demonstrating 100 % diagnostic sensitivity and specificity .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	these data indicate that the duplex - rtraa has great potential for the rapid detection of rsv with a high sensitivity .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	acute respiratory tract infections ( artis ) are one of the main causes of outpatient visits , hospitalization , and death , especially in children , the elderly and immunocompromised individuals [ 1 - 3 ] .
6ca3f120df064f4cf573e1d8d60ee81cd1ed68e7	the major pathogens causing artis in infants and young children are viruses , the most frequently reported of which include respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) ,
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	in addition to top - down health - emergency and disaster risk management ( health - edrm ) efforts , bottom - up individual and household measures are crucial for prevention and emergency response of the covid-19 pandemic , a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) .
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	there is limited scientific evidence of the knowledge , perception , attitude and behavior patterns of the urban population .
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	a computerized randomized digital dialing , cross - sectional , population landline - based telephone survey was conducted from 22 march to 1 april 2020 in hong kong special administrative region , china .
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	data were collected for socio - demographic characteristics , knowledge , attitude and risk perception , and various self - reported health - edrm behavior patterns associated with covid-19 .
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	the final study sample was 765 .
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	although the respondents thought that individuals ( 68.6 % ) had similar responsibilities as government ( 67.5 % ) in infection control , less than 50 % had sufficient health risk management knowledge to safeguard health and well - being .
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	among the examined health - edrm measures , significant differences were found between attitude and practice in regards to washing hands with soap , ordering takeaways , wearing masks , avoidance of visiting public places or using public transport , and travel avoidance to covid-19-confirmed regions .
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	logistic regression indicated that the elderly were less likely to worry about infection with covid-19 .
d2e547f12f4013f19fd37be883e7e72e67adc453	compared to personal and household hygiene practices , lower compliance was found for public social distancing .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	objective :
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	responding to the covid-19 pandemic requires accurate forecasting of health system capacity requirements using readily available inputs .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	we examined whether testing and hospitalization data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter - in - place ( sip ) order .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	materials and methods : 16,103 sars - cov-2 rt - pcr tests were performed on 15,807 patients at stanford facilities between march 2 and april 11 , 2020 .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	we analyzed the fraction of tested patients that were confirmed positive for covid-19 , the fraction of those needing hospitalization , and the fraction requiring icu admission over the 40 days between march 2nd and april 11th 2020 .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	results :
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	we find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of sip even as cases continued to rise .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	we also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those testing positive for covid-19 over the four weeks of sip .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	the impact of this shift is a divergence between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations , both of which affects the demand on health systems .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	conclusion :
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients , current models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of covid-19 .
222ede4b0bb4470c4f867003cd333918665443a5	it is imperative that health systems start using these data to quantify effects of sip and aid reopening planning .
121d9f9639fe01021279fbbe0980fe358e99d10b	the baculovirus expression system ( bes ) has been one of the versatile platforms for the production of recombinant proteins requiring multiple post - translational modifications , such as folding , oligomerization , phosphorylation , glycosylation , acylation , disulfide bond formation and proteolytic cleavage .
121d9f9639fe01021279fbbe0980fe358e99d10b	advances in recombinant dna technology have facilitated application of the bes , and made it possible to express multiple proteins simultaneously in a single infection and to produce multimeric proteins sharing functional similarity with their natural analogs .
121d9f9639fe01021279fbbe0980fe358e99d10b	therefore , the bes has been used for the production of recombinant proteins and the construction of virus - like particles ( vlps ) , as well as for the development of subunit vaccines , including vlp - based vaccines .
121d9f9639fe01021279fbbe0980fe358e99d10b	the vlp , which consists of one or more structural proteins but no viral genome , resembles the authentic virion but can not replicate in cells .
121d9f9639fe01021279fbbe0980fe358e99d10b	the high - quality recombinant protein expression and post - translational modifications obtained with the bes , along with its capacity to produce multiple proteins , imply that it is ideally suited to vlp production .
121d9f9639fe01021279fbbe0980fe358e99d10b	in this article , we critically review the pros and cons of using the bes as a platform to produce both enveloped and non - enveloped vlps .

cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	the pandemic caused by coronavirus in recent months is having a devastating global effect , which puts the world under the most ever unprecedented emergency .
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	currently , since there are not effective antiviral treatments for covid-19 yet , it is crucial to early detect and monitor the progression of the disease , thus helping to reduce mortality .
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	while a corresponding vaccine is being developed , and different measures are being used to combat the virus , medical imaging techniques have also been investigated to assist doctors in diagnosing this disease .
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	objective :
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	this paper presents a practical solution for the detection of
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	covid-19 from chest x - ray ( cxr ) images , exploiting cutting - edge machine learning techniques .
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	methods :
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	we employ efficientnet and mixnet , two recently developed families of deep neural networks , as the main classification engine .
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	furthermore , we also apply different transfer learning strategies , aiming at making the training process more accurate and efficient .
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	the proposed approach has been validated by means of two real datasets , the former consists of 13,511 training images and 1,489 testing images , the latter has 14,324 and 3,581 images for training and testing , respectively .
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	results :
cf02eda4abb178855765e26cc753a82ed247968e	the results are promising : by all the experimental configurations considered in the evaluation ,
fa65bb35e6197c892d8866d347aed54859fbd2db	to gain a better understanding of the replication , proliferation and infection characteristics of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) in porcine intestinal epithelial cells ( iecs ) , this study established a cell model of iecs infected with the chongqing ( cq ) strain of tgev .
fa65bb35e6197c892d8866d347aed54859fbd2db	the morphogenesis and proliferative rule of tgev in porcine iecs were investigated using transmission electron microscopy , indirect immunofluorescence assays and real - time fluorescence quantitative pcr .
fa65bb35e6197c892d8866d347aed54859fbd2db	observations under the tem indicated that the enveloped viral particles were roughly spherical , with diameters of between 80 and 120 nm .
fa65bb35e6197c892d8866d347aed54859fbd2db	the virions entered porcine iecs by membrane fusion and the mature viruses in the vacuoles were transported to the cell membrane before release .
fa65bb35e6197c892d8866d347aed54859fbd2db	the results also showed that from 0 to 12 h after tgev infection of porcine iecs , the intracellular viral rna content did not change significantly .
fa65bb35e6197c892d8866d347aed54859fbd2db	logarithmic growth occurred from 12 to 36 h , after which it gradually decreased .
fa65bb35e6197c892d8866d347aed54859fbd2db	moreover , the extracellular rna content began to rise at 24 h after inoculation and then reduced gradually at approximately 48 h. this study provided a theoretical foundation for further study on the infection characteristics of tgev in target cells .
c676bba1ba39876fe5f57c24dba295d3d8050f11	covid-19 outbreak is still threatening the public health .
c676bba1ba39876fe5f57c24dba295d3d8050f11	therefore , in the middle of the pandemic , all kind of knowledge on sars - cov-2 may help us to find the solution .
c676bba1ba39876fe5f57c24dba295d3d8050f11	determining the 3d structures of the proteins involved in host - pathogen interactions are of great importance in the fight against infection .
c676bba1ba39876fe5f57c24dba295d3d8050f11	besides , post - translational modifications of the protein on 3d structure should be revealed in order to understand the protein function since these modifications are responsible for the host - pathogen interaction .
c676bba1ba39876fe5f57c24dba295d3d8050f11	based on these , we predicted o - glycosylation and phosphorylation positions using full amino acid sequence of s1 protein .
c676bba1ba39876fe5f57c24dba295d3d8050f11	candidate positions were further analyzed with enzyme binding activity , solvent accessibility , surface area parameters and the positions determined with high accuracy rate were used to design full 3d glycoprotein structure of the s1 protein using carbohydrate force field .
c676bba1ba39876fe5f57c24dba295d3d8050f11	in addition , the interaction between the c - type lectin cd209l and α -mannose residues was examined and carbohydrate recognition positions were predicted .
c676bba1ba39876fe5f57c24dba295d3d8050f11	we suggest these positions as a potential target for the inhibition of the initial binding of sars - cov-2 s1 protein to the host cell .
27fbfb693135818f95a81d461b54d2d3a359ab1e	much evidence supports the notion that angiotensin ii ( ang ii ) , the central product of the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) , may play a central role not only in the etiology of hypertension but also in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases in humans .
27fbfb693135818f95a81d461b54d2d3a359ab1e	ang ii , via the ang ii type 1 receptor , directly causes cellular phenotypic changes and cell growth , regulates the gene expression of various bioactive substances , and activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts , as well as vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells .
27fbfb693135818f95a81d461b54d2d3a359ab1e	recently , new factors have been discovered , such as angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 , angiotensin-(1 - 7 ) , and its receptor mas .

58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	objectives :
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	calcium channel blockers are highly protein - bound medications frequently used in the management of hypertension .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	overdose results in severe hypotension and is the fourth most common cause of toxicity - related deaths in the united states .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	management is mostly supportive , with currently no standard role for targeted drug removal .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	the protein - bound nature of these medications presents the option of utilizing albumin dialysis for their removal and for the reversal of associated shock .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	design and subjects : we present two cases of life - threatening intentional amlodipine overdoses successfully treated with albumin dialysis .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	both patients experienced profound distributive shock in the setting of preserved cardiac contractility that was refractory to maximal vasoactive agent support .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	interventions and results : after initiation of albumin dialysis , the patients showed rapid hemodynamic improvement and were able to be weaned off vasopressor support .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	conclusions :
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	these cases demonstrate the safety and efficacy of albumin dialysis in the management of near - fatal calcium channel blocker overdoses related to amlodipine and offer an additional therapeutic option apart from conventional supportive care .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	importantly , these cases were not associated with impaired cardiac contractility , thereby making venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a less preferable option .
58935b198ceed267c568c49bc1303a3b629a544e	furthermore , this therapeutic benefit of albumin dialysis can potentially be extended to the management of toxicity related to other highly protein - bound drugs and toxins .
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	as an emerging infectious disease , the 2019 coronavirus disease has developed into a global pandemic .
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	during the initial spreading of the virus in china , we demonstrated the ensemble kalman filter performed well as a short - term predictor of the daily cases reported in wuhan city .
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	second , we used an individual - level network - based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in hubei province and examine the effectiveness of non - pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios .
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	our simulation results show that without continued control measures , the epidemic in hubei province could have become persistent .
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1 ) protective measures and 2 )
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in hubei province be reconstructed in simulation .
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	finally , we simulate the covid-19 transmission with non - markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories , compared to those obtained with markov processes .
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	since recent studies show that covid-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to markov processes , future works need to focus on non - markovian models to better capture the covid-19 spreading trajectories .
2e32a4c99ae1609a98094a4b814592bbd73a7e26	in addition , shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly .
3d8ecb8a971ade120ad011b3e1d93d588d2ae81a	we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different backends of the prob constraint solver .
3d8ecb8a971ade120ad011b3e1d93d588d2ae81a	for this , we train a random forest over a database of constraints to classify whether a backend is able to find a solution within a given amount of time or answers unknown .
3d8ecb8a971ade120ad011b3e1d93d588d2ae81a	the forest is then analysed in regards of feature importances to determine subsets of the b language in which the respective backends excel or lack for performance .
3d8ecb8a971ade120ad011b3e1d93d588d2ae81a	the results are compared to our initial assumptions over each backend 's performance in these subsets based on personal experiences .
3d8ecb8a971ade120ad011b3e1d93d588d2ae81a	while we do employ classifiers , we do not aim for a good predictor , but are rather interested in analysis of the classifier 's learned knowledge over the utilised b constraints .
3d8ecb8a971ade120ad011b3e1d93d588d2ae81a	the aim is to strengthen our knowledge of the different tools at hand by finding subsets of the b language in which a backend performs better than others .

84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	during neurotropic coronavirus virus ( jhmv ) induced encephalomyelitis , mmp9 activity is restricted to neutrophils .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	furthermore , myeloid cell depletion implicated mmp9 in facilitating leukocyte central nervous system ( cns ) infiltration via loss of bbb integrity .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	the requirement of mmp9 in bbb disruption was thus assessed in jhmv infected mmp9 deficient ( mmp9 −/− ) mice .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	depletion of neutrophils reduced cns accumulation of monocytes and t cells , albeit without affecting overall pathogenesis .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	by contrast , infected mmp9 −/− mice revealed no differences in cns leukocyte infiltration , composition or localization , consistent with bbb disruption similar to wild type ( wt ) mice .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	unimpaired t cell mediated virus control supported an unexpectedly redundant role of mmp9 in promoting leukocyte access to the brain parenchyma .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	while mmp9 deficiency did not expand the overall limited pattern of mmp expression during jhmv infection , it coincided with mmp3 upregulation .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	mmp3 expression remained largely confined to astrocytes , similar to wt mice .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	these data demonstrate that neutrophil - derived mmp9 is not the sole mediator facilitating parenchymal leukocyte entry via bbb disruption during viral encephalomyelitis .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	moreover , significantly enhanced mmp3 expression by astrocytes in infected mmp9 −/−
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	mice suggests an active role of resident cells in participating and potentially collaborating with infiltrating cells in regulating bbb permeability .
84c9884639d81639d6ee925ab67404c88885a270	overall , these results highlight the complexity of targeting individual mmps as a strategy to regulate inflammation .

8dffc4c34ac1c81eeaee40288b4ee1845b29b373	thus , in 51 cases ( 61.4 % ) of all epidemics , the following viruses were responsible for an epidemic :

1c2cf112f9aee64dae0b6e09be44c367cdede066	we characterize the distribution of risk for covid-19 mortality for populations at large across 442 us cities , by utilizing recently published estimates of risk associated with age , gender , ethnicity , social deprivation and 12 health conditions from a very large uk - based study , combined with the information available on prevalence and co - occurrence of these factors in the us through a variety of population - based public databases .
1c2cf112f9aee64dae0b6e09be44c367cdede066	we estimate that across all the cities , an underlying weighted risk - score can identify a total of approximately 12.65 million , 4.09 million and 1.34 million individuals who are at 2- , 5-and 10-fold higher risk , respectively , compared to the average risk for the us population .
1c2cf112f9aee64dae0b6e09be44c367cdede066	the percentage of population which exceed the respective risk thresholds varies across the cities in the range ( 1 st -99 th percentile ) , 3.6%-20.1 % , 0.7%-8.0 % and 0.1%-3.2 % , respectively .

93d1f32b5ded4a2dfc0615e44a714af19ce11942	we therefore compared the functional properties of the s proteins with aspartic acid ( s d614 ) and glycine ( s g614 ) at residue 614 .
93d1f32b5ded4a2dfc0615e44a714af19ce11942	we observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with s g614 infected ace2expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with s d614 .
93d1f32b5ded4a2dfc0615e44a714af19ce11942	this greater infectivity was correlated with less s1 shedding and greater incorporation of the s protein into the pseudovirion .
93d1f32b5ded4a2dfc0615e44a714af19ce11942	similar results were obtained using the virus - like particles produced with sars - cov-2 m , n , e , and s proteins .
93d1f32b5ded4a2dfc0615e44a714af19ce11942	however , s g614 did not bind ace2 more efficiently than s d614 , and the pseudoviruses containing these s proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma .
93d1f32b5ded4a2dfc0615e44a714af19ce11942	these results show s g614 is more stable than s d614 , consistent with epidemiological data suggesting that viruses with s g614 transmit more efficiently .
93d1f32b5ded4a2dfc0615e44a714af19ce11942	until late 2019 , only six coronaviruses were known to infect humans : hcov-229e , hcov - oc43 , sars - cov ( sars - cov-1 ) , hcov - nl63 , cov - hku1 , and mers - cov.

8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b	transplantation of remyelination - competent cells represents a promising strategy for the treatment of demyelinating diseases .
8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b	as the environment dictates the success or failure of remyelination , it is critical to understand the role that the immune system plays in transplantmediated remyelination .
8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b	in this study , we evaluated the severity of neuroinflammation following transplantation of glial - committed progenitor cells into the spinal cords of mice chronically infected with mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) , a model in which t cells and macrophages are critical in amplifying the severity of demyelination .
8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b	transplantation was performed following viral persistence in which inflammation and demyelination are established and clinical disease is evident .

8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b	treatment did not alter accumulation of t cells or macrophages within the cns as compared to control mice .
8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b	moreover , progenitor cell implantation did not affect local cytokine / chemokine gene expression in the cns .

8b4e93d21e5959601e1d6f0f6705b28bb3ce553b	these studies demonstrate that progenitor cell - mediated remyelination is not the result of modulating the composition of the cellular infiltrate nor cytokine expression by virusspecific t cells and suggest that remyelination may not depend on amelioration of the inflammatory response or alteration of cytokine secretion by virus - specific t cells .

d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	h9n2 viruses are the most widespread influenza viruses in poultry in asia .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	we evaluated the infection and tropism of human and avian h9 influenza virus in the human respiratory tract using ex vivo respiratory organ culture .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	h9 viruses infected the upper and lower respiratory tract and the majority of h9 viruses had a decreased ability to release virus from the bronchus rather than the lung .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	this may be attributed to a weak neuraminidase ( na ) cleavage of carbon-6-linked sialic acid ( sia ) rather than carbon-3-linked sia .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	the modified cleavage of n - acetlylneuraminic acid ( neu5ac ) and n - glycolylneuraminic acid ( neu5gc ) by na in h9 virus replication was observed by reverse genetics , and recombinant h9n2 viruses with amino acids ( 38kq ) deleted in the na stalk , and changing the amino acid at position 431 from proline - to - lysine .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	using recombinant h9 viruses previously evaluated in the ferret , we found that viruses which replicated well in the ferret did not replicate to the same extent in the human ex vivo cultures .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	the existing risk assessment models for h9n2 viruses in ferrets may not always have a strong correlation with the replication in the human upper respiratory tract .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	the inclusion of the human ex vivo cultures would further strengthen the future risk - assessment strategies .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	most influenza viruses are widely established in the waterfowl population .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	while much attention has been given to the h5n1 and h7n9 subtypes , because of their disease severity in humans , another subtype , h9n2 , has widely circulated in poultry in many regions of the world .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	h9n2 was first detected in turkeys in 1966 , shorebirds in 1988 , and then in ducks and chickens 1 , 2 .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	it is now the most widespread and prevalent influenza virus in asia .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	the government of hong kong special administrative region implemented interventions starting from 2001 to control this infection , by executing a mandatory monthly rest day , live quail sale ban , and in the subsequent years a biweekly rest day in the wet markets .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	prior to these interventions in live bird market trading , the h9n2 virus isolation rate in hong kong 's live poultry markets was around 5 % of all birds tested increasing to almost 20 % in game - birds such as quail 3 .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	these isolation rates are presumably similar in the greater china region in which h9n2 is regarded as the most prevalent subtype of influenza in chickens ( reviewed in ref .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	4 ) , where market interventions applied in hong kong have not been used .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	phylogenetic analysis has shown that the three main lineages ( korean , g1 and chicken / beijing/1/94-like ) of h9n2 viruses have developed from ck / bei and reassorted , with other h9 strains 1 .
d2ac1b9fae19dbf111222f50982b4ed38e2f8e28	even though h9n2 infection is mainly confined to poultry , h9n2 viruses have been detected repeatedly in swine in china 5 , 6 .

facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	infectious disease interventions like contact precautions and vaccination have proven effective in disease control and elimination .
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	the priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen is , and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively to disease dynamics .
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	however , mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed .
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	here , our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence .
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	we couple a compartmental susceptible - infectious - recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence , with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population .
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	we perform invasion analysis , time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain .
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	we demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios , even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain .
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	surprisingly , in some situations , increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain .
facf8de7132101d9bbccf456b448f97fdebd44fe	our results demonstrate that for certain applications , it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens , so that the models can better assist public health effort s to control infectious diseases .

16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction ( nlutd ) , including neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( ndo ) and detrusor - sphincter dyssynergia , is one of the most frequent and devastating sequelae of spinal cord injury ( sci ) , as it can lead to urinary incontinence and secondary damage such as renal failure .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( ttns ) is a promising , non - invasive neuromodulatory intervention that may prevent the emergence of the c - fibre evoked bladder reflexes that are thought to cause ndo .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	this paper presents the protocol for tasci ( ttns in acute sci ) , which will evaluate the efficacy of ttns in preventing ndo .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	furthermore , tasci will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying ttns , and the course of nlutd development after sci .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	tasci is a nationwide , randomised , sham - controlled , double - blind clinical trial , conducted at all four sci centres in switzerland .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	the longitudinal design includes a baseline assessment period 5 - 39 days after acute sci and follow - up assessments occurring three , six , and twelve months after sci .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	a planned 114 participants will be randomised into verum or sham ttns groups ( 1:1 ratio ) , stratified on study centre and lower extremity motor score .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	ttns is performed for 30-minutes per day , five days per week , for 6 - 9 weeks starting within 40 days after sci .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	the primary outcome is the occurrence of ndo jeopardizing the upper urinary tract at one year after sci , assessed by urodynamic investigation .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	secondary outcome measures assess bladder and bowel function and symptoms , sexual function , neurological structure and function , functional independence , quality of life , as well as changes in biomarkers in the urine , blood , stool , and bladder tissue .
16d9567662f99cc628165d380be5db8d2c26e0d9	safety of ttns is the tertiary outcome .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases are always on the rise , especially in poorer countries and in the aging population .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	the inevitable , but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	hiv / aids , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , and
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	the more recent h1n1 influenza are only a few of the numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern era .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	however despite advances in diagnostics , therapeutics and vaccines , there is need for more specific , efficacious , cost - effective and less toxic treatment and preventive drugs .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	in this chapter , we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity , efficacy and limited off - site toxicity , and diagnostic tools with great precision .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	although time consuming , immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high - affinity antibodies and antibody - like fragments .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	the selection of binding fragments from phage display libraries has proven significant for routine isolation of invaluable peptides , antibodies , and antibody - like domains for diagnostic and therapeutic applications .
aa82f2d3c703e9d9fc937a6ae1bb9594a7ac9098	here we highlight the many benefits of combining immunisation with phage display in combating infectious diseases , and how our knowledge of antibody engineering has played a crucial role in fully exploiting these platforms in generating therapeutic and diagnostic biologics towards antigenic targets of infectious organisms .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	respiratory tract infections ( rtis ) are extremely common especially in the first year of life .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	knowledge of the etiology of a rti is essential to facilitate the appropriate management and the implementation of the most effective control measures .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	this perspective explains why laboratory methods that can identify pathogens in respiratory secretions have been developed over the course of many years .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	high - complexity multiplex panel assays that can simultaneously detect up to 20 viruses and up to four bacteria within a few hours have been marketed .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	however , are these platforms actually useful in pediatric clinical practice ?
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	in this manuscript , we showed that these platforms appear to be particularly important for epidemiological studies and clinical research .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	on the contrary , their routine use in pediatric clinical practice remains debatable .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	they can be used only in the hospital as they require specific equipment and laboratory technicians with considerable knowledge , training , and experience .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	moreover , despite more sensitive and specific than other tests routinely used for respiratory pathogen identification , they do not offer significantly advantage for detection of the true etiology of a respiratory disease .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	furthermore , knowledge of which virus is the cause of a respiratory disease is not useful from a therapeutic point of view unless influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus are the infecting agents as effective drugs are available only for these pathogens .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	on the other hand , multiplex platforms can be justified in the presence of severe clinical manifestations , and in immunocompromised patients for whom specific treatment option can be available , particularly when they can be used simultaneously with platforms that allow identification of antimicrobial resistance to commonly used drugs .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	it is highly likely that these platforms , particularly those with high sensitivity and specificity and with low turnaround time , will become essential when new drugs effective and safe against most of the respiratory viruses will be available .
396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439	further studies on how to differentiate carriers from patients with true disease , as well as studies on the implications of coinfections and identification of antimicrobial resistance , are warranted .

08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	in human medicine , " sudden death " has been defined by the world health organization ( who ) as a non - violent , unexpected death occurring less than 24 h from the onset of symptoms .
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	the aims of this study were : ( 1 ) to estimate the proportional mortality ratio for " sudden and unexpected death " ( sud ) in young dogs ; ( 2 ) to investigate the pathological and microbiological findings in sud cases in young dogs .
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	for these purposes , a retrospective study of a total of 145 cases of young dead dogs was performed .
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	for each case , we collected information about the age , medical history and the gross and microbiological findings of the animals .
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	the results of this study found 21 cases of sud .
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	the most frequently observed clinical symptoms in the cases of sudden death were acute respiratory symptoms , followed by acute gastroenteric symptoms , non - specific symptoms and neurological symptoms .
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	the evaluation of necropsy reports allowed us to observe enteritis in 18 out of 21 cases and pneumonia in seven out of 21 cases .
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	viral infection with canine parvovirus type 2 was the most common cause of sud observed .
08e9d8379e47f05fd68f2cb201d1e6f4af2278ef	these results could provide a valuable tool for the investigation of sudden death in young dogs .

42e321eedba25d380ae44d16cdf0bbdeab83d665	information on sapovirus infection of wildlife is limited and is currently lacking for any free - ranging wildlife species in africa .
42e321eedba25d380ae44d16cdf0bbdeab83d665	by screening a large number of predominantly fecal samples ( n = 631 ) obtained from five carnivore species in the serengeti ecosystem , east africa , sapovirus rna was detected in the spotted hyena ( crocuta crocuta , family hyaenidae ) , african lion ( panthera leo , family felidae ) , and bat - eared fox ( otocyon megalotis , family canidae ) , but not in golden or silver - backed jackals ( canis aureus and c. mesomelas , respectively , family canidae ) .
42e321eedba25d380ae44d16cdf0bbdeab83d665	a phylogenetic analysis based on partial rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) gene sequences placed the sapovirus strains from african carnivores in a monophyletic group .
42e321eedba25d380ae44d16cdf0bbdeab83d665	within this monophyletic group , sapovirus strains from spotted hyenas formed one independent sub - group , and those from bat - eared fox and african lion a second sub - group .
42e321eedba25d380ae44d16cdf0bbdeab83d665	the percentage nucleotide similarity between sapoviruses from african carnivores and those from other species was low ( < 70.4 % ) .

a08e6e3d8c3de886ae461ca0843a51d80b62e855	it has been established that the s protein in this pathogen plays an important rule in the adsorption and penetration of sars - cov into the host cell by interaction with the ace2 receptor .
a08e6e3d8c3de886ae461ca0843a51d80b62e855	to determinant which functional motif of the s protein was involved in the interaction with ace2 , seven truncated s proteins deleted from the n or c terminal were obtained by an e.coli expression system and purified by column chromatography to homogeneity .
a08e6e3d8c3de886ae461ca0843a51d80b62e855	each truncated s protein was fixed on to the well of an elisa plate and an interaction was initiated with the ace2 protein .
a08e6e3d8c3de886ae461ca0843a51d80b62e855	the adsorption were quantified by elisa , and the results indicated that amino acids from 388 to 496 of the s protein was responsible for the interaction with the ace2 receptor , and the interaction could be completely disrupted by an antibody specific to these amino acids .
a08e6e3d8c3de886ae461ca0843a51d80b62e855	deletions adjacent to this domain did not appear to have a significant impact on the interaction with ace2 , suggesting that the s protein of sars - cov could be developed as a vaccine to prevent the spread of

d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	by staying home , people reduce the probability of contacting an infectious individual , becoming infected , and passing on the virus .
d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	one of the most promising sources of data on time use is smartphone location data .

d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	resuming pre - epidemic behavior would lead to a rapid rise in cases in most counties .
d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	spatial patterns of bending and flattening the curve are robust to modeling assumptions .
d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	depending on epidemic history , county demographics , and behavior within a county , returning those with acquired immunity ( assuming it exists ) to regular schedules generally helps reduce cumulative covid-19 cases .
d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	the model robustly identifies which counties would experience the greatest share of case reduction relative to continued distancing behavior .
d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	the model occasionally mischaracterizes epidemic patterns in counties tightly connected to larger counties that are experiencing large epidemics .
d94c301ebc09434b1d33abb4eaf41f1302f04b99	understanding these patterns is critical for prioritizing testing resources and back - to - work planning for the united states .

ec12056191b32c3676eeb2648b11e4e8fbebcf62	to provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments , we report here an " unextracted modification " for qrt - pcr using the centers for disease control 's ( cdc 's ) widely utilized primers / probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
ec12056191b32c3676eeb2648b11e4e8fbebcf62	( n1 / n2 / n3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and rp - control targeting human rnase p ) .

ec12056191b32c3676eeb2648b11e4e8fbebcf62	using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow , we compared traditional and unextracted cdc methodologies .
ec12056191b32c3676eeb2648b11e4e8fbebcf62	although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident ( by higher c t values ) without extraction , in particular for the n2 primer / probe - set , we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for n1 , and rp ( unconcentrated and concentrated vtm-81/81 ) .
ec12056191b32c3676eeb2648b11e4e8fbebcf62	the negative categorical agreement for n1 / n2 / n3 was likewise high .

ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	we studied hospitalized adults with covid-19 and pf1.2 measurement performed at any time during hospitalization .
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	we evaluated the relationship between pf1.2 and synchronously measured d - dimer .
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	we utilized receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analysis to evaluate optimal thresholds for diagnosing thrombosis and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate association with thrombosis .
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	results :
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	115 patients were included [ 110 ( 95.7 % ) critically ill ] .
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	pf1.2 and ddimer were moderately positively correlated ( r=0.542 , p<0.001 )

ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	median pf1.2 levels were higher in patients with thrombosis than those without ( 611 vs. 374 pmol / l , p=0.006 ) .
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	in roc analysis , pf1.2 had superior specificity and conferred a higher positive likelihood ratio in identifying patients with thrombosis than d - dimer ( pf1.2 threshold of > 523 pmol / l : 69.2 % sensitivity , 67.7 % specificity ; > 924 pmol / l : 37.9 % sensitivity , 87.8 % specificity ) .
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	in multivariable analysis , a pf1.2 > 500 pmol / l was significantly associated with vte [ adjusted odds ratio ( or ) 4.26 , 95 % ci , 1.12 - 16.21 , p=0.034 ] and any thrombotic manifestation ( adjusted or 3.85 , 95 % ci , 1.39 - 10.65 , p=0.010 ) ; conversely , synchronously measured d - dimer was not significantly associated with thrombosis .
ea7b1ef87a0fe8aeaddca03d4bec562eb46fcfc0	90.6 % of patients with a non - elevated pf1.2 result did not develop vte .

aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	next , we found that alv - j chn06 strain infection of df-1 cells correlated with extracellular signal - regulated kinase 2 ( erk2 ) activation , which was mainly induced within 15 min , a very early stage of infection , and at a late infection stage , from 108 h to 132 h post - infection .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	infection with other alv subgroup ( a / b ) strains also triggered erk / mapk activation .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	moreover , when activating erk2 , alv subgroups a , b and j simultaneously induced the phosphorylation of c - jun , an ap1 family member and p38 activation but had no obvious effect on jnk activation at either 15 min or 120
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	h. interestingly , only pd98059 inhibited the alv - induced c - jun phosphorylation while sp600125 or sb203580 had no influence on c - jun activation .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	furthermore , the viral gp85 and gag proteins were found to contribute to erk2 / ap1 activation .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	additionally , the specific erk inhibitor , pd980509 , significantly suppressed alv replication , as evidenced by extremely low levels of alv promoter activity and alv - j protein expression .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	avian leukosis viruses ( alv ) , an oncogenic retrovirus , mainly induce neoplastic diseases and other reproduction problems by both vertical and horizontal transmission infection .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	based on the identity of viral envelope glycoproteins , alv is divided into subgroups a , b , c , d , e , j and the recently identified subgroup k 1,2 .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	so far , most of isolated and identified alv in china pertain to subgroups a , b and j inducing disease in the commercial meat and egg type chickens as well as in the chinese local breeds 3 - 6 .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	alv can cause significant economic losses as a result of tumor - induced mortality , serious immunosuppression and reduction of weight gain , egg production and breeding potential .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	widespread alv - j can induce various tumors in chickens , especially myeloid leukosis and hemangioma .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	our previous study demonstrated that myc , tert , and zic1genes were identified as the common insertion sites in alv - j induced myeloid leukosis , which might be a putative " driver " for the activation of the oncogene 7 .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	however , the cellular factors involved in exogenous alv infection and oncogenesis , especially signal transduction pathways , are yet to be revealed .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification ( itraq ) is a stable isotope method for protein measurement by using mass spectrometry 8 .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	in the current study , we applied itraq
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	followed by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) to compare the protein profile of df-1 cell line with and without alv - j infection .
aa080b8ad0bb2c4cd4e24f407b32f0e837c27432	based on the proteome data and western blot confirmation , we inferred that the up - regulation of
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	feline calicivirus ( fcv ) is an important veterinary pathogen and causes respiratory disease in cats .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	because it grows well in cell culture , fcv is often used as a model virus of non - culturable caliciviruses .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	in this study , a cell - free and two cell culture - based biosensor assay systems were established to detect fcv protease activity .

906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	a luciferase sensor was designed to contain an fcv protease cleavage motif within the permutated luciferase ( glosensor ) .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	the bret 2 -based probe contained the same cleavage motif flanked by a renilla luciferase and a variant of green fluorescent protein .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	to confirm the specificity of these assay systems , glosensor or a bret 2 -based probe containing a mutation in the cleavage motif was also constructed .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	in a cell - free assay , glosensor showed increased luminescence in proportion to the amount of fcv protease , while no signal change was observed when the construct harboring the mutant cleavage motif was used .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	a feline cell line stably expressing glosensor or the bret 2 -based probe was established .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	increased levels of glosensor luminescence , and decreased levels of bret 2 signals were observed according to input fcv titers .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	in contrast , no significant signal change was observed in the cells stably expressing the mutant cleavage motif .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	glosensor and the bret 2 -based probe were capable of detecting the inhibitory activity of ribavirin in fcv - infected cells .
906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3	our results demonstrate that these biosensors are useful to detect fcv protease activity induced in infected cells , and well worth consideration for screening of anti - fcv protease compounds in cell - free system as well as anti - fcv compounds in cultured cells .

6058e813e7b4c4f5c57eba44da2463bd5774574b	the strong degree of interstrain homology among the five mhv strains investigated was confirmed by comparative chymotryptic peptide mapping of the viral n proteins .

6058e813e7b4c4f5c57eba44da2463bd5774574b	moreover , this technique of peptide mapping indicated a particularly strong relatedness between mhv-1 and mhv - s and among mhv3 , jhm , and a59 .

58246d246bb1b2288dc58245c475fc314d34cc83	oct4 is a key component of the pluripotency regulatory network , and its reciprocal interaction with cdx2 has been shown to be a determinant of either the self - renewal of embryonic stem cells ( escs ) or their differentiation into trophoblast .
58246d246bb1b2288dc58245c475fc314d34cc83	oct4 of maternal origin is postulated to play critical role in defining totipotency and inducing pluripotency during embryonic development .
58246d246bb1b2288dc58245c475fc314d34cc83	however , the genetic elimination of maternal oct4 using a cre - lox approach in mouse revealed that the establishment of totipotency in maternal oct4-depleted embryos was not affected , and that these embryos could complete full - term development without any obvious defect .
58246d246bb1b2288dc58245c475fc314d34cc83	these results indicate that oct4 is not essential for the initiation of pluripotency , in contrast to its critical role in maintaining pluripotency .
58246d246bb1b2288dc58245c475fc314d34cc83	this conclusion is further supported by the formation of oct4-gfp - and nanog - expressing inner cell masses ( icms ) in embryos with complete inactivation of both maternal and zygotic oct4 expression and the reprogramming of fibroblasts into fully pluripotent cells by oct4-deficient oocytes .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	it is often said that it takes 17 years to move medical research from bench to bedside .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	in a coronavirus disease world , such time - lags feel intolerable .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	in these extraordinary circumstances could years be made into months ?
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	if so , could those lessons be used to accelerate medical research when the crisis eases ?
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	to measure time - lags in health and biomedical research as well as to identify ways of reducing them , we developed and published ( in 2015 )
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	a matrix consisting of overlapping tracks ( or stages / phases ) in the translation from discovery research to developed products , policies and practice .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	the matrix aids analysis by highlighting the time and actions required to develop research ( and its translation ) both ( 1 ) along each track and ( 2 ) from one track to another , e.g. from the discovery track to the research - in - humans track .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	we noted four main approaches to reducing time - lags , namely increasing resources , working in parallel , starting or working at risk , and improving processes .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	examining these approaches alongside the matrix helps interpret the enormous global effort to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus sars - cov-2 , the causative agent of covid-19 .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	rapid progress in the discovery / basic and human research tracks is being made through a combination of large - scale funding , work being conducted in parallel ( between different teams globally and through working in overlapping tracks ) , working at greater ( but proportionate ) risk to safety than usual , and adopting various new processes .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	the overlapping work of some of the teams involves continuing animal research whilst entering vaccine candidates into phase i trials alongside planning their phase ii trials .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	the additional funding available helps to reduce some of the usual financial risks in moving so quickly .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	going forward through the increasingly large human trials for safety , dosage and efficacy , it will be vital to overlap work in parallel in the often challenging public policy and clinical tracks .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	thus , regulatory and reimbursement bodies are beginning and preparing rapid action to pull vaccines proving to be safe and effective through to extraordinarily rapid application to the general population .
97135b43ae17f4127ca7dc7a4f31c217afa524e4	monitoring the development of a covid-19 vaccine using the matrix ( modified as necessary ) could help identify which of the approaches speeding development and deployment could be usefully applied more widely in the future .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	objective : in this study we execute a rational screen to identify chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) , an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	methods :
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	there were two main steps in the screening process .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	in the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	resulting compounds were cross - checked for listing in the traditional chinese medicine systems pharmacology database .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption , distribution , metabolism and excretion ( adme ) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	next , a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-ncov protein interaction .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	in the second step we searched chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	finally , network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	results :
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	of the natural compounds screened , 13 that exist in traditional chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-ncov activity .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	further , 125 chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	of these 125 herbs , 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection , immune / inflammation reactions and hypoxia response .
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	conclusion
d3fb8500862db1ce9cc299443a6d31209fab5602	: chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-ncov compounds .

a31ab266e29c84202fb292bd667319662c8337cf	rna viruses are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in humans every year .
a31ab266e29c84202fb292bd667319662c8337cf	additionally , the potential use of these viruses in acts of bioterrorism poses a threat to national security .
a31ab266e29c84202fb292bd667319662c8337cf	given the paucity of vaccines or postexposure therapeutics for many highly pathogenic rna viruses , novel treatments are badly needed .

790c6002db87c03cd6bdab85964c52808d09a218	notably , the development of replicating - competent reporter - expressing viruses ( rcrevs ) has provided an excellent option to detect directly viral replication without the use of secondary labeling , which represents a significant advance in virology .

790c6002db87c03cd6bdab85964c52808d09a218	however , there remain various challenges associated with rcrevs , including pathogenicity alterations due to the insertion of a reporter gene , instability or loss of the reporter gene expression , or attenuation of reporter signals in vivo .
790c6002db87c03cd6bdab85964c52808d09a218	despite all these limitations , rcrevs have become powerful tools for both basic and applied virology with the development of new technologies for generating rcrevs , the inventions of novel reporters and the better understanding of regulation of viral replication .

c5db08a4925ae08d69530ee3c2bb263f8fd9fca4	since beginning of this century , there have already been three zoonotic outbreaks of beta - covs .

04370cab067c5371a34c90e8f7551926466a6290	compared to other countries , indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of covid-19 .
04370cab067c5371a34c90e8f7551926466a6290	to raise the understanding of the natural history of the pandemic , we grouped the period into four different phases : phase 1 ( there was confirmed cases in indonesia but no cases found in yogyakarta ) , phase 2 ( the first case in yogyakarta detected ) , phase 3 ( the time when the cumulative cases surpass its peak ) , and phase 4 ( the pandemic ends ) .
04370cab067c5371a34c90e8f7551926466a6290	at the time of this writing , we were still in phase 2 and in this phase , we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures , from an average of 4 to 2.4 procedures per week .

a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	estimation of the inner state of volcanoes are important for understanding the mechanism of eruption and reduction of disaster risk .
a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	with the improvement in observation networks , data assimilation of internal magma state using time - history crustal deformation data observed at the surface is expected to be suitable for solving such problems .
a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	using finite - element methods capable of modeling complex geometry is desirable for modeling the three - dimensional heterogeneous crust structure , and nonlinear time - history analysis is required for considering the change in material properties due to the movement of magma .
a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	thus , many cases of large - scale finite - element analysis is required , and the computational cost incurred is expected to become a bottleneck .
a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	as a basic study towards data assimilation of internal magma state considering change in material properties of the crust , we demonstrated that many case analyses of volcano deformation problems can be conducted in a reasonable time frame by development of a crustal deformation analysis method accelerated by gpus .
a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	for verification of the data assimilation method , we estimated the magma trend in an actual threedimensional heterogeneous crust structure without temporal change in material properties .
a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	we confirmed that the magma movement trend can be reproduced using the model considering crust heterogeneity , while models disregarding three - dimensional crust structure resulted in wrong estimations .
a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8	thus , we can see that using finite - element methods capable of modeling three - dimensional heterogeneity for crustal deformation analysis is important for accurate magma state estimation .

e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	hpv binding to the cell surface of keratinocytes leads to virus endocytosis at tetraspanin enriched microdomains .
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	complex interactions of the capsid proteins with host proteins as well as adam17-dependent erk1/2 signal transduction enable the entry platform assembly of the oncogenic hpv type 16 .
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	here , we studied the importance of tetraspanin cd9 , also known as tspan29 , in hpv16 infection of different epithelial cells .
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	we found that both overexpression and loss of the tetraspanin decreased infection rates in cells with low endogenous cd9 levels , while reduction of cd9 expression in keratinocytes that exhibit high - cd9 protein amounts , led to an increase of infection .
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	therefore , we concluded that low - cd9 supports infection .
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	moreover , we found that changes in cd9 amounts affect the shedding of the adam17 substrate transforming growth factor alpha ( tgfα ) and the downstream phosphorylation of erk .
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	these effects correlate with those on infection rates suggesting that a specific cd9 optimum promotes adam17 activity , erk signalling and virus infection .
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	together , our findings implicate that cd9 regulates hpv16 infection through the modulation of adam17 sheddase activity .

c504d9c3d10546a02fd574211e5f5bb75ca46794	induction of ali by lps was confirmed based on histopathological changes .
c504d9c3d10546a02fd574211e5f5bb75ca46794	lps administration induced significant increases in the expression of par isoforms ( protein ) at the level of transcription in ali .
c504d9c3d10546a02fd574211e5f5bb75ca46794	while the time course of par-1 and -2 expressions were different , those of par-3 and -4 were almost similar .
c504d9c3d10546a02fd574211e5f5bb75ca46794	an immunohistochemical analysis showed localization of par isoforms in the vascular endothelium , alveolar epithelium , and alveolar macrophages .
c504d9c3d10546a02fd574211e5f5bb75ca46794	however , the cellular distribution patterns of par isoforms were different .
c504d9c3d10546a02fd574211e5f5bb75ca46794	we conclude that lps induces increase in protein expression of par isoforms at the level of transcription in rats with ali .
c504d9c3d10546a02fd574211e5f5bb75ca46794	the differential expression patterns ( over a time course ) and distribution of par isoforms suggests a distinct role for each isoform in the pathogenesis of lps - induced ali .

bf2c7d9dace90947f1eb116186569036bd0bcba4	we read with great interest the study by siyu chen and colleagues .
bf2c7d9dace90947f1eb116186569036bd0bcba4	the authors evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of five pregnant patients with covid-19 at term , whose delivery was uneventful and led to favorable perinatal outcomes for both mother and neonate .
bf2c7d9dace90947f1eb116186569036bd0bcba4	we would like to draw attention to a growing body of evidence that now points towards an under - addressed association between preterm maternal sars - cov-2 infection , preterm delivery and adverse neonatal outcomes , which is not reflected in chen et
bf2c7d9dace90947f1eb116186569036bd0bcba4	al . 's small cohort .
bf2c7d9dace90947f1eb116186569036bd0bcba4	we also stress that vertical transmission , which was not tested for by chen et al . , should not be excluded as a potential mechanism for viral spread .

479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	we aimed to evaluate excess cardiovascular mortality during covid-19 pandemic in 6 brazilian capital cities .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	methods :
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	using the civil registry public database , we evaluated total and cardiovascular excess deaths , further stratified in acs , stroke and unspecified cardiovascular deaths in the 6 brazilian cities with greater number of covid-19 deaths ( são paulo , rio de janeiro , fortaleza , recife , belém , manaus ) .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	we compared data from epidemiological weeks 12 to 22 of 2020 , with the same period in 2019 .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	we also compared the number of hospital and home deaths during the period .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	results :
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	there were 69,328 deaths and 17,877 covid-19 deaths in the studied period and cities for 2020 .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	cardiovascular mortality increased in most cities , with greater magnitude in the northern capitals .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	however , while there was a reduction in acs and stroke in the most developed cities , the northern capitals showed an increase of these events .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	for unspecified cardiovascular deaths , there was a marked increase in all cities , which strongly correlated to the rise in home deaths
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	( r=0.86 , p=0.01 ) .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	the excess cardiovascular mortality was greater in the less developed cities , possibly associated with healthcare collapse .
479c35aaa89e244dac10c8dd7e4c5dcd797f4761	acs and stroke deaths decreased in the most developed cities , in parallel with an increase in unspecified cardiovascular and home deaths , presumably as a result of misdiagnosis .

bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	background :
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	a33 is a type ii integral membrane protein expressed on the extracellular enveloped form of vaccinia virus ( vacv ) .

bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	homologs of a33 are highly conserved among members of the orthopoxvirus genus and are potential candidates for inclusion in vaccines or assays targeting extracellular enveloped virus activity .
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	one monoclonal antibody directed against vacv a33 , mab-1g10 , has been shown to target a conformation - dependent epitope .
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	interestingly , while it recognizes vacv a33 as well as the corresponding variola homolog , it does not bind to the monkeypox homolog .
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	in this study , we utilized a random phage display library to investigate the epitope recognized by mab-1g10 that is critical for facilitating cell - to - cell spread of the vaccinia virus .
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	results :
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	by screening with linear or conformational random phage libraries , we found that phages binding to mab-1g10 display the consensus motif ceplc , with a disulfide bond formed between two cysteine residues required for mab-1g10 binding .
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	although the phage motif contained no linear sequences homologous to vacv a33 , structure modeling and analysis suggested that residue d115 is important to form the minimal epitope core .
bf7d69e6d9d85c3870025ee9e51632ca44283441	a panel of point mutants expressing the ectodomain of a33 protein was generated and analyzed by either binding assays such as elisa and immunoprecipitation or a functional assessment by blocking mab-1g10 mediated comet inhibition in cell culture .

0c511b038d99327b33d8db5305ff69ecd2fe764e	in the present study , after eliminating other confounding risk factors ( including age , gender and comorbidities ) , we further investigated and confirmed the association of abo blood groups and risk of sars - cov-2 pneumonia in patients from the central hospital of wuhan , as well as two hospitals in wuhan , china .
0c511b038d99327b33d8db5305ff69ecd2fe764e	patients diagnosed with sars - cov-2 who died or were discharged between february 1 and march 25 , 2020 , were included in this retrospective cohort study .
0c511b038d99327b33d8db5305ff69ecd2fe764e	the study was approved by the ethics committee of the central hospital of wuhan , and the need for informed consent was waived .

0c511b038d99327b33d8db5305ff69ecd2fe764e	the abo blood group in 265 patients infected with sars - cov-2 from the central hospital of wuhan showed a distribution of 39á3 % , 25á3 % , 9á8 % and 25á7 % for a , b , ab and o , respectively ( table i ) .
0c511b038d99327b33d8db5305ff69ecd2fe764e	the proportion of blood group a in patients infected with sars - cov-2 was significantly higher than that in healthy controls ( 39á3 % vs. 32á3 % , p = 0á017 ) , 7 while the proportion of blood group o in patients infected with sars - cov-2 was significantly lower than that in healthy controls ( 25á7 % vs. 33á8 % , p < 0á01 ) .
0c511b038d99327b33d8db5305ff69ecd2fe764e	we next investigated whether age , gender and chronic disease influence the abo blood group distribution ( table i ) .
0c511b038d99327b33d8db5305ff69ecd2fe764e	the results showed that , among blood group a ( 43á6 % vs. 32á2 % in controls , p < 0á01 ) and blood group o ( 22á2 % vs. 33á8 % in controls , p < 0á01 ) , patients over 60 years of age were consistent with all the above patients .

12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	bats are the natural host reservoir for range of emerging and re - emerging viruses , many of which cause significant morbidity and mortality in other mammals , yet appear to result in no clinical consequences for bats .
12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	the ability of bats to coexist with a variety of viruses presents an interesting immunological problem that has not been examined in any detail but which could provide significant insights into the evolution of antiviral mechanisms in mammals .
12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	towards a better understanding of the bat immune system , we analysed the expressed heavy chain variable ( vh ) regions of antibodies from the black flying fox , pteropus alecto .
12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	the germline repertoire of the closely related pteropid bat , pteropus vampyrus , whose genome has been sequenced was also examined for comparative purposes .
12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	representative vh genes were found in all three mammalian vh clans ( i , ii and iii ) in both the expressed p. alecto vh repertoire and the germline p. vampyrus vh repertoire .
12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	evidence for the use of multiple heavy chain diversity ( dh ) and joining ( jh ) segments for the generation of diverse vdj rearrangements was also present in the expressed antibody repertoire of p. alecto .
12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	the long period of co - evolutionary history of bats with viruses may have resulted in a variety of highly specific vh segments being hardwired into the genomes of bats and may have implications for their ability to successfully cope with a diversity of viral antigens .

9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	schools are socially dense environments , and school - based outbreaks often predate and fuel communitywide transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	while preemptive school closures can effectively reduce influenza transmission , they are disruptive and currently recommended only for pandemics .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	we assessed the feasibility of implementing other social distancing practices in k-12 schools as a first step in seeking an alternative to preemptive school closures .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	methods :
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	we conducted 36 focus groups with education and public health officials across the united states .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	we identified and characterized themes and compared feasibility of practices by primary versus secondary school and region of the united states .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	results :
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	participants discussed 29 school practices ( 25 within - school practices implemented as part of the school day and 4 reduced - schedule practices that impact school hours ) .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	participants reported that elementary schools commonly implement several within - school practices as part of routine operations such as homeroom stay , restriction of hall movement , and staggering of recess times .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	because of routine implementation and limited use of individualized schedules within elementary schools , within - school practices were generally felt to be more feasible for elementary schools than secondary schools .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	of reduced - schedule practices , shortening the school week and the school day was considered the most feasible ; however , reduced - schedule practices were generally perceived to be less feasible than within - school practices for all grade levels .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	conclusions :
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	our findings suggest that schools have many options to increase social distance other than closing .
9cfb252a392f1d07063c7b99001e117758fae37d	future research should evaluate which of these seemingly feasible practices are effective in reducing influenza transmission in schools and surrounding communities .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	background :
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	the limitations of forecasting ( real - time statistical ) and predictive ( dynamic epidemiological ) models have become apparent as covid-19 has progressed from a rapid exponential ascent to a slower decent , which is dependent on unknowable parameters such as extent of social distancing and easing .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	we present a means to optimize a forecasting model by functionalizing our previously reported asymmetric gaussian model with seir - like parameters .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	conversely , seir models can be adapted to better incorporate real - time data .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	methods :
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	our previously reported asymmetric gaussian model was shown to greatly improve on forecasting accuracy relative to use of symmetric functions , such as gaussian and error functions for death rates and cumulative deaths , respectively .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	however , the reported asymmetric gaussian implementation , which fitted well to the ascent and much of the recovery side of the real death rate data , was not agile enough to respond to changing social behavior that is resulting in persistence of infections and deaths in the later stage of recovery .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	we have introduced a time - dependent σ(t ) parameter to account for transmission rate variability due to the effects of behavioral changes such as social distancing and subsequent social easing .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	the σ(t ) parameter is analogous to the basic reproduction number r0 ( infection factor ) that is evidently not a constant during the progression of covid-19 for a particular population .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	the popularly used seir model and its many variants are also incorporating a time dependent r0(t ) to better describe the effects of social distancing and social easing to improve predictive capability when extrapolating from real - time data .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	results :
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	comparisons are given for the previously reported asymmetric gaussian model and to the revised , what we call , seir gaussian model .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	we also have developed an analogous model based on r0(t ) that we call seir statistical model to show the correspondence that can be attained .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	it is shown that these two models can replicate each other and therefore provide similar forecasts based on fitting to the same real - time data .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	we show the results for reported u.s. death rates up to june 12 , 2020 at which time the cumulative death count was 113,820 .

793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	ihme model are 140,440 , 139,272 , and 149,690 ( for 8/4/20 ) and 147,819 , 148 , 912 , and 201,129 ( for 10/1/20 ) , respectively .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	we also show how the seir asymmetric gaussian model can also account for various scenarios of social distancing , social easing , and even rebound outbreaks where the death and case rates begin climbing again .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	conclusions :
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	forecasting models , based on real - time data , are essential for guiding policy and human behavior to minimize the deadly impact of covid-19 while balancing the need to socialize and energize the economy .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	it is becoming clear that changing social behavior from isolation to easing requires models that can adapt to the changing transmission rate in order to more accurately forecast death and case rates .
793f99723aa787051a9440f25bd7694018f106b4	we believe our asymmetric gaussian approach has advantages over modified seir models in offering simpler governing equations that are dependent on fewer variables .

db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	small exogenous noncoding rnas ( ncrnas ) such as sirna and shrna are the active silencing agents , intended to target and cleave complementary mrnas in a specifi c way .
db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	they are widely and successfully employed in functional studies , and several ongoing and already completed sirna - based clinical trials suggest encouraging results in the regulation of overexpressed genes in disease .
db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	sirnas share many aspects of their biogenesis and function with mirnas , small ncrna molecules transcribed from endogenous genes which are able to repress the expression of target mrnas by either inhibiting their translation or promoting their degradation .

db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	thus , in the past recent years , molecular tools for mirna silencing , such as antagomirs and mirna sponges , have been developed .
db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	these molecules have shown their effi cacy in the derepression of genes downregulated by overexpressed mirnas .
db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	in particular , while a single antagomir is able to inhibit a single complementary mirna , an artifi cial sponge construct usually contains one or more binding sites for one or more mirnas and functions by competing with the natural targets of these mirnas .
db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	as a consequence , natural mirna targets are reexpressed at their physiological level .
db5d807cbacc0f14b477eaf58c1b37a4f9a8e7ac	in this chapter we review the most successful methods for the computational design of sirnas , antagomirs , and mirna sponges and describe the most popular tools that implement them .

03d40dcd5d29728439528bd955afcba42bc0c2b9	in this study , we first demonstrated that avfluigg01 targets a novel conformation - dependent epitope in the globular head region of h5n1 hemagglutinin ( ha ) .

6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	mathematical models are often regarded as recent innovations in the description and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics , but simple mathematical expressions have been in use for projection of epidemic trajectories for more than a century .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	we recently introduced a single equation model ( the incidence decay with exponential adjustment , or idea model )
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	that can be used for short - term epidemiological forecasting .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	in the mid-19th century , dr. william farr made the observation that epidemic events rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern that can be approximated by a bell - shaped curve .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	he noticed that this time - evolution behavior could be captured by a single mathematical formula ( " farr 's law " ) that could be used for epidemic forecasting .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	we show here that the idea model follows farr 's law , and show that for intuitive assumptions , farr 's law can be derived from the idea model .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	moreover , we show that both mathematical approaches , farr 's law and the idea model , resemble solutions of a susceptible - infectious - removed ( sir ) compartmental differential - equation model in an asymptotic limit , where the changes of disease transmission respond to control measures , and not only to the depletion of susceptible individuals .
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	this suggests that the concept of the reproduction number ðr 0
6d50402d52c9af24a8b2bc012c33116a7ccabdf3	þ was implicitly captured in farr 's ( pre - microbial era ) work , and also suggests that control of epidemics , whether via behavior change or intervention , is as integral to the natural history of epidemics as is the dynamics of disease transmission .
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	a strategy for preventing further spread of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic is to detect infections and isolate infected individuals without the need of extensive biospecimen testing .
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	objectives :
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among covid-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms , besides loss of smell and taste , most likely to correspond to a positive covid-19 diagnosis in non - severe cases .
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	design : community survey .
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	including loss of smell and taste ; 579 were positive and 1123 negative .
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	in this subset , we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59 % of covid-19 positive individuals compared to 18 % of those negative to the test , yielding an odds ratio ( or ) of covid-19 diagnosis of or[95%ci]=6.59[5.25 ; 8.27 ] ,
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	p= 1.90x10 -59 .
1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7	we also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste , fever , persistent cough , fatigue , diarrhoea , abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of covid-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44 ; 0.63 ] , specificity 0.86[0.80 ; 0.90 ] , roc - auc 0.77[0.72 ; 0.82 ] in the test set , and cross - validation roc - auc 0.75[0.72 ; 0.77 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) is the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs , and the n - terminal domain of tgev spike protein is generally recognized as both the virulence determinant and enteric tropism determinant .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	here , we assembled a full - length infectious cdna clone of tgev in a bacterial artificial chromosome .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	using a novel approach , the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat ( crispr)/crispr - associated protein 9 ( cas9 ) systems efficiently and rapidly rescued another recombinant virus with a 224-amino - acid deletion in the n - terminal domain of the tgev spike gene ( s_ntd224 ) , which is analogous to the n - terminal domain of porcine respiratory coronavirus .

35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	notably affected the tgev growth kinetics in pk-15 cells but was not essential for recombinant virus survival .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	in animal experiments with 13 two - day - old piglets , the tgev recombinant viruses with / without s_ntd224 deletion induced obvious clinical signs and mortality .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	together , our results directly demonstrated that s_ntd224 of tgev mildly influenced tgev virulence but was not the enteric tropism determinant and provide new insights for the development of a new attenuated vaccine against tgev .

35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) , one of the representative covs of the alphacoronavirus genus , is the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis ( tge ) in pigs [ 12 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	tgev is widespread in the pork industry , causes high mortality in neonatal pigs , and is generally thought to share a common ancestor with porcine respiratory coronavirus ( prcv )
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	[ 13 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	both tgev and prcv have a common cell receptor , aminopeptidase n ( apn ) , but a coreceptor ( neu5gc ) of tgev is recognized to confer enteric tropism to tgev [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	in addition , tgev always causes severe diarrhea , whereas prcv usually causes mild or no clinical signs [ 18 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	compared with tgev spike gene , large deletions ( 200 - 230 aa ) were found in the n - terminal domain of prcv spike gene [ 19 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	the n - terminal domain of the s - glycoprotein is considered to be responsible for the different clinical signs of tgev and prcv and is generally recognized as not only the virulence determinant but also an enteric tropism determinant [ 13 , 20 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	previous research has shown that prcvs are likely derived from an n - terminal amino - acid deletion of the tgev spike protein [ 15 , 21 ] , but direct evidence obtained from reverse genetics is still needed to confirm this hypothesis .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	since the first successful construction of tgev infectious clones , the various reverse genetic systems that have been developed have made a considerable contribution to cov research , particularly research in mers , sars , tgev , and pedv [ 22 ]

35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	among the various reverse genetics methods for covs , transfection of the full - length infectious cdna clone and cotransfection of the full - length rna and n gene transcripts are the most commonly adopted methods for the rescue of recombinant viruses [ 25 , 26 , [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	however , these methods usually require the manipulation of several cdna fragments or plasmids for the construction of a new mutant cov [ 31 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	although targeted rna recombination or the red - mediated recombination strategy might partly accelerate or simplify the process of constructing an infectious recombinant virus , the selection of the correct positive clone is also a time - consuming process [ 32 ]
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	[ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	in fact , the limitations of the various currently available traditional reverse genetics methods for cov genome manipulation , such as ligation with several cdna fragments in vitro , targeted rna recombination , division of toxic gene sequence propagation in bacteria , or recombinant vaccinia virus vectors , have severely hampered the speed and efficiency of developing cov reverse genetics techniques [ 23 , [ 36 ]

35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	in general , the crispr / cas system from streptococcus pyogenes , namely , the spycas9 protein with a mature single - guide rna ( sgrna ) , is used for in vitro dna cleavage [ 42 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	however , the in vitro editing of rna virus genomes , particularly viruses with large rna genomes , such as covs , using this method has not been reported .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	in this study , we successfully constructed a tgev infectious clone and utilized the molecular scissors of the crispr / cas9 system to rescue another tgev mutant with s_ntd224 deletion [ 45 ] .
35fd57d62eba3f9b7de6cd27ac5fe63a478a4197	through animal experiments involving challenge with two types of rescued recombinant tgev viruses , we elucidated that tgev s_ntd224 was not the determinant in viral enteric tropism and pathogenesis .

b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8	individual calf data from 4 experiments included daily intake of milk replacer , free water , electrolyte solution , and starter grain , as well as weekly body weight ( bw ) and frame measures for 21 d after arrival .
b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8	calves with a fecal score of > 2 for ≥3 consecutive days over the first 21 d of each experiment were retrospectively classified as diarrheic ( dia ; n = 96 ) ; the remainder were classified as healthy ( hea ; n = 217 ) .
b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8	other health issues were minimal .
b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8	the likelihood of elevated fecal score occurrence and the cumulative number of days with an elevated score were greater for dia calves than for hea calves .

b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8	cumulative milk replacer dry matter intake ( dmi ) and water consumed from milk replacer were significantly less for dia calves than for hea calves , because dia calves were more likely to refuse milk replacer .
b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8	cumulative starter dmi was decreased for dia versus hea calves .

b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8	: dia calves were less feed - efficient than hea calves .
b2f09950a0ebc08c28e57c3a9cfb5a1bb3c630b8	in conclusion , diarrhea in young calves decreases dmi , bw gain , and feed efficiency relative to hea calves within 21 d of arrival .

98ffae8d82c7e534fd8573095f711445b292c113	while anti - drug antibodies ( ada ) are a standard clinical measure of protein therapeutic immunogenicity , t cell epitopes in the primary sequences of these drugs are the key drivers or modulators of ada response , depending on the type of t cell response that is stimulated ( e.g. , t helper or regulatory t cells , respectively ) .
98ffae8d82c7e534fd8573095f711445b292c113	in a previous publication on t cell - dependent immunogenicity of biotherapeutics , we addressed mitigation efforts such as identifying and reducing the presence of t cell epitopes or t cell response to protein therapeutics prior to further development of the protein therapeutic for clinical use .
98ffae8d82c7e534fd8573095f711445b292c113	over the past 5 years , greater insight into the role of regulatory t cell epitopes and the conservation of t cell epitopes with self ( beyond germline ) has improved the preclinical assessment of immunogenic potential .

98ffae8d82c7e534fd8573095f711445b292c113	target effects have come into focus , given the emergence of protein and peptide drugs that target immune receptors in immuno - oncology applications .
98ffae8d82c7e534fd8573095f711445b292c113	lastly , new modalities are entering the clinic , leading to the need to revise certain aspects of the preclinical immunogenicity assessment pathway .
98ffae8d82c7e534fd8573095f711445b292c113	in addition to drugs that have multiple antibody - derived domains or non - antibody scaffolds , therapeutic drugs may now be introduced via viral vectors , cell - based constructs , or nucleic acid based therapeutics that may , in addition to delivering drug , also prime the immune system , driving immune response to the delivery vehicle as well as the encoded therapeutic , adding to the complexity of assessing immunogenicity risk .
98ffae8d82c7e534fd8573095f711445b292c113	while it is challenging to keep pace with emerging methods for the preclinical assessment of protein therapeutics and new biologic therapeutic modalities , this collective compendium provides a guide to current best practices and new concepts in the field .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the rate of change in selective pressures is one of the main factors that determines the likelihood that populations can adapt to stress conditions .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	generally , the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	however , in systems with high genetic diversity , as happens in rna viruses , mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population , facilitating adaptation .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	in this work , we have propagated an rna bacteriophage ( qβ ) at temperatures higher than the optimum , following different patterns of change .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	we have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes , differing also in the particular selected mutations .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the life - history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the conclusion is that in the bacteriophage qβ , the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	evolution in gradually changing environments has been modeled as a process of adaptation to a moving optimum [ 17 ]

8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	[ 19 ] [ 20 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the lower the rate of change , the smaller the drop in fitness
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the population experiences in each of the environments to which it is exposed .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	this means that the selective pressure under change has a low intensity at any point of the process and adaptation will occur through the selection of beneficial mutations that provide small effects on fitness [ 17 ]
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	[ 18 ]
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	[ 19 ] [ 20 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	since these mutations are relatively abundant [ 21 ]
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	[ 22 ] [ 23 ] , there could be a diversity of accessible pathways for adaptation to gradual changes .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	in contrast to this , rapid environmental changes usually produce strong fitness drops that severely decrease the population size and , thus , the associated genetic diversity [ 24 ]
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	[ 25 ]
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	[ 26 ] [ 27 ] , making it difficult to find the scarce , large effect mutations that would make adaptation possible , unless those mutants already exist in the population , in which case the population bottleneck might help them to fix .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the situation is even harsher when a particular combination of mutations is required for optimal adaptation .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	due to the generally lower number of adaptive solutions to rapid changes , evolution would be more constrained under this condition than when changes take place at a slower rate [ 28 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	additionally , because epistatic interactions among mutations of small effect are weaker [ 29 , 30 ] , it has also been suggested that gradual regimes would allow for populations to reach higher fitness values .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	there are many experimental studies using a variety of biological systems , such as bacteria [ 12 , 31 ] , unicellular algae [ 9 ] , yeasts [ 14,16,32 ] , or viruses [ 13,15,33 ] , and selective pressures , such as antibiotics [ 12,31 ] , heavy metals [ 14,16 ] , new hosts [ 13,15 ] , salt stress [ 32 ] , or changes in temperature [ 33 ] , that have explored the influence of the rate of environmental change on adaptation .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	in good agreement with the predictions of the models , in some studies the rate of population extinction was higher under more rapid environmental changes [ 12,31 - 33 ] due to the strong decline in population sizes and also , in some cases , because the adapted genotypes were only accessible upon a previous sequence of environments .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	this kind of historical contingency can occur when certain mutations that permit survival at high intensity of the selective pressure are deleterious in the absence of other mutations that can only be selected at a lower intensity of the selective pressure [ 12 , 34 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	there are also examples showing that populations evolving under gradual changes reached higher fitness values [ 9 , 13 , 25 ] and/or displayed more genetic diversity among replicate lineages than those evolving under more abrupt changes [ 9 , 12 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	in contrast to this , the results obtained in other studies manifested some discrepancy with the prediction of the models , showing that phenotypes obtained under rapid environmental change were fitter [ 31 , 32 , 35 ] or contained a greater diversity of mutations than those evolving at a slower pace [ 13 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	finally , other studies did not find differences either in the fitness or in the genetic diversity contained in populations that could be attributed to the rate of environmental change [ 14 , 16 , 36 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	altogether , those results suggest that the differences in evolutionary outcomes due to the rate of change in the selective pressures depend on both the biological system - with its particular mutation and replication rates , relevance of epistatic interactions , and underlying distribution of mutational effects - and on the assayed environmental condition .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	in this work , we studied how a temperature increase of fixed magnitude but variable rate influenced evolutionary outcomes in an rna bacteriophage .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	specifically , we used as a model
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the bacteriophage qβ , of the family leviviridae , which infects escherichia coli strains expressing the f pilus that acts as the virus receptor [ 37 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	bacteriophage qβ has an rna genome of positive polarity ( such as poliovirus , foot - and - mouth disease virus , or the coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome ) of 4217 nucleotides that encodes four proteins :
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the a2 protein for bacterial lysis and entry , the coat protein , the a1 protein , which is present in low amounts in the capsid and expressed through incorrect reading of the stop codon of the coat protein , and the replicase that copies the rna genome [ 37 ] .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	as in other rna viruses , replication in qβ proceeds at a high error rate [ 38 ] , giving rise to highly heterogeneous populations that adapt fast .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	the optimal temperature for replication of this virus is 37 • c ( the host temperature ) .
8b27b57e5226ffb254f5d747bf115690e2c73546	much of the difficulty in treating diseases caused by viruses , especially rna viruses , stems from their high evolutionary potential [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] .

ff6e7c70571d00234a94ebb6964d5bff82b053e4	synopsis billions of animals migrate each year .
ff6e7c70571d00234a94ebb6964d5bff82b053e4	to successfully reach their destination , migrants must have evolved an appropriate genetic program and suitable developmental , morphological , physiological , biomechanical , behavioral , and life - history traits .

eb03629185583e8b0a8022835e3849e05d9ed11c	cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed types of surgery .
eb03629185583e8b0a8022835e3849e05d9ed11c	most patients suffer from bilateral cataract and while cataract surgery of only one eye is effective in restoring functional vision , second - eye surgery leads to further improvements in health - related quality of life , and is cost - effective .
eb03629185583e8b0a8022835e3849e05d9ed11c	at present , most patients undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days as recommended in national guidelines , referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery ( dsbcs ) .
eb03629185583e8b0a8022835e3849e05d9ed11c	an alternative procedure involves operating both eyes on the same day , but as separate procedures , known as immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery ( isbcs ) .

3b5ff3bcbc732bd0dfad0a90fa838bfefe54f52a	emerging antibiotic and drug resistances to commonly used anti - neuraminidase agents such as oseltamivir ( tamiflu ) and zanamivir ( relenza ) have highlighted the need to develop new anti - neuraminidase drugs .
3b5ff3bcbc732bd0dfad0a90fa838bfefe54f52a	we obtained a serendipitous complex crystal of the catalytic domain of clostridium perfringens neuraminidase ( cpnani cd ) with 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid ( ches ) as a buffer .
3b5ff3bcbc732bd0dfad0a90fa838bfefe54f52a	here , we report the crystal structure of cpnani cd in complex with ches at 1.24 å resolution .
3b5ff3bcbc732bd0dfad0a90fa838bfefe54f52a	amphipathic ches binds to the catalytic site of cpnani cd similar to the substrate ( neu5ac ) binding site .
3b5ff3bcbc732bd0dfad0a90fa838bfefe54f52a	the 2aminoethanesulfonic acid moiety and cyclohexyl groups of ches interact with the cluster of three arginine residues and with the hydrophobic pocket of the cpnani cd catalytic site .
3b5ff3bcbc732bd0dfad0a90fa838bfefe54f52a	in addition , a structural comparison with other bacterial and human neuraminidases suggests that ches could serve as a scaffold for the development of new anti - neuraminidase agents targeting cpnani.

2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	the covid-19 outbreak is a global pandemic with community circulation in many countries , including the united states , with confirmed cases in all states .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	the course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	here , we examine information - seeking responses to the first covid-19 case public announcement in a state .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	using an event study framework for all us states , we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	however , the elevated level of attention is short - lived , even though the initial announcements are followed by increasingly strong policy measures .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	specifically , searches for " coronavirus " increased by about 36 % ( 95 % ci : 27 to 44 % ) on the day immediately after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	we find that people respond to the first report of covid-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about covid-19 , as measured by searches for coronavirus , coronavirus symptoms , and hand sanitizer .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	on the other hand , searches for information regarding community - level policies ( e.g. , quarantine , school closures , testing ) or personal health strategies ( e.g. , masks , grocery delivery , over - the - counter medications ) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	these results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic , and more - elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	further analysis should track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information .

2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	google trends | information t he first confirmed case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in the united states occurred in washington state on january 21 , 2020 .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	since then , the virus has spread across the country ( 1 , 2 ) .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	there are confirmed cases in every state , and the vast majority are not connected to international travel ( 3 ) , indicating that the virus had been circulating for several weeks before the first positive test ( 4 , 5 ) .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	slowing the transmission of the virus will help reduce the burden of the disease , save lives , and reduce strain on the health care system ( 4 , 6 ) .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	in the absence of a vaccine , the main strategies for reducing transmission involve sanitation and handwashing , disciplined social distancing , quarantines , and school and workplace closures ( 6 ) .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	these nonpharmaceutical interventions ( npis ) are effective and powerful ways to control transmission ( 7 ) , as shown by earlier epidemics ( 8) and the steady decline of covid-19 cases in china ( 2 ) .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	to be successful , npis require people to undertake behavioral changes that may be personally costly .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	this is particularly true in countries with deeply rooted norms about personal freedom and reluctance to impose mandatory policies .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	in settings where restrictions on the free movement of residents are less strictly enforced , it is especially critical for public officials to know whether and for how long statements from leaders motivate individuals to efficiently seek and absorb information , as officials put their communication strategies in place .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	such coordinated actions are needed at the first signs of community spreading and can not be guided through traditional polling methods , which take too long .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	because the extent of the epidemic is likely to be underestimated at this stage , it is crucial to know how much the early case announcements induce heightened collective attention and information - seeking behavior .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	to provide rapid evidence to inform policy making , we use internet search data in an event study design to examine how collective attention and information - seeking behaviors respond to state government announcements of first covid-19 cases .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	we highlight changes in search patterns occurring in the days leading up to and following first case announcements in a state ( 1 , 2 ) .

2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	1 depicts the event study estimates of the effects of initial announcements on overall coronavirus search .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	searches for " coronavirus " increased by about 36 % ( 95 % ci : 27 to 44 % ) on the day immediately after the announcement but quickly decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	( fig . 1 ) .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	there was no observable trend in the search behavior in the days leading up to the announcements , suggesting the first " local " case indeed heightened the collective attention to the pandemic .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	however , the increased level of information seeking faded within 2 wk , even though many announcements of school closures or other mitigation strategies followed , suggesting that increased attention is only short - lived .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	this is consistent with no observable trend in the sense of urgency prior to the local announcement .

2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	4 ) narratives that undermine public responses .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	news of the first covid-19 case in a state leads to a 52 % increase in searches for " coronavirus symptoms " but does not increase searches for coronavirus treatment options .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	the second row shows searches for " hand sanitizer " increasing 35 % immediately after first case announcements , and , unlike in the previous two cases , the search activity remains high for the remainder of the observable period .
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	however , the announcements do not induce searches for nearby coronavirus testing opportunities , at least in the period under study .

c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	background :
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	simple phenomenological growth models can be useful for estimating transmission parameters and forecasting epidemic trajectories .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	however , most existing phenomenological growth models only support singlepeak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	methods : we develop and apply a novel sub - epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	we describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse - scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub - epidemics at finer scales .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	we evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets : severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in singapore , plague in madagascar , and the ongoing ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	( drc ) and four performance metrics .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	results :
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	the sub - epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short - term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score ( mis ) and the coverage of the 95 % prediction interval .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	for example , we demonstrate how the sub - epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the sars outbreak in singapore .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	moreover , in short - term sequential forecasts , the sub - epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak , which was not possible using the simple growth models .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	furthermore , our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the ebola epidemic in drc follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub - epidemics .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	conclusions :
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	our findings highlight how overlapping sub - epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics , including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	this observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion , rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled , they could also give a false positive , or negative , impression of the impact from public health interventions .
c95771649886404cfec24c5c139e851c614e632b	these preliminary results using sub - epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub - epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	an immune - adherence hemagglutination ( iaha ) method for coronavirus 229e antibody determination has been developed both for diagnosis of recent infections and for detection of long - past infections .

c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	( iha ) tests .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	the iaha method has been shown to be as sensitive as the cf , nt , and iha tests in detecting cases of acute 229e infection .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	however , in a seroepidemiological survey of 343 healthy people of all ages , iaiia detected 229e antibody in 254 individuals ( 74.0 % ) , nt in 166 ( 48.3 % ) , iha in 89 ( 25.y% ) , and cf in 30 ( 8.7 % ) .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	a study of the prevalence of coronavirus 229e iaha antibody in the different age groups has shown that during the second decade of life nearly 100 % of the population acquire this type of antibody , whereas only 50 % are positive at the end of the first decade .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	in the older age groups , the high frequency of c f antibody ( " marker " of recent infection ) indirectly confirms the high rate of 229e reinfections and the nonprotective nature of iaha antibody .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	c f titer 2 1 : 8 in 90 % of cases corresponded to iaiia titers 2 1 : 64 .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	however , sera with iaha titers of 2 1 : 128 were often cf - negative .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	recent 2298 infections ( or reinfections ) , as determined by the presence of cf antibody , were more frequent in april - may than in october - november .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	three cases of acute infection showing 229e seroconversion ( two adults and one child ) were observed during the winter - spring season .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	iaha appears to be the test of choice for seroepidemiological surveys .
c4bfedbabccb1896604048b54cc698b06b652913	epidemiological surveys carried out in the united states [ 1 - 31 , england [ 4 ] , and brazil [ 5 ] indicate that coronavirus 229e infections are worldwide .

5838b6b435db4fdcbc39371939b8a691cf6868d8	in recent years , transgenic technology has become more versatile and sophisticated , mainly because of the incorporation of recombinase - mediated conditional expression and targeted insertion , site - speci fi c endonuclease - mediated genome editing , sirna - mediated gene knockdown , various inducible gene expression systems , and fl uorescent protein marking and tracking techniques .
5838b6b435db4fdcbc39371939b8a691cf6868d8	site - speci fi c recombinases ( such as phic31 ) and engineered endonucleases ( such as zfn and talen )
5838b6b435db4fdcbc39371939b8a691cf6868d8	have signi fi cantly enhanced our ability to target transgenes into speci fi c genomic loci , but currently a great majority of transgenic mouse lines are continuingly being created using the conventional random insertion method .
5838b6b435db4fdcbc39371939b8a691cf6868d8	a major challenge for using this conventional method is that the genomic environment at the integration site has a substantial in fl uence on the expression of the transgene .
5838b6b435db4fdcbc39371939b8a691cf6868d8	although our understanding of such chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive , adhering to some general guidelines can signi fi cantly increase the odds of successful transgene expression .

ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	this study aims to provide an accessible and dynamic estimate method to project the covid-19 trend and hopefully it will help inform policymakers to allocate the needed medical equipment and supplies for saving more lives .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	a set of newly developed pandemic projection measures ( ppm ) had been successfully applied to project daily new cases across countries .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	during the development , numerous trial and error iterations had been performed and then improved with live data .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	the procedures and computations for the ppm including uphill index ( uhi ) , downhill indices ( dhi ) , and error band projection ( ebp ) estimates were explained and discussed along with graphical projections .

ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	the results indicated that with the ppm estimations , the daily projections for the future trend were robust to reflect the most plausibility , since the ppm can be updated frequently .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	with the most up - to - date predictions , governments should be able to monitor the values of uhi and dhi for making a better decision for " flattening the curve " .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	based on the empirical data , policymakers should pay more attentions for the following two scenarios :

ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	when expecting an apex of the outbreak , the uhi is higher than 1.20 ; and b )
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	after passing a peak day , the dhi is still larger than 0.925 .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	the applications of the ppm estimates are not designed for a one - time projection rather than updated frequently to improve the prediction precisions .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	with the same concepts from the ppm computations , the peak day and the number of new deaths could be predictable if more data are collected .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	like many country leaders saying , " we will win the battle of coronavirus pandemic " , the author hopes to use this easily applicable estimate method to save more lives and to win .
ba1e75d2198f3047cc8509d8a70caf9402e807f8	the results , currently presented with the data on april 16 and 17 , 2020 , were only used to explain how to apply the ppm estimates for predictions .

fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus ( sads - cov ) , a novel coronavirus , was first discovered in southern china in january 2017 and caused a large scale outbreak of fatal diarrheal disease in piglets .
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	here , we conducted a retrospective investigation of 236 samples from 45 swine farms with a clinical history of diarrheal disease to evaluate the emergence and the distribution of sads - cov in pigs in china .
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	our results suggest that sads - cov has emerged in china at least since august 2016 .
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	meanwhile , we detected a prevalence of sads - cov ( 43.53 % ) , porcine deltacoronavirus ( 8.83 % ) , porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus ( pedv ) ( 78.25 % ) , rotavirus ( 21.77 % ) , and transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( 0 % ) , and we also found the co - infection of sads - cov and pedv occurred most frequently with the rate of 17.65 % .
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	we screened and obtained two new complete genomes ,
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	five n and five s genes of sads - cov. phylogenetic analysis based on these sequences revealed that all sads - cov sequences in this study clustered with previously reported sads - cov strains to form a well defined branch that grouped with the bat coronavirus hku2 strains .
fd504c3894072f5974f805be10adfb9eb6b2dbed	this study is the first retrospective investigation for sads - cov and provides the epidemiological information of this new virus in china , which highlights the urgency to develop effective measures to control sads - cov.

318a5c6daa222c6b300d42168f20a53e14a6e33a	in 2020 , the initial covid-19 lockdowns in china overlapped with week 3 of the chinese new year ( cny ) holiday , and an asian outflow event .
318a5c6daa222c6b300d42168f20a53e14a6e33a	thus , movement of the chinese populace from city to city was already greatly reduced by the time of the lrt episode , although the reductions in industrial output are less clear .
318a5c6daa222c6b300d42168f20a53e14a6e33a	we found no 2 column concentrations were reduced by 24 % during the cny week 3 this year compared to previous years .
318a5c6daa222c6b300d42168f20a53e14a6e33a	the attenuated transport event arrived to northern taiwan with a pm 2.5 concentration less than 45 μg m -3 and most often less than 35 μg m

318a5c6daa222c6b300d42168f20a53e14a6e33a	modeling of the lrt event with 100 % emission and reduced emission scenarios , revealed emissions in china were approximately 50 % less than normal periods .
318a5c6daa222c6b300d42168f20a53e14a6e33a	due to the length of the episode and the significant reduction in emissions , taiwan avoided a pm 2.5 surplus of 19.2 μg m -3 on average during the episode , equivalent to a 0.5 μg m -3 reduction for the whole 3-month winter season .
318a5c6daa222c6b300d42168f20a53e14a6e33a	employing the 100 % emission model scenario and scaling up to the average episode hours each winter , the pm 2.5 surplus delivered via plumes on the northeast monsoon is equivalent to a 0.5 μg m -3 surplus for the whole year .

e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	background and objectives chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine has recently been the subject of intense debate regarding its potential antiviral activity against sars - cov-2 , the etiologic agent of covid-19 .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	some report possible curative effects ; others do not .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	therefore , the objective of this study was to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients using mathematical modeling .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	methods
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	to shed some light on this controversial topic , we simulated hydroxychloroquine - based interventions on virus / host cell dynamics using a basic system of previously published differential equations .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	mathematical modeling was implemented using python programming language v 3.7 .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	results
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	according to mathematical modeling , hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak and viral clearance if the drug is administered early enough ( i.e. , when the virus is still confined within the pharyngeal cavity ) .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	the effects of chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine may be fully explained only when also considering the capacity of this drug to increase the death rate of sars - cov-2-infected cells , in this case by enhancing the cell - mediated immune response .
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	conclusions
e48ebaa376d94cc8c1f3170401eeb8d8ba0f9d2b	these considerations may not only be applied to chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine but may have more general implications for development of anti - covid-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies through an increased death rate of the infected cells .
b9bda4ac723da46f0a97cb515f56fcdb1588f162	monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) against two major structural proteins of the cell - adapted mebus strain of bovine coronavirus ( bcv - l9 ) were produced and characterized .
b9bda4ac723da46f0a97cb515f56fcdb1588f162	seven mabs reacted with the peplomeric glycoprotein , gploo / s , while three mabs reacted with the nucleoprotein p53 / n in western blot analysis of bcv polypeptides .
b9bda4ac723da46f0a97cb515f56fcdb1588f162	mabs to gploo / s reacted with discontinuous epitopes of gploo / s in westerns under mild but not under standard denaturing conditions .
b9bda4ac723da46f0a97cb515f56fcdb1588f162	in contrast , mabs to p53 / n reacted in both types of westerns , and those epitopes were thus continuous .
b9bda4ac723da46f0a97cb515f56fcdb1588f162	mabs to p53 / n failed to neutralize bcv infectivity , while 4 mabs to gploo / s neutralized bcv effectively .
b9bda4ac723da46f0a97cb515f56fcdb1588f162	cross reactivity of mabs to gploo / s specified by five virulent wild - type strains and two high passage , cell - culture - adapted strains in mildly denaturing westerns and neutralization
b9bda4ac723da46f0a97cb515f56fcdb1588f162	assays indicated that two epitopes were conserved in all seven strains , while two epitopes of the avirulent strains were not detected in the wild - type strains .

6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	the etiology of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system remains unknown and likely involves a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggering factors .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	given that exposure to numerous infectious pathogens occurs during childhood , and that some viral infections can lead to neurodegeneration and demyelination , it is conceivable that some viruses may act as triggering factors in neuropathogenesis .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	we have previously shown that the prototype oc43 strain of the common cold - associated human respiratory coronavirus has the capacity to infect human neuronal and glial cells and does persist in human brains .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	moreover , it has neuroinvasive properties in susceptible balb / c mice , where it leads to a chronic encephalitis with accompanying disabilities .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	here , we show that mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein , reproducibly acquired during viral persistence in human neural cell cultures , led to a drastically modified virus - induced neuropathology in balb / c mice , characterized by flaccid paralysis and demyelination .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	even though infection by both mutated and wild - type viruses led to neuroinflammation , the modified neuropathogenesis induced by the mutated virus was associated with increased viral spread and significantly more cd4 + and cd8 + t - lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system , as well as significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin ( il)-6 and the chemokine ccl2 ( monocyte chemoattractant protein [ mcp]-1 ) .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	moreover , recombinant virus harboring the s glycoprotein mutations retained its neurotropism , productively infecting neurons .
6f76a22d8bd24d8b1cf819890a64c013be12c173	therefore , interaction of a human respiratory coronavirus with the central nervous system may modulate virus and host factors resulting in a modified neuropathogenesis in genetically susceptible individuals .

33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	airflows induced by door opening motion and healthcare worker passage can , however , transport the potentially pathogen laden air across the doorway .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	in this study airflow patterns across the isolation room doorway induced by the operation of single hinged and sliding doors with simulated human passage were examined .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	smoke visualizations demonstrated that the hinged door opening generated a greater flow across the doorway than the sliding door .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	tracer gas measurements showed that the examined ventilation rates ( 6 and 12 air changes per hour ) had only a small effect on the air volume exchange across the doorway with the hinged door .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	the results were more variable with the sliding door .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	supply - exhaust flow rate differential reduced the door motion - induced air transfer significantly with both door types .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	the experiments showed that the passage induced substantial air volume transport through the doorway with both door types .
33b8f39560a149b33a7ee048291af794cf0aa8a8	however , overall , the sliding door performed better in all tested scenarios , because the door - opening motion itself generated relatively smaller air volume exchange across the doorway , and hence should be the preferred choice in the design of isolation rooms .

4a86a65703f8585535ef011952aea59ba1271c3f	the primary outcome was incidence of incisional surgical site infection ( ssi ) at 30 days post - operatively .
4a86a65703f8585535ef011952aea59ba1271c3f	secondary outcomes included superficial and deep ssi , skin dehiscence , fascial dehiscence and length of stay .
4a86a65703f8585535ef011952aea59ba1271c3f	a total of 2182 publications were identified , of which , following review of titles , abstracts and full texts , five studies met the criteria for inclusion .
4a86a65703f8585535ef011952aea59ba1271c3f	across these studies , 467 patients were randomised to npwt and 464 to standard dressings .
4a86a65703f8585535ef011952aea59ba1271c3f	overall ssi rate was 18.6 % ( n = 87/467 ) versus 23.9 % ( n = 111/464 ) in the npwt and standard dressing groups , respectively ( odds ratio 0.71 , 95 % ci 0.52 - 0.99 , p

1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( prrs ) viruses are a major cause of disease and economic loss in pigs worldwide .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	high genetic diversity among prrsv strains is problematic for successful disease control by vaccination .

1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	( vacv ) vaccines were developed in order to improve protection against heterologous prrsv strains .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	methods :
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	piglets were primed and boosted with gp5-mosaic dna vaccine and recombinant gp5-mosaic vacv ( rgp5-mosaic vacv ) , respectively .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	pigs vaccinated with rgp5-wt ( vr2332 ) dna and rgp5-wt vacv , or empty vector dna and empty vacv respectively , served as controls .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	virus challenge was given to separate groups of vaccinated pigs with vr2332 or mn184c. necropsies were performed 14 days after challenge .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	results : vaccination with the gp5-mosaic - based vaccines resulted in cellular reactivity and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies to both vr2332 and mn184c prrsv strains .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	in contrast , vaccination of animals with the gp5-wt vaccines induced responses only to vr2332 .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	furthermore , vaccination with the gp5-mosaic based vaccines resulted in protection against challenge with two heterologous virus strains , as demonstrated by the significantly lower viral loads in serum , tissues , porcine alveolar macrophages ( pams ) , and bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) fluids , and less severe lung lesions after challenge with either mn184c or vr2332 , which have only 85 % identity .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	in contrast , significant protection by the gp5-wt based vaccines was only achieved against the vr2332 strain .
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	conclusions :
1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd	gp5-mosaic vaccines , using a dna - prime / vacv boost regimen , conferred protection in pigs against heterologous viruses .

36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	several demographic , environmental , and health care trends , as reviewed in this report , are combining to make it likely that the threat of id will increase in coming years .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	two factors are largely responsible for this trend : first , the constantly changing nature and range of pathogens to which we are exposed and , secondly , the demographic changes occurring in the community , which affect our resistance to infection .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	this report reviews the evidence base related to the impact of hand hygiene in reducing transmission of id in the home and community .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	the report focuses on developed countries , most particularly north america and europe .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	it also evaluates the use of alcohol - based hygiene procedures as an alternative to , or in conjunction with , handwashing .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	the report compiles data from intervention studies and considers it alongside risk modeling approaches ( both qualitative and quantitative ) based on microbiologic data .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	the main conclusions are as follows : ( 1 )
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	hand hygiene is a key component of good hygiene practice in the home and community and can produce significant benefits in terms of reducing the incidence of infection , most particularly gastrointestinal infections but also respiratory tract and skin infections .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	( 2 ) decontamination of hands can be carried out either by handwashing with soap or by use of waterless hand sanitizers , which reduce contamination on hands by removal or by killing the organisms in situ .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	the health impact of hand hygiene within a given community can be increased by using products and procedures , either alone or in sequence , that maximize the log reduction of both bacteria and viruses on hands .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	( 3 )
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	the impact of hand hygiene in reducing id risks could be increased by convincing people to apply hand hygiene procedures correctly ( eg , wash their hands correctly ) and at the correct time .
36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557	( 4 ) to optimize health benefits , promotion of hand hygiene should be accompanied by hygiene education and should also involve promotion of other aspects of hygiene .

8cb564e5d988f1dbf5de5636cb0f15521e3eaa6b	other acute infections causing purpuric lesions at the extremities were negative in all patients .
8cb564e5d988f1dbf5de5636cb0f15521e3eaa6b	skin lesion biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was made in two cases and was consistent with chilblain .
8cb564e5d988f1dbf5de5636cb0f15521e3eaa6b	pcr - assay on skin lesion biopsy for parvovirus b19 , mycoplasma pneumoniae and sars - cov-2 was performed in a patient and resulted negative .
8cb564e5d988f1dbf5de5636cb0f15521e3eaa6b	we identified common precipitating and risk factors : physical ( cold and wet extremities , low bmi ) , cold and wet indoor and outdoor environment , behaviors , habits , lifestyle .

3f816a1cbb4ad735a54792bf22fb55fe51b849c2	this paper presents a two - stage machine learning ( ml ) model to predict the arrival time of in - process control ( ipc ) samples at the quality testing laboratories of a chemical company .
3f816a1cbb4ad735a54792bf22fb55fe51b849c2	the model was developed using three iterations of the cross - industry standard process for data mining ( crisp - dm ) methodology , each focusing on a different regression approach .
3f816a1cbb4ad735a54792bf22fb55fe51b849c2	to reduce the ml analyst effort , an automated machine learning ( automl ) was adopted during the modeling stage of crisp - dm .
3f816a1cbb4ad735a54792bf22fb55fe51b849c2	the automl was set to select the best among six distinct state - of - the - art regression algorithms .
3f816a1cbb4ad735a54792bf22fb55fe51b849c2	using recent real - world data , the three main regression approaches were compared , showing that the proposed two - stage ml model is competitive and provides interesting predictions to support the laboratory management decisions ( e.g. , preparation of testing instruments ) .
3f816a1cbb4ad735a54792bf22fb55fe51b849c2	in particular , the proposed method can accurately predict 70 % of the examples under a tolerance of 4 time units .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	our ability to respond appropriately to infectious diseases is enhanced by identifying differences in the potential for transmitting infection between individuals .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	here , we identify epidemiological traits of self - limited infections ( i.e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying 0vr eff v1 )
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	that correlate with transmissibility .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	our analysis is based on a branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios , including the transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) in the arabian peninsula , measles in north america , pre - eradication smallpox in europe , and human monkeypox in the democratic republic of the congo .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	when applied to chain size data for mers - cov transmission before 2014 , our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control , there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that r eff has declined with time .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	meanwhile , chain size data for measles in the united states and canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in r eff , suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs , as well as contact tracing procedures , may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases , and provides a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of control interventions .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	human monkeypox , on the other hand , does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans , primary cases , or secondary cases , which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	lastly , we evaluate surveillance requirements for detecting a change in the human - to - human transmission of monkeypox since the cessation of cross - protective smallpox vaccination .
a034fc1a3e926d0e12339678c32e892c37f514cb	our studies lay the foundation for future investigations regarding how infection source , vaccination status or other putative transmissibility traits may affect self - limited transmission .
3bd5e582f0bad1859d9f86168684194221a93c50	since pascal introduced the idea of mathematical probability in the 17th century discussions of uncertainty and " rational " belief have been dogged by philosophical and technical disputes .
3bd5e582f0bad1859d9f86168684194221a93c50	furthermore , the last quarter century has seen an explosion of new questions and ideas , stimulated by developments in the computer and cognitive sciences .
3bd5e582f0bad1859d9f86168684194221a93c50	competing ideas about probability are often driven by different intuitions about the nature of belief that arise from the needs of different domains ( e.g. , economics , management theory , engineering , medicine , the life sciences etc ) .
3bd5e582f0bad1859d9f86168684194221a93c50	taking medicine as our focus we develop three lines of argument ( historical , practical and cognitive ) that suggest that traditional views of probability can not accommodate all the competing demands and diverse constraints that arise in complex real - world domains .
3bd5e582f0bad1859d9f86168684194221a93c50	a model of uncertain reasoning based on a form of logical argumentation appears to unify many diverse ideas .
3bd5e582f0bad1859d9f86168684194221a93c50	the model has precursors in informal discussions of argumentation due to toulmin , and the notion of logical probability advocated by keynes , but recent developments in artificial intelligence and cognitive science suggest ways of resolving epistemological and technical issues that they could not address .

49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	nipah virus ( niv ) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus which encodes two surface glycoproteins : the receptor - binding protein g and the fusion protein
49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	f. as for all paramyxoviruses , proteolytic activation of the niv - f protein is an indispensable prerequisite for viral infectivity .
49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	interestingly , proteolytic activation of niv - f differs principally from other paramyxoviruses with respect to protease usage ( cathepsins instead of trypsin - or furin - like proteases ) , and the subcellular localization where cleavage takes place ( endosomes instead of golgi or plasma membrane ) .
49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	to allow efficient f protein activation needed for productive virus replication and cell - to - cell fusion , the niv - f cytoplasmic tail contains a classical tyrosinebased endocytosis signal ( y 525 rsl ) that we have shown earlier to be needed for f uptake and proteolytic activation .
49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	in this report , we furthermore revealed that an intact endocytosis signal alone is not sufficient for full bioactivity .
49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	the very c - terminus of the cytoplasmic tail is needed in addition .
49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	deletions of more than four residues did not affect f uptake or endosomal cleavage but downregulated the surface expression , likely by delaying the intracellular trafficking through endosomal - recycling compartments .
49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da	given that the niv - f cytoplasmic tail is needed for timely and correct intracellular trafficking , endosomal cleavage and fusion activity , the influence of tail truncations on niv - mediated cell - to - cell fusion and on pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is discussed .

793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	ebolavirus ( ebov ) and marburgvirus ( marv ) that compose the filovirus family of negative strand rna viruses infect a broad range of mammalian cells .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	recent studies indicate that cellular entry of this family of viruses requires a series of cellular protein interactions and molecular mechanisms , some of which are unique to filoviruses and others are commonly used by all viral glycoproteins .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	details of this entry pathway are highlighted here .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	virus entry into cells is initiated by the interaction of the viral glycoprotein 1 subunit ( gp 1 ) with both adherence factors and one or more receptors on the surface of host cells .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	on epithelial cells , we recently demonstrated that tim-1 serves as a receptor for this family of viruses , but the cell surface receptors in other cell types remain unidentified .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	upon receptor binding , the virus is internalized into endosomes primarily via macropinocytosis , but perhaps by other mechanisms as well .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	within the acidified endosome , the heavily glycosylated gp 1 is cleaved to a smaller form by the low ph - dependent cellular proteases cathepsin l and b , exposing residues in the receptor binding site ( rbs ) .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	details of the molecular events following cathepsin - dependent trimming of gp 1 are currently incomplete ; however , the processed gp 1 specifically interacts with endosomal / lysosomal membranes that contain the niemann pick c1 ( npc1 ) protein and expression of npc1 is required for productive infection , suggesting that gp / npc1 interactions may be an important late step in the entry process .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	additional events such as further gp 1 processing and/or reducing events may also be required to generate a fusion - ready form of the glycoprotein .
793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1	once this has been achieved , sequences in the filovirus gp 2 subunit mediate viral / cellular membrane fusion via mechanisms similar to those previously described for other enveloped viruses .

6eb5dc7405ff754df5fa10b64a7dba74b2be84d7	from the beginning of the year 2020 , the world was affected by a coronavirus disease pandemic , caused by sars - cov-2 , leading to a shortage of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) at a global level , and thus generating exposure of health professionals to this extremely contagious virus .

6eb5dc7405ff754df5fa10b64a7dba74b2be84d7	the authors produced a face shield in abs , in a total time of 3 hours and 44 minutes .
6eb5dc7405ff754df5fa10b64a7dba74b2be84d7	thus , the model presented proved to be feasible , at a low cost , adding to the list of possibilities to produce inputs necessary to maintain the fight against this epidemic .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	disease transmission and behavior change are both fundamentally social phenomena .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	behavior change can have profound consequences for disease transmission , and epidemic conditions can favor the more rapid adoption of behavioral innovations .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	we analyze a simple model 3 of coupled behavior - change and infection in a structured population characterized by homophily and outgroup aversion .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and leads to bifurcation when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	when the rates of adoption differ by 6 group , high outgroup aversion causes the later - adopting group to have a lower equilibrium adoption fraction , even when the behavior is highly desirable .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	when disease dynamics are coupled to the behavior - adoption model , a wide variety of dynamics are possible .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	homophily can either 9 increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and r 0 for the infection .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	when r 0
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	≈ 1 and homophily is strong in the second group , it can be protective for this group .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	however , when r 0 1 , we find that strong homophily in 12 the second group , together with outgroup aversion , can lead to a much larger epidemic in that group .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	similarly , if the first group is homophilic and the second is not , the second group will have a larger epidemic .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce a " second wave " in 15 the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	in general , adding outgroup aversion to a population characterized by homophily can result in paradoxical failure to adopt behavior that is protective from infection .
7c162e5b8935eb7a2802ac83d9f8bc5d3dc79802	these simple models reveal complex dynamics 18 that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarized populations such as the united states .

4b6924e8a47cd58844905f4ce2a134e44783d68b	method :
4b6924e8a47cd58844905f4ce2a134e44783d68b	an anonymous computer - assisted telephone interview survey was conducted in spain in december 2009 and february 2010 .
4b6924e8a47cd58844905f4ce2a134e44783d68b	respondents were asked about their perceptions of influenza a ( h1n1 ) virus and the preventive measures adopted .
4b6924e8a47cd58844905f4ce2a134e44783d68b	factors associated with the adoption of preventive measures were assessed by logistic regression analyses .

879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	adenoviruses are double - strained dna viruses found in a great number of vertebrates , including humans .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	in order to understand their transmission dynamics , it is crucial , even from a human health perspective , to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	bats are important reservoirs for adenoviruses , and here we use the results of recent screenings in western europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting adenoviruses , taking into account their phylogenetic relationships .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	across species , we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses across bat species .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	contrary to other more stable mating strategies ( e.g. harems ) , swarming could hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	alternatively , bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the iberian species pipistrellus pygmaeus , p. kuhlii and nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter , males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females , due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	as a general trend across species , we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances for two of the three studied bat species ( p. pygmaeus and p.kuhlii ) .
879387ff0282d3823d01dded6b50b383e1741342	these results increase our knowledge about the transmission mechanisms of adenoviruses .

40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	to date , no specific drug for covid-19 has been developed .
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	thus we performed this randomized , open - label , controlled clinical trial ( chictr2000029853 ) in china .
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	a total of 20 mild and common covid-19 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive azvudine and symptomatic treatment ( fnc group ) , or standard antiviral and symptomatic treatments ( control group ) .
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	the mean times of the first nucleic acid negative conversion ( nanc ) of 10 patients in the fnc group and 10 patients in the control group were 2.60 (
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	sd 0.97 ; range 1 - 4 ) days and 5.60 ( sd 3.06 ; range 2 - 13 ) days , respectively ( p=0.08 ) .
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	the mean times of the first nanc of 4 newly diagnosed subjects in the fnc group and 10 subjects in the control group were 2.50 ( sd 1.00 ; range 2 - 4 ) days and 9.80 ( sd 4.73 ; range 3 - 19 ) days , respectively ( starting from the initial treatment ) ( p= 0.01 ) .
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	no adverse events occurred in the fnc group , while 3 adverse events occurred in the control group ( p=0.06 ) .
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	the preliminary results showed that fnc treatment in the mild and common covid-19 may shorten the nanc time versus standard antiviral treatment .
40412ceb23f361c42132c4dd5329f412fbc3a81a	therefore , clinical trials of fnc treating covid-19 with larger sample size are warranted .

3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a	dna sequences seen in the normal character - based representation appear to have a formidable mixing of the four nucleotides without any apparent order .
3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a	nucleotide frequencies and distributions in the sequences have been studied extensively , since the simple rule given by chargaff almost a century ago that equates the total number of purines to the pyrimidines in a duplex dna sequence .
3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a	while it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a dna sequence , graphical representations may provide a clue .
3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a	these novel representations of dna sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures .
3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a	we report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra - purine and intra - pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales .
3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a	from this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics , perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the dna sequences .
3aeb264d986c987ced699cb2c711eb022b697d5a	such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron - late phenomena .

7d568619357cdaea08773e7d5f19025c5abbaa3d	real - time rt - pcr assays were developed to test fecal samples and to compare the prevalence and viral load in relation to health status , farms of origin and age groups .
7d568619357cdaea08773e7d5f19025c5abbaa3d	the results showed that pastv4 ( 70.4 % ) was the dominant virus species , followed by pkov ( 56.7 % ) , pcv2 ( 42.2 % ) , gcrv ( 3 % ) and garv ( 0.9 % ) .
7d568619357cdaea08773e7d5f19025c5abbaa3d	diarrheic pigs had a higher viral load of pastv4 in the nursery and growing - finishing groups .
7d568619357cdaea08773e7d5f19025c5abbaa3d	rotaviruses were mainly detected in diarrheic pigs , whereas pcv2 was more often detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheic pigs , suggesting that most pcv2 infections were subclinical .
7d568619357cdaea08773e7d5f19025c5abbaa3d	pastv4 , pcv2 and pkov were considered ubiquitous in the european pig livestock and co - infections among them were frequent , independently of the disease status , in contrast to a low prevalence of classical rotavirus infections .
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	the aim of this review is to examine the causes , pathophysiology and experimental models of noninfectious pharyngitis ( sore throat ) .
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	introduction
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	the causes of sore throat can be infectious ( viruses , bacteria , and fungi ) or non - infectious , although the relative proportion of each is not well documented .
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	methods
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	a pubmed database search was performed for studies of non - infectious sore throat .
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	results and conclusions non - infectious causes of sore throat include : physico - chemical factors , such as smoking , snoring , shouting , tracheal intubation , medications , or concomitant illness ; and environmental factors including indoor and outdoor air pollutants , temperature and humidity , and hazardous or occupational irritants .
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	the pathophysiology underlying non - infectious sore throat is largely uncharacterised , although neurogenic inflammation looks to be a promising candidate .
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	it is likely that there will be individual disposition factors or the coincidence of more than one irritant with possible - up to now unknown - interactions between them .
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	therefore , experimental models with defined conditions and objective endpoints are needed .
e1dd5b5b1884508b0e49421388eb658f9f9949e1	a new model using cold dry air to directly induce pharyngeal irritation in humans , with pharyngeal lavage to measure biomarkers , may provide a useful tool for the study of mechanisms and treatment of non - infectious sore throat .

183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	viral proteins of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus ( pedv ) were extracted from the cytoplasm of infected vero cells using hypotonic conditions and a non - ionic detergent .
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	both the ph and the nac1 concentration of the extraction buffer were varied in attempts to increase the solubility of the virion spike glycoproteins ( s - protein ) and of the nucleocapsid proteins ( n - protein ) .
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	monoclonal antibodies , hyperimmune sera and convalescent pig sera were used to identify and monitor these proteins by immunoprecipitation and western blots .
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	the solubility of the s - protein was optimal at ph 4 , whereas that of the n - protein was optimal at ph 9 .
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	consequently , it was possible to enrich for either s - protein or n - protein ; increases in the nac !
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	concentration of the buffer were of no advantage in this respect .
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	enriched preparations of the s - protein and n - protein were used as elisa antigen for the s - elisa and n - elisa , respectively .
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	the s - elisa proved to be the more effective of the two immunoassays .
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	antibodies against s - protein remained detectable for longer periods of time than anti - n - protein antibodies in the sera of pedv - infected pigs .
183adf685e8679d1deeb0e7ea78101668b63f290	using this elisa of increased sensitivity , it was observed that only a small number of farms in switzerland had been infected with pedv .

7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	acute exacerbations are significant events in the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	modern diagnostic techniques have revealed an infectious cause for the majority of exacerbations .
7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	common respiratory viruses contribute to 25%-50 % of exacerbations .
7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	detection of viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples has become the preferred method to study viral exacerbations instead of viral cultures and serologic examination .
7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	clinical application of such molecular detection requires additional studies to clarify interpretation of a positive result .
7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	bacteria account for 25%-50 % of exacerbations .
7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	studies comparing molecular detection of bacteria in sputum with conventional culture techniques have shown that a substantial proportion of bacteria are not detected by the latter method .
7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	however , as with molecular viral detection , clinical application of molecular bacterial diagnosis requires additional studies .
7fdc6bde1e4513dff06ebb8794348c4e4f9f4f13	although still faced with several challenges and requiring additional development , it is quite likely that molecular methods will become the preferred methods for determining the etiology of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
108ebac20ee26fd05a2ba7ad43523957c34d871e	the outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) epidemic in 2003 resulted in unprecedented impacts on people 's daily life .
108ebac20ee26fd05a2ba7ad43523957c34d871e	one of the most significant impacts to people is the fear of contacting the sars virus while engaging daily routine activity .
108ebac20ee26fd05a2ba7ad43523957c34d871e	here we use data from daily underground ridership in taipei city and daily reported new sars cases in taiwan to model the dynamics of the public fear of the sars virus during the wax and wane of the sars period .
108ebac20ee26fd05a2ba7ad43523957c34d871e	we found that for each reported new sars case there is an immediate loss of about 1200 underground ridership ( the fresh fear ) .
108ebac20ee26fd05a2ba7ad43523957c34d871e	these daily loss rates dissipate to the following days with an e - folding time of about 28 days , reflecting the public perception on the risk of contacting sars virus when traveling with the underground system ( the residual fear ) .
108ebac20ee26fd05a2ba7ad43523957c34d871e	about 50 % of daily ridership was lost during the peak of the 2003 sars period , compared with the loss of 80 % daily ridership during the closure of the underground system after typhoon nari , the loss of 50 - 70 % ridership due to the closure of the governmental offices and schools during typhoon periods , and the loss of 60 % daily ridership during chinese new year holidays .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	background :
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) caused multiple outbreaks .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	such outbreaks increase economic and infection control burdens .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	we studied the infection control influence of mers - cov using a hospital - based analysis .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	methods :
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	our hospital had 17 positive and 82 negative cases of mers - cov between april 1 , 2013 , and june 3 , 2013 .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	the study evaluated the impact of these cases on the use of gloves , surgical masks , n95 respirators , alcohol - based hand sanitizer , and soap , as well as hand hygiene compliance rates .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	results :
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	during the study , the use of personal protective equipment during mers - cov compared with the period before mers - cov increased dramatically from 2,947.4 to 10,283.9 per 1,000 patient - days ( p < .0000001 ) for surgical masks and from 22 to 232 per 1,000 patient - days ( p < .0000001 ) for n95 masks .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	the use of alcohol - based hand sanitizer and soap showed a significant increase in utilized amount ( p < .0000001 ) .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	hand hygiene compliance rates increased from 73 % just before the occurrence of the first mers case to 88 % during mers cases ( p = .0001 ) .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	the monthly added cost was $ 16,400 for included infection control items .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	conclusions :
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	there was a significant increase in the utilization of surgical masks , respirators , soap and alcohol - based hand sanitizers .
b45169a9f726617e4906ab621fb6340281a79272	such an increase is a challenge and adds cost to the healthcare system .
f531a49b32cb686067326ca6810070fee527dfe2	we present an original approach to sound program extraction in a proof assistant , using syntax - driven automation to derive correct - by - construction imperative programs from nondeterministic functional source code .
f531a49b32cb686067326ca6810070fee527dfe2	our approach does not require committing to a single inflexible compilation strategy and instead makes it straightforward to create domain - specific code translators .
f531a49b32cb686067326ca6810070fee527dfe2	in addition to a small set of core definitions , our framework is a large , user - extensible collection of compilation rules each phrased to handle specific language constructs , code patterns , or data manipulations .
f531a49b32cb686067326ca6810070fee527dfe2	by mixing and matching these pieces of logic , users can easily tailor extraction to their own domains and programs , getting maximum performance and ensuring correctness of the resulting assembly code .
f531a49b32cb686067326ca6810070fee527dfe2	using this approach , we complete the first proof - generating pipeline that goes automatically from high - level specifications to assembly code .
f531a49b32cb686067326ca6810070fee527dfe2	in our main case study , the original specifications are phrased to resemble sql - style queries , while the final assembly code does manual memory management , calls out to foreign data structures and functions , and is suitable to deploy on resource - constrained platforms .
f531a49b32cb686067326ca6810070fee527dfe2	the pipeline runs entirely within the coq proof assistant , leading to final , linked assembly code with overall full - functional - correctness proofs in separation logic .
d25f6fb47dd5eff8eb0caa73c0d7422f547a6544	background : infectious diseases that can cause epidemics , such as covid-19 , sars - cov , and mers - cov , constitute a major social issue , with healthcare providers fearing secondary , tertiary , and even quaternary infections .

0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	according to previous deletion analyses , m self - assembly involves multiple m sequence regions .
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	to identify important m amino acid residues for vlp assembly , we coexpressed n with multiple m mutants containing substitution mutations at the amino - terminal ectodomain , carboxyl - terminal endodomain , or transmembrane segments .
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	our results indicate that a dileucine motif in the endodomain tail ( 218ll219 ) is required for efficient n packaging into vlps .
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	results from cross - linking vlp analyses suggest that the cysteine residues 63 , 85 and 158 are not in close proximity to the m dimer interface .
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	we noted a significant reduction in m secretion due to serine replacement for c158 , but not for c63 or c85 .
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	further analysis suggests that c158 is involved in m - n interaction .
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	in addition to mutations of the highly conserved 107-swwsfnpe-114 motif , substitutions at codons w19 , w57 , p58 , w91 , y94 or f95 all resulted in significantly reduced vlp yields , largely due to defective m secretion .
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	vlp production was not significantly affected by a tryptophan replacement of y94 or f95 or a phenylalanine replacement of w19 , w57 or w91 .
0ba1801a150e25b029cf3c2a38573435b21dea80	combined , these results indicate the involvement of specific m amino acids during sars - cov virus assembly , and suggest that aromatic residue retention at specific positions is critical for m function in terms of directing virus assembly .

bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	introduction :
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	in many centers , children with diabetic ketoacidosis ( dka ) receive care either in an endocrinology ward or a pediatric intensive care unit ( picu ) .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	we conducted a quality improvement ( qi ) initiative to reduce potentially avoidable picu admissions of children with dka without increasing endocrinology ward - to - picu transfers .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	methods :
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	a survey of providers demonstrated opportunities to increase awareness of institutional criteria for picu admissions of children with dka .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	we created an electronic health record ( ehr ) dot - phrase , prepopulated with these criteria , and placed a note in the ehr for all patients with dka as a reference for all providers .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	an ehr - based data report was created to monitor the disposition of dka patients and the use of the dot - phrase ( process measure ) .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	the primary outcome measure was the potentially avoidable picu admissions for patients with dka .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	endocrinology ward - to - picu transfers were tracked as a balancing measure to ensure safe disposition .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	results :
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	after the implementation of the dot - phrase , use was variable , but averaged 33.4 % over 1 year .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	the percentage of dka admissions classified as potentially avoidable picu stays decreased from 4.1 % to 0.5 % , with a concurrent decrease in the total percentage of picu admissions for dka from 19.1 % to 8.4 % .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	the percentage of endocrinology ward - to - picu transfers also declined from 0.8 % to 0 % .
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	conclusions :
bf9994929a199da5b05183e4db1114494e2061c2	a novel ehr - based intervention increasing awareness and documentation of established pediatric dka management guidelines can be used to safely reduce picu admissions for dka without increasing the rate of endocrinology ward - to - intensive care unit transfers .
61958bd2036c8effd5537fc441bc5ee25b582258	since the outbreak of covid-19 in december 2019 , it has spread rapidly and widely ,
d513f15e32bef1b241085c514a4aa41923e0475b	this article analyzes ways that logistical services add value to products over and above traditional utility tradeoffs as a result of a confluence of aesthetic , economic , and cultural facets that we identify as enchantment .
d513f15e32bef1b241085c514a4aa41923e0475b	we delve into how enchantment might be digitally articulated through mediated ( as opposed to brick and mortar ) consumption , paying attention to the cultural techniques and affordances of the platforms and spaces .
d513f15e32bef1b241085c514a4aa41923e0475b	through a series of case studies , we examine ways in which enchantment can occur in digitally mediated shopping environments .
d513f15e32bef1b241085c514a4aa41923e0475b	our case studies suggest that enchanted digital logistical channels extend the value - creating functions of traditional logistics by creating consumption circumstances that surprise and intrigue , that suggest perceived scarcity , and that use social media to approach consumers in multiple ways to procure enchantment .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	two notable features have been identified in the sars - cov-2 genome : ( 1 ) the receptor binding domain of sars - cov-2 ; ( 2 ) a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids ( prra ) at the s1 and s2 boundary .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	for the first feature , the similar rbd identified in sars - like virus from pangolin suggests the rbd in sars - cov-2 may already exist in animal
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	host(s ) before it transmitted into human .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	the left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at s1 / s2 boundary , which is uniquely identified in sars - cov-2 .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	in this study , we identified two variants from the first guangdong sars - cov-2 cell strain , with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site ( prrar ) and its flank sites .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	more extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of prrar could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	these data indicate ( 1 ) the deletion of qtqtn , at the flank of polybasic cleavage site , is likely benefit the sars - cov-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples ; ( 2 ) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585 - 23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	the mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes ( or reverse ) that led to such genomic changes in sars - cov-2 requires further work .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	nonetheless , this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution .
197486e60a3a258cd100603d9679c3238803fede	the deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development .

b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	currently , there is no specific vaccine or effective antiviral available .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	anti - chikv phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer ( cpmo ) was evaluated for its antiviral efficacy and cytotoxcity in human cells and neonate murine model .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	two cpmos were designed to block translation initiation of a highly conserved sequence in chikv non - structural and structural polyprotein , respectively .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	pre - treatment of hela cells with cpmo1 signficantly suppressed chikv titre , chikv e2 protein expression and prevented chikv - induced cpe .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	cpmo1 activity was also chikv - specific as shown by the lack of cross - reactivity against sinv or denv replication .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	when administered prophylactically in neonate mice , 15 μg / g cpmo1v conferred 100 % survival against chikv disease .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	in parallel , these mice demonstrated significant reduction in viremia and viral load in various tissues .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	immunohistological examination of skeletal muscles and liver of cpmo1vtreated mice also showed healthy tissue morphology , in contrast to evident manifestation of chikv pathogenesis in pbs - or scrambled scpmo1v - treated groups .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	taken together , our findings highlight for the first time that cpmo1v has strong protective effect against chikv infection .
b98f753cf246353e2ffff6822aeff4f2f3c5a7b5	this warrants future development of morpholino as an alternative antiviral agent to address chikv infection in clinical applications .

46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	due to the inconvenience and difficulty of preparing seds from some patients , producing seds from allogeneic blood donations is gaining popularity .
46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	a major safety concern associated with allogeneic blood is virus transmission .
46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	we therefore herein evaluated the possibility of applying a solvent / detergent ( s / d ) treatment to inactivate viruses and studied the impacts of such treatment of seds to resolve des in a rabbit model .

46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	the des condition was determined by measuring aqueous tear secretion ( schirmer 's test ) , corneal fluorescein staining , a corneal histologic examination , tunel stain apoptosis , and corneal inflammatory marker ( tumor necrosis factor - α , interleukin ( il)-1β , il-8 , and il-6 ) expressions .
46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	we first confirmed that seds and s / d - seds had similar protein profiles and transforming growth factor ( tgf)-β contents .
46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	animal experiments showed that tear secretion did not significantly differ between the sed and s
46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	/ d - sed groups but was significantly higher than in the pbs group .
46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	eye fluorescein staining revealed dramatic improvements in epithelial defects in groups treated with seds or s / d - seds , and hematoxylin/ eosin staining revealed microscopic epithelial layers similar to those of the untreated controls .
46ebfbb3db79bab7f78361721e37e8b35a34037e	inflammatory markers and tunel studies showed that healthy epithelium had been restored in groups treated with seds or s / d - seds .

905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	dengue and malaria are two common , mosquito - borne infections , which may lead to mortality if not managed properly .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	concurrent infections of dengue and malaria are rare due to the different habitats of its vectors and activities of different carrier mosquitoes .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	the first case reported was in 2005 .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	since then , several concurrent infections have been reported between the dengue virus ( denv ) and the malaria protozoans , plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium vivax .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	symptoms of each infection may be masked by a simultaneous second infection , resulting in late treatment and severe complications .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	plasmodium knowlesi is also a common cause of malaria in malaysia with one of the highest rates of mortality .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	this report is one of the earliest in literature of concomitant infection between denv and p. knowlesi in which a delay in diagnosis had placed a patient in a life - threatening situation .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	case presentation :
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	a 59-year old man staying near the belum - temengor rainforest at the malaysia - thailand border was admitted with fever for 6 days , with respiratory distress .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	his non - structural protein 1 antigen and anti - denv immunoglobulin m tests were positive .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	he was treated for severe dengue with compensated shock .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	treating the dengue had so distracted the clinicians that a blood film for the malaria
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	parasite was not done .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	despite aggressive supportive treatment in the intensive care unit ( icu ) , the patient had unresolved acidosis as well as multi - organ failure involving respiratory , renal , liver , and haematological systems .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	it was due to the presentation of shivering in the icu , that a blood film was done on the second day that revealed the presence of p. knowlesi with a parasite count of 520,000 / μl. the patient was subsequently treated with artesunate - doxycycline and made a good recovery after nine days in icu .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	this case contributes to the body of literature on co - infection between denv and p. knowlesi and highlights the clinical consequences , which can be severe .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	awareness should be raised among health - care workers on the possibility of dengue - malaria co - infection in this region .
905c04852d7c5ce80e4abbdd81e70b4bbd555a19	further research is required to determine the real incidence and risk of co - infection in order to improve the management of acute febrile illness .

ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	this chapter discusses pulmonary hypertension , which represents a final common pathway of pulmonary vascular disease .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	3 idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( i.e. , primary pulmonary hypertension ) serves as a model of vascular reconfiguration formerly designated as " plexogenic arteriopathy .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	,,4 the 2003 world health organization ( who ) classification of pulmonary hypertension , however , has shifted the primary emphasis from the plexiform lesion ( now considered a generic marker of severe pulmonary hypertension ) toward an integrated construct that incorporates clinical history , epidemiology , and morphology in the classification schema .

ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	other major categories of pulmonary hypertension , including thromboembolic , hypoxic , and pulmonary venous hypertension , are each considered in separate sections that focus on morphologic patterns of recognition and the important underlying conditions that contribute to each category .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	the broad and complex topic of pulmonary vasculitis is discussed in chapter 29 , which serves as a companion chapter to this chapter .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	it is , admittedly , artificial to segregate pulmonary vascular pathology in one or two isolated chapters since blood vessels are involved either primarily or secondarily across the vast spectrum of lung pathology .
ab5f5e0f4c94fcf175a5b9eb7bec0d266b620cfe	the reader is therefore liberally referred to other areas of the text where vascular pathology is considered in the context of parenchymal or airway diseases .

327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	background :
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	in response to the novel influenza a h1n1 outbreak in the ny city area , 6090 patient samples were submitted over a 5-week period for a total of 14,114 viral diagnostic tests , including rapid antigen , direct immunofluorescence ( dfa ) , viral culture and pcr .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	little was known about the performance of the assays for the detection of novel h1n1 in the background of seasonal h1n1 , h3n2 and other circulating respiratory viruses .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	in addition , subtyping influenza a became critical for the identification of high risk
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	and/or hospitalized patients with novel h1n1 infection and for monitoring the spread of the outbreak .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	study design
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	: this study analyzed the performances of the binaxnow influenza a&b test ( binaxnow ) , the 3 m rapid detection flu a + b test ( 3ma + b ) , direct immunofluorescence , r - mix culture and the luminex xtag respiratory virus panel ( rvp ) for the detection of seasonal influenza , novel h1n1 and other respiratory viruses .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	rvp was also evaluated for its ability to differentiate seasonal h1n1 , h3n2 and novel h1n1 .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	results :
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	the sensitivities , specificities , ppvs and npvs for the detection of novel h1n1 , determined by comparing all four - test methods , were : rapid antigen : 17.8 % , 93.6 % , 77.4 % , 47.9 % ; dfa : 46.7 % , 94.5 % , 91.3 % , 58.9 % ; r - mix culture : 88.9 % , 100 % , 100 % , 87.9 % ; rvp : 97.8 % , 100 % , 100 % , 97.3 % .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	the individual sensitivities of binaxnow and 3ma + b as compared to r - mix culture for the detection of novel h1n1 were 9.6 % and 40 % , respectively .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	all unsubtypeable influenza a specimens identified by rvp and tested with the cdc novel
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	h1n1 specific rt - pcr assay were confirmed to be novel h1n1 .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	conclusions :
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	rapid antigen tests , dfa , r - mix culture and the xtag rvp test all detected the novel h1n1 strain , but with highly varied sensitivity .
327d892db0c7f31f556ba94bf7872d342f43738c	the rvp test provided the best diagnostic option as rvp demonstrated superior sensitivity for the detection of all influenza strains , including the novel h1n1 , provided accurate influenza a subtyping and identified a significant number of additional respiratory pathogens .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	intranasally administered live - attenuated influenza virus ( laiv ) vaccines provide significant protection against heterologous influenza a virus ( iav ) challenge .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	however , laiv administration can modify the bacterial microbiota in the upper respiratory tract , including alterations in species that cause pneumonia .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	we sought to evaluate the effect of bordetella bronchiseptica colonization on laiv immunogenicity and efficacy in swine , and the impact of laiv and iav challenge on b. bronchiseptica colonization and disease .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	laiv immunogenicity was not significantly impacted by b. bronchiseptica colonization , but protective efficacy against heterologous iav challenge in the upper respiratory tract was impaired .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	titers of iav in the nose and trachea of pigs that received laiv were significantly reduced when compared to non - vaccinated , challenged controls , regardless of b. bronchiseptica infection .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	pneumonia scores were higher in pigs colonized with b. bronchiseptica and challenged with iav , but this was regardless of laiv vaccination status .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	while laiv vaccination provided significant protection against heterologous iav challenge , the protection was not sterilizing and iav replicated in the respiratory tract of all laiv vaccinated pig .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	the interaction between iav , b. bronchiseptica , and host led to development of acute - type b. bronchiseptica lesions in the lung .
9bcf1d2a543d586018a6b55fd349a8c8b6b614a9	thus , the data presented do not negate the efficacy of laiv vaccination , but instead indicate that controlling b. bronchiseptica colonization in swine could limit the negative interaction between iav and bordetella on swine health .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	feces from 142 animals were collected on 15 farms in the region of brittany , france .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	each sample was directly collected from the rectum of the animal and identified with the ear tag number .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	animals were sampled three times , at 5 , 15 and 22 weeks of age .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	after dna extraction from stool samples , nested pcr was performed to amplify partial 18s - rdna and 60 kda glycoprotein genes of cryptosporidium .

fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	one hundred out of 142 calves ( 70.4 % ) were found to be parasitized by cryptosporidium .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	amplified fragments were sequenced for cryptosporidium species identification and revealed the presence of c. parvum ( 43.8 % ) , c. ryanae ( 28.5 % ) , and c. bovis ( 27 % ) .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	one animal was infected with cryptosporidium ubiquitum .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	the prevalence of these species was related to the age of the animal .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	c. parvum caused 86.7 % of cryptosporidium infections in 5-week - old calves but only 1.7 % in 15-week - old animals .
fcf41a33dfcb8326a794806dc8bd7585c7e9e591	the analysis of the results showed that animals could be infected successively by c. parvum , c. ryanae , and c. bovis for the study period .

64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	ebola virus is a severe , frequently fatal illness , with a case fatality rate up to 90 % .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	the outbreak of the disease has been acknowledged by world health organization as public health emergency of international concern .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	the threat of ebola in west africa is still a major setback to the socioeconomic development .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	optimal control theory is applied to a system of ordinary differential equations which is modeling ebola infection through three different routes including contact between humans and a dead body .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	in an attempt to reduce infection in susceptible population , a preventive control is put in the form of education and campaign and two treatment controls are applied to infected and late - stage infected ( super ) human population .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	the pontryagins maximum principle is employed to characterize optimality control , which is then solved numerically .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	it is observed that time optimal control is existed in the model .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	the activation of each control showed a positive reduction of infection .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	the overall effect of activation of all the controls simultaneously reduced the effort required for the reduction of the infection quickly .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	the obtained results present a good framework for planning and designing cost - effective strategies for good interventions in dealing with ebola disease .
64872af73c55b4911ad9cf224868ac9db9519382	it is established that in order to reduce ebola threat all the three controls must be taken into consideration concurrently .
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	background
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and the subsequent emergence of the h5n1 virus have highlighted the threat of a global pandemic influenza outbreak .
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	planning effective public health control measures for such a case will be highly dependent on sound theory - based research on how people perceive the risks involved in such an event .
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	purpose
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	the present article aims to review theoretical models and concepts underlying current empirical research on pandemic influenza risk perception .
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	method a review was conducted based on 28 empirical studies from 30 articles which were published between 2003 and 2007 .
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	results concepts of risk perception mostly seemed more pragmatic than theory - based and were highly heterogeneous , for instance , in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components .
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	similarly , the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model - based .
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	conclusions
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	the current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights .
2dcd4ac570e72bcc2ab58b80764b158e0439cb10	unlike the reviewed studies , which were mostly launched as a rapid response to outbreak situations , future research will have to invest more strongly into theoretical work to provide sounder evidence .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	in today 's social network age , information flowing in networks does not derive solely from external sources ; people in the network also independently generate signals .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	these self - generated signals may not be deliberate lies , but they may not bear any relationship with the truth , either .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	following the philosopher harry g. frankfurt , we refer to such self - generated signals as bullshit .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	we present an information diffusion model that allows nodes which hold no value to spread information , capturing the diffusion of bullshit information .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	the presence of self - generated signals ( i.e. , bullshit ) increases the amount of information available for transmission in the network .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	however , participants in the spread process respond to the existence of such self - generated information by receiving data from internal sources with caution .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	these two contradictory forces - the increase in information transmission on the one hand , and in suspicion on the other - result in a two - sided effect of bullshit on the total spread time .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	we first take a numerical approach , simulating our model on watts - strogatz networks and building a decision tree to characterize the effects of bullshit given different network structures .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	we find that increasing the rate of self - generated information may have either a monotonic or non - monotonic effect on the rumor spread time , depending on the network structure and rate of non - self - generated internal communications .
25e863475aa0fb139abe053d8c4fd878260c57f0	then , taking an analytical approach , we analyze the spread behavior for cliques , and identify the conditions for monotonic behavior in a 2-clique network .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk for complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) infection .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	however , comprehensive data of sars - cov-2 infection in solid organ transplant ( sot ) recipients are still lacking .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	we performed a multicenter nationwide observational study within the swiss transplant cohort study ( stcs ) to describe the epidemiology , clinical presentation , treatment and outcomes of the first microbiologically documented sars - cov-2 infection among sot recipients .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	overall , 21 patients were included with a median age of 56 years ( 10 kidney , 5 liver , 1 pancreas , 1 lung , 1 heart and 3 combined transplantations ) .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	the most common presenting symptoms were fever ( 76 % ) , dry cough ( 57 % ) , nausea ( 33 % ) and diarrhea ( 33 % ) .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	ninety - five percent and 24 % of patients required hospital and icu admission , respectively , and 19 % were intubated .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	after a median of 33 days of follow - up , 16 patients were discharged , 3 were still hospitalized and 2 patients died .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	these data suggest that clinical manifestations of sars - cov-2 infection in middle - aged sot recipients appear to be similar to the general population without an apparent higher rate of complications .
27c415dafb8d919e0198c81ec6f2247e2b9dcbb8	these results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	purpose of review despite advances in diagnostic microbiology and sepsis management , community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	current recommendations regarding the use of beta - lactams in combination with macrolides published in clinical practice guidelines are variable and based on low - quality evidence that is frequently retrospective , observational , and heterogeneous in nature .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	while population - based studies have historically suggested improved clinical outcomes with the routine use of macrolide combination therapy in hospitalized patients with cap , emerging evidence from recent randomized controlled trials has challenged this practice .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	in this article , we discuss the historical rationale and current evidence for combination macrolide therapy in the management of cap .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	recent findings recent randomized controlled trials have assessed the non - inferiority of beta - lactam monotherapy compared to beta - lactam / macrolide combination therapy in adult patients hospitalized with cap .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	beta - lactam monotherapy was associated with equivalent clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate cap .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	patients with severe cap managed with beta - lactam monotherapy have demonstrated worse clinical outcomes when compared to patients treated with combination therapy .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	in addition , previous beta - lactam exposure prior to hospitalization has not been shown to negatively impact outcomes in patients managed with beta - lactam monotherapy in the hospital .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	summary current evidence supports the use of beta - lactam monotherapy in adult patients hospitalized with mild to moderate cap .
332d3e0cd20303c1d98e109645eaef4bfd97a8ee	while existing evidence supports the use of combination therapy in patients with severe pneumonia , further large - scale randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to clarify the role of combination therapy in this population .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	background :
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	in mid - june 2009 the state of victoria in australia appeared to have the highest notification rate of pandemic ( h1n1 ) 2009 influenza in the world .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	we hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	in contrast , this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of australia , including western australia ( wa ) .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	we used data from detailed case follow - up of patients with confirmed infection in victoria and wa to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two australian states on opposite sides of the continent .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	we modelled the pandemic in both states , using a susceptible - infected - removed model with bayesian inference accounting for imported cases .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	results :
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	epidemic transmission occurred earlier in victoria and later in wa .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	only 5 % of the first 100 victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	by contrast , 53 % of the first 102 cases in wa were associated with importation from victoria .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	using plausible model input data , estimation of the effective reproductive number for the victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data .
8126e29c1a00af5300f325021430faf4dfecbdc0	this was not required in modelling the epidemic in wa .

0953fa36903063f60627e07f7b4e07f0aec3c4d3	while covs are poor inducers of type i ifns in tissue culture , several studies have demonstrated the importance of the type i ifn response in controlling mhv infection in animals .
0953fa36903063f60627e07f7b4e07f0aec3c4d3	the protective effectors against mhv infection are , however , still unknown .
0953fa36903063f60627e07f7b4e07f0aec3c4d3	in order to get more insight into the antiviral gene expression induced in the brains of mhvinfected mice , we performed whole - genome expression profiling .

637081a7b01e7a1a30fe7427ab34ec407b3c2c72	it was shown previously that if we can find an l such that ( r , b , l ) forms a hadamard triple , then the associated fractal self - affine measure generated by ( r , b ) admits an exponential orthonormal basis of certain frequency set λ , and hence it is termed as a spectral measure .
637081a7b01e7a1a30fe7427ab34ec407b3c2c72	in this paper , we show that if # b < | det(r)| , not only it is spectral , we can also construct arbitrarily sparse spectrum λ in the sense that its beurling dimension is zero .

6264cb1fdbd7370e4b21e35a02bbb49d4d4c1ddd	the ich s6r1 and s8 guidelines define a general framework for the immunotoxicity evaluation of biotechnologyderived pharmaceuticals and human pharmaceuticals , respectively .
6264cb1fdbd7370e4b21e35a02bbb49d4d4c1ddd	as severe and unpredicted adverse events dramatically showed in the recent years that the immune system is a critical aspect of drug safety , this framework needs to be revisited to enhance the prediction of nonclinical immune safety evaluation .
6264cb1fdbd7370e4b21e35a02bbb49d4d4c1ddd	safety immunopharmacology is deemed to contribute to this awaited improvement by enabling early screening of the potential for drug candidates to induce unexpected immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects as well as nonimmune - mediated hypersensitivity reactions .
6264cb1fdbd7370e4b21e35a02bbb49d4d4c1ddd	dedicated safety immunopharmacology can also generate mechanistic data to determine which relevant additional immunotoxicity studies should be conducted .
6264cb1fdbd7370e4b21e35a02bbb49d4d4c1ddd	immunological assays and models that can be considered for use in the context of safety pharmacology studies are presented as well as perspectives for their timely development .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	the chinese government began implementing extensive public health measures aimed at confronting covid-19 during january 2020 .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	these measures included contact tracing , disease surveillance , and enforced social distancing , as well as close monitoring of those infected and extensive quarantine and isolation measures .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	authorities engaged in an unprecedented effort to cordon off wuhan , the epicenter of the outbreak .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	the measures adopted in china echoed and amplified approaches undertaken during recent outbreaks of sars ( 2003 ) and mers ( 2012 ) .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	although their intensity is unique , these measures are largely grounded in long - standing public health approaches to respiratory viruses .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	as covid-19 has spread to other parts of the globe , other nations have adopted social distancing , quarantine , and isolation strategies .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	here , we investigate how these measures have impacted covid-19 's time - varying reproduction number at the national level and globally .

d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	i − t j strategies ( or the lack thereof ) may influence the time distribution between primary and secondary infections , we estimate the weibull parameters jointly with the model instead of specifying the parameters using reported incubation times .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	the baseline rate captures the rate of exogenous μ ( imported ) infections in a given region .
d50f2b5d8b2b131052cbf54f8809697a2bfd69ca	the point process in equation ( 1 ) can be viewed as an approximation to the common sir model of infectious diseases during the initial phase of an epidemic when the total infections is small compared to the overall population size [ 3 ] .

7a9cb226022616147d04125c7f7fdf6223998964	using mostly theoretical models and traditional risk / uncertainty measures ( vix index , panic , precaution , scary bad news , etc . ) , the current literature tries to clarify the risk / uncertaintydeleveraging pattern .
7a9cb226022616147d04125c7f7fdf6223998964	the findings are not sufficient to explain the dynamic empirical relationship between modern risk / uncertainty indicators and leverage .
7a9cb226022616147d04125c7f7fdf6223998964	we fill this gap in the literature by using us quarterly data , from 1985:1 to 2018:4 , granger causality tests , and a structural vector autoregression model .
7a9cb226022616147d04125c7f7fdf6223998964	we find that commercial bank leverage rises when geopolitical risk and macroeconomic , policy , and equity uncertainty increase .
7a9cb226022616147d04125c7f7fdf6223998964	client - based business relationships of banks and high government borrowing from banks during crises periods are responsible for this relationship .
7a9cb226022616147d04125c7f7fdf6223998964	we find that the leverage of broker - dealers and shadow banks declines when chicago risk and macroeconomic , policy , financial , and equity uncertainty increase .
7a9cb226022616147d04125c7f7fdf6223998964	we argue that the vulnerability of broker - dealers and shadow banks to the risk / uncertainty of the entire market system is responsible for this relationship .

673fab4ff8140824a36b46c7094bc9562b670810	although technology - based learning ( tb - learning ) has been accepted as an efficient educational tool in the field of dentistry , evaluation of tb - learning in non - prepared situations such as pandemics has not been fully investigated .
673fab4ff8140824a36b46c7094bc9562b670810	this study aimed to evaluate different aspects of tb - learning among undergraduate dental students during the pandemic outbreak of covid-19 .
673fab4ff8140824a36b46c7094bc9562b670810	dental students in selected iraqi universities ( university of baghdad , university of sulaimani , and dijlah university college ) were invited to join the study .
673fab4ff8140824a36b46c7094bc9562b670810	a questionnaire was created using a google platform and answered by students .
673fab4ff8140824a36b46c7094bc9562b670810	satisfaction and attitude toward tb - learning plus total evaluation scores for lecturers were examined .
673fab4ff8140824a36b46c7094bc9562b670810	a total of 832 out of 1800 dental students participated in the study .

bb35acf637f45f1afca8b6df88ec85d6350a0008	the coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
bb35acf637f45f1afca8b6df88ec85d6350a0008	( sars - cov-2 ) , has spread rapidly worldwide , seriously endangering human health .
bb35acf637f45f1afca8b6df88ec85d6350a0008	in addition to the typical symptoms of pulmonary infection , patients with covid-19 have been reported to have gastrointestinal symptoms and/or intestinal flora dysbiosis .
bb35acf637f45f1afca8b6df88ec85d6350a0008	it is known that a healthy intestinal flora is closely related to the maintenance of pulmonary and systemic health by regulating the host immune homeostasis .
bb35acf637f45f1afca8b6df88ec85d6350a0008	role of the " gut - lung axis " has also been well - articulated .
bb35acf637f45f1afca8b6df88ec85d6350a0008	this review provides a novel suggestion that intestinal flora may be one of the mediators of the gastrointestinal responses and abnormal immune responses in hosts caused by sars - cov-2 ; improving the composition of intestinal flora and the proportion of its metabolites through probiotics , and personalized diet could be a potential strategy to prevent and treat covid-19 .
bb35acf637f45f1afca8b6df88ec85d6350a0008	more clinical and evidence - based medical trials may be initiated to determine the strategy .
8a84c8827f0a55d3a8b8efd1d3439de1738ddd6a	the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) from the hubei province in china in late 2019 demonstrates the epidemic potential of coronaviruses .
8a84c8827f0a55d3a8b8efd1d3439de1738ddd6a	the rapid spread of this virus across the world in only 2 months highlights the transmissibility of this family of viruses and the significant morbidity and mortality that they can cause .
8a84c8827f0a55d3a8b8efd1d3439de1738ddd6a	we highlight the current state of knowledge of coronavirus biology while answering questions concerning the current outbreak of sars - cov-2 .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	around 60 % of pheasants released for shooting in the uk , an estimated 21 million birds , do not end up at their intended fate : being shot .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	this constitutes wastage , raising economic , environmental and ethical questions .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	we review what is known of the fates of released pheasants and consider why they do not directly contribute to the numbers harvested .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	we focus on four main explanations : predation , disease , starvation and dispersal , and highlight other important causes of mortality .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	for each explanation , we attempt to attribute levels of loss and identify timings or conditions when such losses may be heaviest .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	we review factors that exacerbate losses and methods available to mitigate them .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	opportunities for amelioration may arise at all stages of the rearing and release of pheasants and involve changes to the conditions under which eggs are produced , the way young pheasants are reared or the management of the environment into which they are released .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	we found few studies investigating impacts of post - release management techniques on pheasant survival outside of the breeding season within a uk context .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	we found that a number of less commonly deployed practices focusing on early - life , pre - release management may improve survival .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	given the scale of pheasant releasing in the uk , even improvements in survival of 1 % would mean that~350,000 fewer birds die of natural causes .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	complementing current post - release management with proven novel pre - release management interventions could reduce the number of pheasants required for release , whilst maintaining current shooting levels .
95d66d6410fa33513c7d7551287453674398f05b	lowering release numbers would lower financial costs , benefit the environment and reduce some ethical concerns over the release and shooting of reared pheasants .
10e69f91c727119b63a5c85795d7cde7a315e53f	despite fluctuations for economic or political reasons , the number of passengers and volume of cargo carried by air is growing quickly , leading to a shortage of airport capacity in some european regions with few slots available at some hubs .
10e69f91c727119b63a5c85795d7cde7a315e53f	this problem has accelerated the trend towards an increase in airport capacity for larger aircraft everywhere , a process which started in the uk and is now continuing throughout europe , especially in germany .
10e69f91c727119b63a5c85795d7cde7a315e53f	apart from development at the hubs , however , many small airports have also been enlarged , former military airbases have been converted to civilian use , and new runways are to be built in areas away from centres of population .
10e69f91c727119b63a5c85795d7cde7a315e53f	these changes have occurred within a short period of time .
10e69f91c727119b63a5c85795d7cde7a315e53f	in germany , the number of available airports with runways over 1800 m will have doubled in a period of 10 - 15 years .

ca70e687fe7d0471c95bc8e75b588860343fb0c6	participants included 660 college students who consented to complete a questionnaire .
ca70e687fe7d0471c95bc8e75b588860343fb0c6	the results showed significant differences between students who perceived that they were at risk for type 2 diabetes onset and those who thought their peers were the ones at risk .
ca70e687fe7d0471c95bc8e75b588860343fb0c6	a higher prevalence of participants thought their peers were the ones at risk for type 2 diabetes .

3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393	the filoviruses ebolavirus and marburgvirus are among the deadliest viral pathogens known to infect humans , causing emerging diseases with fatality rates of up to 90 % during some outbreaks .
3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393	the replication cycles of these viruses are comprised of numerous complex molecular processes and interactions with their human host , with one key feature being the means by which nascent virions exit host cells to spread to new cells and ultimately to a new host .
3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393	this review focuses on our current knowledge of filovirus egress and the viral and host factors and processes that are involved .
3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393	within the virus , these factors consist of the major matrix protein , viral protein 40
3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393	( vp40 ) , which is necessary and sufficient for viral particle release , and nucleocapsid and glycoprotein that interact with vp40 to promote egress .
3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393	in the host cell , some proteins are hijacked by filoviruses in order to enhance virion budding capacity that include members of the family of e3 ubiquitin ligase and the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( escrt ) pathway , while others such as tetherin inhibit viral egress .
3d4b0d8d4ac0c8419efb82278b823952e94d1393	an understanding of these molecular interactions that modulate viral particle egress provides an important opportunity to identify new targets for the development of antivirals to prevent and treat filovirus infections .

d4953e2a564f68bc7eccd8d1af12da3c2c5bbf7c	we also include a stream - wise attention gating that prioritizes between the two streams and a frame - wise attention module that prioritizes the video frames that contain relevant features .
d4953e2a564f68bc7eccd8d1af12da3c2c5bbf7c	experiments are conducted on an fpv dataset containing 18 activity classes in office environments .
d4953e2a564f68bc7eccd8d1af12da3c2c5bbf7c	in comparison to a single - stream network , the proposed twostream method achieves an absolute improvement of 14.366 % and 10.324 % for averaged f1 score and accuracy , respectively , when average results are compared for three different frame sizes 224×224 , 112×112 , and 64×64 .
d4953e2a564f68bc7eccd8d1af12da3c2c5bbf7c	the proposed method provides significant performance gains for lower - resolution images with absolute improvements of 17 % and 26 % in f1 score for input dimensions of 112 × 112 and 64 × 64 , respectively .
d4953e2a564f68bc7eccd8d1af12da3c2c5bbf7c	the best performance is achieved for a frame size of 224 × 224 yielding an f1 score and accuracy of 90.176 % and 90.799 % which outperforms the state - of - the - art inflated 3d convnet ( i3d ) [ 1 ] method by an absolute margin of 4.529 % and 2.419 % , respectively .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	tomographic imaging has benefited from advances in x - ray sources , detectors and optics to enable novel observations in science , engineering and medicine .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	these advances have come with a dramatic increase of input data in the form of faster frame rates , larger fields of view or higher resolution , so high performance solutions are currently widely used for analysis .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	tomographic instruments can vary significantly from one to another , including the hardware employed for reconstruction : from single cpu workstations to large scale hybrid cpu / gpu supercomputers .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	flexibility on the software interfaces and reconstruction engines are also highly valued to allow for easy development and prototyping .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	this paper presents a novel software framework for tomographic analysis that tackles all aforementioned requirements .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	the proposed solution capitalizes on the increased performance of sparse matrixvector multiplication and exploits multi - cpu and gpu reconstruction over mpi .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	the solution is implemented in python and relies on cupy for fast gpu operators and cuda kernel integration , and on scipy for cpu sparse matrix computation .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	as opposed to previous tomography solutions that are tailor - made for specific use cases or hardware , the proposed software is designed to provide flexible , portable and highperformance operators that can be used for continuous integration at different production environments , but also for prototyping new experimental settings or for algorithmic development .
ce666fb2eb59f4bf52de669ae2ff84f519fa09a0	the experimental results demonstrate how our implementation can even outperform state - of - theart software packages used at advanced x - ray sources worldwide .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	very often , university students deliberately form self - organized study groups , e.g. to study collaboratively for an upcoming exam .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	yet , very little is known about what regulation problems such self - organized study groups encounter during their learning process and how they try to cope with these problems .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	therefore , this study investigates how completely self - organized groups ( i.e. , non - guided groups outside the classroom that form without external impulse ) regulate their collaborative learning process when faced with different kinds of regulation problems .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	more specifically , we tested the hypotheses that members of self - organized study groups are more satisfied with their group learning experience ( a )
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	the more homogeneous their problem perceptions are within their group ,
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	( b ) the more they apply immediate ( rather than non - immediate ) strategies to remedy their regulation problems , and ( c )
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	the more frequently they apply regulation strategies .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	in a longitudinal study , n = 122 students , voluntarily studying for their exams in n = 52 groups , were asked to indicate the types of problems they experienced , the types of strategies they used to tackle those problems , and their satisfaction with their group learning experience after each of their self - organized study meetings .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	hierarchical linear modeling confirmed all hypotheses .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	qualitative analysis of two selected groups ' selfreported situational data provided additional insights about the mechanisms that may have contributed to the results .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	our study provides important directions for future research , including the recommendation to identify the processes by which groups ( a ) can reach homogeneity of problem perceptions and
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	( b ) coordinate the choice of appropriate strategies within the group .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	an enduring theme of cscl research has been the question of how computer - supported collaborative learning can be structured so
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	that learning outcomes at the individual level ( such as knowledge acquisition ; e.g. , haake and pfister 2010 ) or at the group level ( such as quality of a group product ; e.g. , popov et al . 2017 ) can be improved when compared to unstructured cscl .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	much of this research has been centered on the concept of collaboration scripts ( e.g. , fischer et al . 2013 ; rummel et al . 2009 ) .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	collaboration scripts scaffold the collaboration process within groups by specifying , sequencing and distributing activities and roles among the learners of a group ( kollar et al . 2006 ) .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	even though such scripts generally have been shown to be effective ( vogel et al . 2017 ) , their application " in the wild " , i.e. , in informal , selfguided learning contexts , is not unproblematic , as scholars have criticized collaboration scripts for possibly over - structuring the learning process so that collaboration might become a highly coercive experience ( " over - scripting " ; dillenbourg 2002 ) , though recent work challenges this concern ( radkowitsch et al . 2020 ) .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	especially self - organized groups , i.e. , groups that students form completely voluntarily based on their own initiative outside regular classroom contexts ( e.g. , to jointly study for an upcoming exam ) , might find discomfort in following such finegrained externally imposed instructions .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	it is believed that this , in turn might even result in hampering effective learning ( raes et al . 2016 ; vauras et al . 2003 ) .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	although it is a very common form of collaborative learning , cscl research has not extensively addressed self - organized collaborative learning thus far .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	exceptions are studies by hadwin et al .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	( 2018 ) and volet et al .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	( 2009 ) , who suggested that groups need help in joint planning
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	( e.g. , to help learners share their understanding of the given tasks ) or in the selection of effective strategies
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	( e.g. , to help them ask effective questions ) .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	nevertheless , collaboration in such studies was still structured at least in the sense that students were obliged to work at the university , to collaborate mainly using a computer , and to work uniformly on predetermined tasks for a predetermined number of study meetings .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	thus , evidence on how completely selforganized groups regulate their learning in authentic contexts is still very scarce .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	this is regrettable , especially in the light of the current covid-19 crisis , during which self - organized , technology - enhanced collaboration might have tremendous potential to enhance learning .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	therefore , this study tries to uncover what differentiates successful from less successful selforganized collaborative learning , in an attempt to derive implications for further research on how to design instructional support for this kind of ( computer - supported ) collaborative learning .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	in the present article , we conceptualize collaboration in self - organized study groups as an instance of ( socially ) self - regulated learning ( järvelä and hadwin 2013 ) that requires groups to make decisions on their own learning process ( e.g. , concerning questions such as when and how long to meet , how to approach comprehension problems , or what technology to use during collaboration )
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	( zimmerman and moylan 2009 ) .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	then , we describe typical problems during self - organized collaborative learning , thereby differentiating between coordinationrelated problems , motivational problems , and comprehension - related problems ( järvelä and järvenoja 2011 ; kirschner et al . 2008 ) .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	based on this , we develop a theoretical model that systematically embeds three precursors of students ' satisfaction with their group learning experience into the regulatory process .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	we assume that groups should be more satisfied with their group learning experience the more
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	they ( a ) have a homogeneous problem perception and
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	( b ) use strategies that are immediate with respect to resolving the given regulation problem , and the more intensively they ( c ) apply regulation strategies .
5364454e3ab447c9a34e2aedb3bbc4880d05cc09	we tested these assumptions in an n. melzner et al .

00aa9cbf61505e3fa77ef009eafe04300a5c39b2	the disease is established on all continents apart from antarctica ; most cases are reported in africa and asia , with thousands of deaths recorded annually .
00aa9cbf61505e3fa77ef009eafe04300a5c39b2	however , the estimated annual fi gure of almost 60 000 human rabies fatalities is probably an underestimate .
00aa9cbf61505e3fa77ef009eafe04300a5c39b2	almost all cases of human rabies result from bites from infected dogs .
00aa9cbf61505e3fa77ef009eafe04300a5c39b2	therefore , the most cost - eff ective approach to elimination of the global burden of human rabies is to control canine rabies rather than expansion of the availability of human prophylaxis .
00aa9cbf61505e3fa77ef009eafe04300a5c39b2	mass vaccination campaigns with parenteral vaccines , and advances in oral vaccines for wildlife , have allowed the elimination of rabies in terrestrial carnivores in several countries worldwide .
00aa9cbf61505e3fa77ef009eafe04300a5c39b2	the subsequent reduction in cases of human rabies in such regions advocates the multidisciplinary one health approach to rabies control through the mass vaccination of dogs and control of canine populations .

5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	the royal college of physicians published the pharmacopoeia londinensis , " the first standard list of medicines and their ingredients in england " , in 1618 .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	it had been more than 30 years in the making .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	catalogues of available medicines and their composition have gradually evolved .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	the british national war formulary , a " selection of medicaments sufficient in range to meet ordinary requirements of therapeutics " was in this mould , but the new - style british national formulary ( bnf ) , first published in 1981 , contains in addition essential information on the indications , contraindications , cautions , dosage , and drug interactions of almost all licensed medicines used in general practice , and most drugs used in hospitals .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	the medicines act 1968 and its european successors demand that marketing authorizations ( " licences " ) are only issued if medicines fulfil three criteria - quality of manufacture , efficacy in the licensed indication , and reasonable safety .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	these are not , however , sufficient to ensure safe , rational , and cost - effective therapeutic choices .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	there are several reasons for this .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	2

5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	| multiplicity of medicines
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	there is a multiplicity of agents with similar or identical therapeutic properties .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	the current bnf lists 14 beta - blockers licensed for treatment of arterial hypertension : 10 angiotensin - converting - enzyme inhibitors ; eight angiotensin-2 antagonists , eight calcium antagonists , and five diuretics ; and at least 25 preparations combining two or more anti - hypertensives .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	the mere existence of so many alternatives means that patient safety is compromised by the potential for confusion among and between drugs of the same class but with different properties or dosage .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	there are also financial consequences , because some drugs may be more costly than others and because the need to keep several very similar drugs in stock carries costs both in acquisition ( and wastage ) and in space for storage .
5a34bd8d2b843fa9a95f275b5892e1fb76ef75d3	thus , choosing to limit the local availability of drugs with similar actions should make patients safer and should reduce costs .

06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	introduction : infectious acute respiratory disease ( ard ) is a significant cause of worldwide morbidity , disproportionately affecting individuals living in crowded conditions , such as found at military training centers , school dormitories , and correctional facilities .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	vaccines have been used to protect against ard ; however , these are not always available or effective .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	the medical literature on preventive nonvaccine ard interventions ( novardis ) for infectious diseases , which addressed personal measures , administrative controls , and engineering controls , was studied during 2000 to 2004 .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	population - based studies in community settings ( non - health care ) were reviewed in detail to evaluate the effectiveness of novardis .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	budgetary and logistic factors as well as acceptance were considered in formulating recommendations for implementation of novardis in military training centers .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	thirty - eight population - based studies contained in 35 publications were examined .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	three studies contained information on multiple novardis .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	nine studies supported the use of personal measures relating to hand hygiene .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	ten studies supported administrative controls such as cohorting military training units to reduce contact between units ( 4 studies ) , providing adequate personal space to reduce crowding ( 5 ) , and cloth barriers between beds ( 1 ) ; and 14 studies supported the use of engineering controls such as increased indoor air dilution and ventilation ( 2 ) , dust suppression ( 4 ) , and air sterilization ( 8) .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	conclusions :
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	promoting hand hygiene and reducing crowding through the provision of adequate living space and cohorting of training units may offer benefits in respiratory disease control .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	these interventions , along with uv lights and air dilution / ventilation , deserve further evaluation in controlled studies to assess their efficacy .
06e9041ff3cb1db28a5df4c73ae0942e1ee42b1f	novardis could benefit military and other populations living in close contact .

947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	periodontal diseases are initiated by bacterial species living in polymicrobial biofilms at or below the gingival margin and progress largely as a result of the inflammation initiated by specific subgingival species .
947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	in the past few decades , efforts to understand the microbiota of periodontal diseases have led to an exponential increase in information about biofilms associated with periodontal health and disease .
947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	in fact , the oral microbiota is one of the best characterized microbiomes that colonize the human body .
947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	despite this increased knowledge , one has to ask if our fundamental concepts of the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontal diseases have really changed .
947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	in this chapter we will review how our comprehension of the structure and function of the subgingival microbiota evolved over the years in search of lessons learned and unlearned in periodontal microbiology .
947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	more specifically , this review focuses on : 1 ) how the data obtained through molecular techniques has impacted our knowledge of the etiology of periodontal infections ; 2 ) the potential role of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of periodontal diseases ; 3 ) how concepts of microbial ecology have expanded our understanding of host microbial interactions that might lead to periodontal diseases ; 4 ) the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases ; and 5 )
947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	the impact of these evolving concepts on treatment and preventive approaches to periodontal infections .
947f8dd8bdf394efb2f27d252a1eadd66472232d	we will conclude by reviewing how novel systems biology approaches promise to unravel new details of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases and , hopefully , lead to a better understanding of periodontal disease mechanisms .

9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	objective influenza virus infections cause a high disease and economic burden during seasonal epidemics .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	however , there is still a need for reliable disease burden estimates to provide a more detailed picture of the impact of influenza .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	therefore , the objectives of this study is to estimate the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza virus infection and associated hospitalisation costs in adult patients in the netherlands during two consecutive influenza seasons .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	methods we conducted a retrospective study in adult patients with a laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection in three dutch hospitals during respiratory seasons 2014 - 2015 and 2015 - 2016 .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	incidence was calculated as the weekly number of hospitalised influenza patients divided by the total population in the catchment populations of the three hospitals .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were estimated and included costs for emergency department consultation , diagnostics , general ward and/or intensive care unit admission , isolation , antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	these hospitalisation costs were extrapolated to national level and expressed in 2017 euros .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	the study population consisted of 380 hospitalised adult influenza patients .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	the seasonal cumulative incidence was 3.5 cases per 10,000 persons in respiratory season 2014 - 2015 , compared to 1.8 cases per 10,000 persons in 2015 - 2016 .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	the arithmetic mean hospitalisation cost per influenza patient was € 6128 ( 95 % ci € 4934-€7737 ) per patient in 2014 - 2015 and € 8280 ( 95 % ci € 6254-€10,665 )
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	in 2015 - 2016 , potentially reaching total hospitalisation costs of € 28 million in 2014 - 2015 and € 20 million in 2015 - 2016 .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	conclusions influenza virus infections lead to 1.8 - 3.5 hospitalised patients per 10,000 persons , with mean hospitalisation costs of € 6100-€8300 per adult patient , resulting in 20 - 28 million euros annually in the netherlands .
9b4188047edce37d14ba607fab06cdadf5de41e1	the highest arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were found in the 45 - 64 year age group .

90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	recently , influenza virus - like rna genomes were detected in fruit bats ( sturnira lilium and artibeus planirostris ) in central and south america 5,6 .
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	since the amino acid sequences of their ha and na are distinct from those of all previously known iav subtypes , these bat - derived influenza viruses ( bativs ) were provisionally designated h17n10 and h18n11 .
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	however , previous studies have reported that h17 ha does not bind to sialic acids linked to galactose in sugar chains 7 , which are known as canonical receptors of iavs , and that n10 na lacks neuraminidase activity 8 which is also a common property of all known influenza viruses .
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	thus , bativ glycoproteins have also been called ha - like ( hl ) and na - like ( nl ) ( i.e. , hl17nl10 and hl18nl11 ) 9 .
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	however , information on the biological properties of these bativs is limited since infectious virus particles have never been isolated from infected animals .
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	bats belonging to the order chiroptera , which is known as the second largest order of mammalians , are distributed into more than 1,000 species globally 10 .
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	it has been shown that bats play crucial roles as natural reservoirs of some zoonotic pathogens such as marburg virus , hendra virus , nipah virus , lyssa virus , sars , and mers coronaviruses 11 - 14 .
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	thus , it is important to investigate the ecology of bat - derived pathogens and to clarify their potential risks as zoonotic pathogens .
90b43fc0b556b97bcc6ccc57f87f4e2811e0d4ed	our previous study revealed that vesicular stomatitis viruses ( vsvs ) pseudotyped with bativ glycoproteins efficiently infected cultured cells derived from particular bat species ( e.g. , miniopterus fuliginosus )

1b4d2b000ee885e242aa3b237597158d17889125	the experimental results indicated that the differentiated cells or tissues had higher or highest pc2 activity .
1b4d2b000ee885e242aa3b237597158d17889125	in the comparative experiments , more pc2 protein expression in the mature tissues and more cpe and prepronpy protein expression in the tumor cells or tumor tissue were observed , but no expression of prepronpy protein was observed in the mature tissues .
1b4d2b000ee885e242aa3b237597158d17889125	compared with ns20y or rgc-5 undifferentiated cells , its differentiated cells showed less propc2 , more procpe and more prepronpy protein expressions .
1b4d2b000ee885e242aa3b237597158d17889125	the results demonstrated that the mature tissues showed stronger pc2 / cpe - mediated pro - protein processing ability than the tumor cells or tissue .
1b4d2b000ee885e242aa3b237597158d17889125	the results also showed that the artificial differentiation of rgc-5 or ns20y cells was different from maturation of its corresponding normal tissue .
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	introduction :
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	since december 29 , 2019 a pandemic of new novel coronavirus - infected pneumonia named covid-19 has started from wuhan ( china ) has led to 254 996 confirmed cases until midday march 20 , 2020 .
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	sporadic cases have been imported worldwide , in algeria , the first case reported on february 25 , 2020 was imported from italy , and then the epidemic has spread to other parts of the country very quickly with 90 confirmed cases until march 19 , 2020 .
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	it is crucial to estimate the cases number growth in the early stages of the outbreak , to this end , we have implemented the alg - covid-19 model which allows to predict the incidence and the reproduction number r0 in the coming months in order to help decision makers .
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	the alg - covis-19 model initial equation ( 1 ) estimates the incidence ( cases number ) at ( t ) prediction time using two parameters : the reproduction number ( r0 ) and the serial interval

b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	: we found r0=2.56
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	( 95 % ci 2.16 - 2.98 ) based on actual incidence at the first 23 days , using the serial interval si= 4,4 and the prediction time t=23 .
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	the herd immunity hi estimated is hi=61 % .
b9fee2e7a978f00cedbd3fe81e75b23fdb2b6f2c	also , the covid-19 incidence predicted with the alg - covid-19 model fits closely the actual incidence during the first 23 days of the epidemic in algeria ( fig .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	background :
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	a major outbreak of human enterovirus 71-associated hand , foot and mouth disease in sarawak in 1997 marked the beginning of a series of outbreaks in the asia pacific region .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	some of these outbreaks had unusually high numbers of fatalities and this generated much fear and anxiety in the region .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	we established a sentinel surveillance programme for hand , foot and mouth disease in sarawak , malaysia , in march 1998 , and the observations of the first 7 years are described here .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	virus isolation , serotyping and genotyping were performed on throat , rectal , vesicle and other swabs .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	: during this period sarawak had two outbreaks of human enterovirus 71 , in 2000 and 2003 .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	the predominant strains circulating in the outbreaks of 1997 , 2000 and 2003 were all from genogroup b , but the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically distinct from each other .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	human enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every three years and coxsackievirus a16 co - circulated with human enterovirus 71 .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	although vesicles were most likely to yield an isolate , this sample was not generally available from most cases and obtaining throat swabs was thus found to be the most efficient way to obtain virological information .
6bbbd25c11b320bdd509a9c76417ed4045349708	knowledge of the epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 transmission will allow public health personnel to predict when outbreaks might occur and to plan interventions in an effective manner in order to reduce the burden of disease .
8878430aac1b32809652a81f70671e236a9fc5bc	the speed and scale of the global covid-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented pressures on health services worldwide , requiring new methods of service delivery during the health crisis .
8878430aac1b32809652a81f70671e236a9fc5bc	in the setting of severe resource constraint and high risk of infection to patients and clinicians , there is an urgent need to identify consensus statements on head and neck surgical oncology practice .
8878430aac1b32809652a81f70671e236a9fc5bc	we completed a modified delphi consensus process of three rounds with 40 international experts in head and neck cancer surgical , radiation , and medical oncology , representing 35 international professional societies and national clinical trial groups .
8878430aac1b32809652a81f70671e236a9fc5bc	endorsed by 39 societies and professional bodies , these consensus practice recommendations aim to decrease inconsistency of practice , reduce uncertainty in care , and provide reassurance for clinicians worldwide for head and neck surgical oncology in the context of the covid-19 pandemic and in the setting of acute severe resource constraint and high risk of infection to patients and staff .
90bf3caf925c494853bd4cd4e86153dd523c7d31	the world is currently witnessing a dramatic disruption of everyday life owing to the rapid progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pandemic .
90bf3caf925c494853bd4cd4e86153dd523c7d31	as the pandemic evolves , there is an urgent need to better understand its epidemiology , characterize its potential impact , and identify mitigatory strategies to avert pandemic - related mortality .
90bf3caf925c494853bd4cd4e86153dd523c7d31	there is a need for a tool or algorithm to evaluate the extent to which public health policy and/or economic preparedness measures are effectively averting covid-19 related mortality .
90bf3caf925c494853bd4cd4e86153dd523c7d31	we present a simple and yet practical epidemiological tool , the pandemic efficiency index ( pei ) , that can be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from covid-19 infection .
90bf3caf925c494853bd4cd4e86153dd523c7d31	using the pei and current covid-19-related mortality , we determined that so far germany demonstrates the highest pei ( 5.1 ) among countries with more than 5,000 recorded cases of the infection , indicating high quality measures instituted by the country to avert death during the pandemic .
90bf3caf925c494853bd4cd4e86153dd523c7d31	italy and france currently have the lowest covid-19-related peis .
90bf3caf925c494853bd4cd4e86153dd523c7d31	epidemics and pandemics come and go , but local , national , and global abilities to determine the efficiency of their efforts in averting deaths is critical .

b9a8782661a61d1562b8d6a2098fd35c76b35349	we previously hypothesized that hiv-1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response .
b9a8782661a61d1562b8d6a2098fd35c76b35349	to further explore our hypothesis , we used the 454 sequence analysis of a large naïve library of human igm antibodies which had been used for selecting antibodies against sars cov receptor - binding domain ( rbd ) , and soluble g proteins ( sg ) of henipaviruses .
b9a8782661a61d1562b8d6a2098fd35c76b35349	we found that the human igm repertoires from the 454 sequencing have diverse germline usages , recombination patterns , junction diversity , and a lower extent of somatic mutation .
b9a8782661a61d1562b8d6a2098fd35c76b35349	in this study , we identified antibody maturation intermediates that are related to bnabs against the hiv-1 and other viruses as observed in normal individuals , and compared their genetic diversity and somatic mutation level along with available structural and functional data .
b9a8782661a61d1562b8d6a2098fd35c76b35349	further computational analysis will provide framework for understanding the underlying genetic and molecular determinants related to maturation pathways of antiviral bnabs that could be useful for applying novel approaches to the design of effective vaccine immunogens and antibody - based therapeutics .

3af4b6bdf86ac98834c2099c89b7020e68398594	introduces vulnerabilities absent in other programs .
3af4b6bdf86ac98834c2099c89b7020e68398594	furthermore , it is very difficult , if not impossible , to patch a smart contract after it has been deployed .
3af4b6bdf86ac98834c2099c89b7020e68398594	therefore , smart contracts must be formally verified before they are deployed on the blockchain to avoid attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities .
3af4b6bdf86ac98834c2099c89b7020e68398594	there is a recent surge of interest in analyzing and verifying smart contracts .
3af4b6bdf86ac98834c2099c89b7020e68398594	while most of the existing works either focus on evm bytecode or translate solidity contracts into programs in intermediate languages for analysis and verification , we believe that a direct executable formal semantics of the high - level programming language of smart contracts is necessary to guarantee the validity of the verification .
3af4b6bdf86ac98834c2099c89b7020e68398594	in this work , we propose a generalized formal semantic framework based on a general semantic model of smart contracts .
3af4b6bdf86ac98834c2099c89b7020e68398594	furthermore , this framework can directly handle smart contracts written in different high - level programming languages through semantic extensions and facilitates the formal verification of security properties with the generated semantics .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	we uncover and highlight the importance of social distancing duration and intensity in lowering hospitalization demand - to - supply during the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) epidemic in the usa .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	we have developed an epidemic progression model involving the susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered dynamics , the age - stratified disease transmissibility , and the possible large - scale undocumented ( i.e. , asymptomatic and/or untested ) transmission of covid-19 taking place in the usa .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	our analysis utilizes covid-19 observational data in the usa between march 19 and 28 , corresponding to the early stage of the epidemic when the impacts of social distancing on disease progression were yet to manifest .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	calibrating our model using epidemiological data from this time period enabled us to unbiasedly address the question " how long and with what intensity does the usa need to implement social distancing intervention during the covid-19 pandemic ? "
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	for a short ( i.e. , up to two weeks ) duration , we find a near - linear decrease in hospital beds demand with increasing intensity ( ϕ ) of social distancing .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	for a duration longer than two weeks , our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing , characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	long - term implementation of strict social distancing with ϕ > 50 % could lead to the emergence of a second wave of infections due to a large residual susceptible population which highlights the need for contact tracing and isolation before re - opening of the economy .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	finally , we investigate the scenario of intermittent social distancing and find an optimal social - to - no - distancing duration ratio of 5:1 corresponding to a sustainable reduction in medical demands .

5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	here , we address these concerns by investigating the dynamics of three social distancing strategies - indefinite , finite - duration , and intermittent - on age - stratified us population and benchmark its effectiveness in reducing the burden on hospital beds .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	we find that a wholesale , indefinite social distancing could balance the demand - to - supply ratios of hospital beds at epidemic peaks provided a 70 % reduction in the time - of - exposure of the population within all age groups is achieved .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	we find that finite - duration social distancing manifests itself into two distinct regimes .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	for social distancing lasting less than two weeks , a higher reduction in the time - of - exposure of the population results in less hospitalizations .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	for social distancing lasting longer than two weeks , ∼50 % reduction in the time - of - exposure of the population yields the largest reduction in hospitalizations .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	greater than this threshold reduction intensity , our analysis shows a large buildup of susceptible individuals , who remain prone to the infection at the end of the social distancing period .
5b27968100362a99a517a347413793376a60d04f	overall , we emphasize the exponentially diminishing medical cost benefits of finite - duration social distancing - a phenomenon characterized by a linear decrease in medical demand achieved against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration .

eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	in january 2020 , a covid-19 outbreak was detected in sichuan province of china .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	the aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of the performed interventions .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	we analyzed patient records for all laboratory - confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of january 21 to march 16 , 2020 .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	to estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers , we used a bayesian framework .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	in addition , we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	the outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases , lasted less than two months , and no further local transmission was detected after february 27 .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	the median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	severity of symptoms increased with age .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	we estimated r 0 at 2.4 ( 95 % ci : 1.6 - 3.7 ) .
eb81e7da582d4d34afed35d18651986c2b827089	the epidemic was self - sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by sichuan authorities .

c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	background : individual - based models ( ibms ) are useful to simulate events subject to stochasticity and/or heterogeneity , and have become well established to model the potential ( re)emergence of pathogens ( e.g. , pandemic influenza , bioterrorism ) .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine - preventable childhood diseases ( e.g. , polio , measles ) are subject to stochasticity .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	even so it appears ibms for both these phenomena
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	are not well established .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	we review a decade of ibm publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages , pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	methods :
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	we systematically identified publications in web of science and pubmed from 2006 - 2015 based on title / abstract / keywords screening ( and full - text if necessary ) to retrieve topics , modeling purposes and general specifications .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	we extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine - preventable childhood diseases based on full - text screening .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	results :
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	we identified 698 papers , which applied an ibm for infectious disease transmission , and listed these in a reference database , describing their general characteristics .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	the diversity of disease - topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time ( 38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015 ) .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	the inclusion of intervention strategies ( 8 to 52 ) and economic consequences ( 1 to 20 ) are increasing , to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	unfortunately , terminology used to describe ibms is inconsistent and ambiguous .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	we retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine - preventable childhood disease ( covering 7 different diseases ) , with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008 .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	ibms have been useful to explore heterogeneous betweenand within - host interactions , but combined applications are still sparse .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	the amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	conclusions : ibms are suited to combine heterogeneous within - and between - host interactions , which offers many opportunities , especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	we advocate the exchange of ( open - source ) platforms and stress the need for consistent " branding " .
c9c920a8ab9b00d5c7982eacd9a4cfd02919caf3	using ( existing ) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross - fertilization between research groups and fields , and ultimately policy making in decades to come .

678c6fd1ee7fdf07055bbb00725a7c8526d8015e	various types of vaccines are under pre - clinical and clinical development to address the recent appearance of middle east respiratory syndrome or mers , an emerging infectious disease that has already caused over 600 deaths and remains a threat to world health .
678c6fd1ee7fdf07055bbb00725a7c8526d8015e	the causative agent for this respiratory disease is a member of the betacoronavirus genus , phylogenetically closely related to the sars coronavirus that caused an international health emergency in 2002 .
678c6fd1ee7fdf07055bbb00725a7c8526d8015e	with lessons learned from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , and with undeniable technological advances , vaccine development against mers was initially fast - paced and has produced several dna and protein vaccine candidates with promising results during early pre - clinical testing .
678c6fd1ee7fdf07055bbb00725a7c8526d8015e	at least one vaccine candidate has even entered firstin - humans clinical trials now .
678c6fd1ee7fdf07055bbb00725a7c8526d8015e	with the number of mers cases declining though and other infectious diseases attracting increased attention , the question remains , whether , similar to the situation after the sars pandemic , vaccine development is halted or remains the priority it rightfully should .
92fd1816e380b12f3759efc6c34e434e403f3225	a 6-month - old female iberian lynx ( lynx pardinus ) cub that was severely affected by mange died in september 2016 in the montes de toledo ( spain ) with crusts and fissures on its face , outer ears , nipples and footpads .
92fd1816e380b12f3759efc6c34e434e403f3225	the body condition of the cub was very poor , and it also had a mandibular abscess and a severely ankylosed luxation on its left knee .
92fd1816e380b12f3759efc6c34e434e403f3225	after confirming that the origin of the deceased cub 's dermal lesions was sarcoptes scabiei , the subsequent search for ectoparasites and a comparison of histopathological and immunohistochemical findings in all sympatric lynxes handled ( n = 30 ) and submitted for necropsy ( n = 4 ) during 2016 and 2017 revealed the presence of s. scabiei mites and/or milder mange compatible lesions in five members of her family group , which was treated against mange together with two exposed contiguous family groups .
92fd1816e380b12f3759efc6c34e434e403f3225	an elisa developed by the authors showed the presence of antibodies against s. scabiei in the deceased female cub and one brother .
92fd1816e380b12f3759efc6c34e434e403f3225	the presence of concomitant immunosuppressive factors in the dead female cub and the results obtained for the other sympatric lynxes studied since 2016 suggest that s. scabiei had a limited effect on immune - competent iberian lynxes in the local population of the montes de toledo .
92fd1816e380b12f3759efc6c34e434e403f3225	however , a different evolution and relevance of sarcoptic mange in different populations - or even in the same one in the presence of immunosuppressive factors - cannot be ruled out , thus confirming the need for further research in order to attain a complete comprehension of the epidemiology and the real threat that this ectoparasitic disease may imply for l. pardinus .

0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	the objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview , evaluation , and challenges of already available surveillance systems or datasets in the netherlands , which might be used for near real - time surveillance of severe respiratory infections .
0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	seven available surveillance systems or datasets in the netherlands were reviewed .
0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	the evaluation criteria , including data quality , timeliness , representativeness , simplicity , flexibility , acceptability and stability were based on united states centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and european centre for disease prevention and control ( ecdc ) guidelines for public health surveillance .
0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	we added sustainability as additional evaluation criterion .
0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	the best evaluated surveillance system or dataset currently available for sari surveillance is crude mortality monitoring , although it lacks specificity .
0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	in contrast to influenza - like illness ( ili ) in primary care , there is currently no gold standard for sari surveillance in the netherlands .
0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	based on our experience with sentinel sari surveillance , a fully or semi - automated , passive surveillance system seems most suited for a sustainable sari surveillance system .
0a4be9f048521079c802d449143d88bbb140c230	an important future challenge remains integrating sari surveillance into existing hospital programs in order to make surveillance data valuable for public health , as well as hospital quality of care management and individual patient care .

3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	published investigation mostly on sars - cov and to extent on mers has taught lessons to vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus .
3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	this is attributed to the fact that sars - cov-2 uses the same receptor as sars - cov on host cell i.e. human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( hace2 ) and is approximately 79 % similar genetically to sars -
3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	cov.
3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	though the efforts on covid-19 vaccines started very early , initially in china , as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world - over as the disease was declared a pandemic by who .
3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	but we will not be having an effective covid-19 vaccine before september , 2020 as per very optimistic estimates .
3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	this is because a successful covid-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high - risk individuals over the age of 60 , particularly those with chronic co - morbid conditions , frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries .
3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	various platforms for vaccine development are available namely : virus vectored vaccines , protein subunit vaccines , genetic vaccines , and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for sars - cov-2 , with each having discrete benefits and hindrances .
3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	the covid-19 pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted immune - potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this virus .
3c31b1dd002899846b274e39ae27424b1d7c1ea7	this review is aimed at providing an overview of the efforts dedicated to an effective vaccine for this novel coronavirus which has crippled the world in terms of economy , human health and life .

8a1c9aac07eb230a840ec6c81fff6c4318a31f07	the intestinal microbiota normally exist in a commensal or symbiotic relationship with the host , but in the neonate , and especially in the premature infant , this relationship needs to develop .
8a1c9aac07eb230a840ec6c81fff6c4318a31f07	alterations of the intestinal microbiota may predispose the preterm infant to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis .
8a1c9aac07eb230a840ec6c81fff6c4318a31f07	composition and quality of the intestinal microbiota depend on many factors , such as mode of birth , type of feeding , and use of antibiotics .
8a1c9aac07eb230a840ec6c81fff6c4318a31f07	there are many opportunities for physicians to provide interventions that could improve the adequate colonization of the neonatal gut .
8a1c9aac07eb230a840ec6c81fff6c4318a31f07	culture - based techniques are highly limited , but the development of new molecular technologies to study previously unidentified organisms has enhanced our understanding of the microbial environment that may predispose to necrotizing enterocolitis .

5e77c07596acbf98257f1aa272898f16f2b0ee0e	the developing embryo and its membranes provide the diversity of cell types that are needed for successful replication of a wide variety of different viruses .
5e77c07596acbf98257f1aa272898f16f2b0ee0e	within the family coronaviridae the embryonated egg has been used as a host system primarily for two avian coronaviruses within the genus gammacoronavirus , infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) and turkey coronavirus ( tcov ) .
5e77c07596acbf98257f1aa272898f16f2b0ee0e	the embryonated egg also has been shown to be suitable for isolation and propagation of pheasant coronavirus , a proposed member of the gammacoronavirus genus .
5e77c07596acbf98257f1aa272898f16f2b0ee0e	ibv and pheasant coronavirus replicate well in the embryonated chicken egg , regardless of inoculation route ; however , the allantoic route is favored as these viruses replicate well in epithelium lining the chorioallantoic membrane , with high virus titers found in these membranes and associated allantoic fl uids .
5e77c07596acbf98257f1aa272898f16f2b0ee0e	tcov replicates only in epithelium lining the embryo intestines and bursa of fabricius , thus amniotic inoculation is required for isolation and propagation of this virus .

d8eb14ca18661130fdaf099482d6cd5b46032efe	is a new serum biomarker for chronic hepatitis that was discovered by proteomics analysis .
d8eb14ca18661130fdaf099482d6cd5b46032efe	previous studies have shown that fic5.9 is derived from the c - terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain and the serum levels of fic5.9 decrease in chronic hepatitis .
d8eb14ca18661130fdaf099482d6cd5b46032efe	it also have been reported that fic5.9 can not be detected in the blood stream of the systemic circulation and it is released from fibrinogen during blood clotting in collecting tube .
d8eb14ca18661130fdaf099482d6cd5b46032efe	however , the mechanism of fic5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is unclear .
d8eb14ca18661130fdaf099482d6cd5b46032efe	we formulated a hypothesis that fic5.9 is released by enzymes that are activated by post - blood collection and may be coagulation and fibrinolysis factors .

e5a2d3550cfa6c07e3a376f03ce1cc135f87afe4	the results indicate that the use of bokashi as feed additives resulted in increased concentrations of pro - inflammatory cytokines
e5a2d3550cfa6c07e3a376f03ce1cc135f87afe4	tnf - α and il-6 , which increase the protective capacity of the colostrum by stimulating cellular immune mechanisms protecting the sow and neonates against infection .
e5a2d3550cfa6c07e3a376f03ce1cc135f87afe4	at the same time , the increased concentrations of cytokines il-4 , il-10 , tgf - β , and of immunoglobulins in the colostrum and milk from sows in the experimental group demonstrate the immunoregulatory effect of bokashi on th2 cells and may lead to increased expression of regulatory t cells and polarization of the immune response from th1 to th2 .

c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0	we conducted 7 targeted searches using web of science to identify key literature on important health conditions .
c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0	the resulting manuscripts underwent a 4-step appraisal process , and further manuscripts were sourced from reference lists .
c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0	this process resulted in a final sample of 70 articles that addressed cow and calf health .
c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0	sufficient literature was available to assess mastitis in cows , and scours , cryptosporidiosis , johne 's disease , pneumonia , immunity , and mortality in calves .
c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0	the results for cryptosporidiosis , pneumonia , immunity , and mortality were mixed , with some differences between studies likely attributable to flawed comparisons between cohorts .
c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0	overall , the articles addressing calf scours and mastitis pointed to beneficial or no effects of suckling .
c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0	the studies addressing johne 's disease did not find cow - calf contact to be a significant risk factor .

c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	the aim of this study was to analyze the changes in serum protein levels in the progression of hepatitis b using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation ( itraq ) analysis , in addition to comparing the serum protein levels of patients with chronic hepatitis b ( chb ) , patients with hepatitis b virus - induced acute - on - chronic liver failure ( hbv - induced aclf ) and normal individuals .
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	protein analysis was performed on 15 serum samples using itraq .
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	the study population included healthy controls ( n=5 ) , patients with chb ( n=5 ) and patients with hbv - induced aclf ( n=5 ) .
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	western blotting was used to verify the results in an additional nine serum samples from healthy controls , patients with chb and patients with hbv - induced aclf ( n=3 , respectively ) .
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	using itraq analysis , 16 different serum proteins with ≥1.5-fold differences in expression levels were identified in the patients with chb and aclf compared with the healthy controls .
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	five of those proteins , c - reactive protein precursor , hemoglobin β chain variant
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	hb s - wake , apolipoprotein j precursor , platelet factor 4 precursor and vitronectin , which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases , were subsequently verified using western blotting .
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	the western blotting results were consistent with the results from the itraq .
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	two of the five proteins are not classified by biological process , and the biological functions of all the proteins in hbv - induced aclf remain unclear .
c8973a511fb65247ed8f08c777512f17d5c4e977	this preliminary study demonstrated that a correlation between the expression of various serum proteins and the different pathogenetic conditions induced by hbv may exist .

a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	zika virus ( zikv ) has received widespread attention because of its effect on the developing fetus .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	it is becoming apparent , however , that severe neurological sequelae , such as guillian - barrë syndrome ( gbs ) , myelitis , encephalitis , and seizures can occur after infection of adults .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	this study demonstrates that a contemporary strain of zikv can widely infect astrocytes and neurons in the brain and spinal cord of adult , interferon α / β receptor knockout mice ( ag129 strain ) and cause progressive hindlimb paralysis , as well as severe seizurelike activity during the acute phase of disease .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	the severity of hindlimb motor deficits correlated with increased numbers of zikv - infected lumbosacral spinal motor neurons and decreased numbers of spinal motor neurons .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	electrophysiological compound muscle action potential ( cmap ) amplitudes in response to stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord were reduced when obvious motor deficits were present .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	zikv immunoreactivity was high , intense , and obvious in tissue sections of the brain and spinal cord .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	infection in the brain and spinal cord was also associated with astrogliosis as well as t cell and neutrophil infiltration .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	cmap and histological analysis indicated that peripheral nerve and muscle func - tions were intact .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	consequently , motor deficits in these circumstances appear to be primarily due to myelitis and possibly encephalitis as opposed to a peripheral neuropathy or a gbs - like syndrome .
a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	thus , acute zikv infection of adult ag129 mice may be a useful model for zikv - induced myelitis , encephalitis , and seizure activity .
f2ae2405ecb14e7d58087a201c46881a8eef6e92	apart from direct detection of the infecting organisms or biomarker of the pathogen itself , surrogate host markers are also useful for sensitive and early diagnosis of pathogenic infections .
f2ae2405ecb14e7d58087a201c46881a8eef6e92	early detection of pathogenic infections , discrimination among closely related diseases with overlapping clinical manifestations , and monitoring of disease progression can be achieved by analyzing blood biomarkers .
f2ae2405ecb14e7d58087a201c46881a8eef6e92	therefore , over the last decade large numbers of proteomics studies have been conducted to identify differentially expressed human serum / plasma proteins in different infectious diseases with the intent of discovering novel potential diagnostic / prognostic biomarkers .
f2ae2405ecb14e7d58087a201c46881a8eef6e92	however , in - depth review of the literature indicates that many reported biomarkers are altered in the same way in multiple infectious diseases , regardless of the type of infection .
f2ae2405ecb14e7d58087a201c46881a8eef6e92	this might be a consequence of generic acute phase reactions , while the uniquely modulated candidates in different pathogenic infections could be indicators of some specific responses .
f2ae2405ecb14e7d58087a201c46881a8eef6e92	in this review article , we will provide a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed serum / plasma proteins in various infectious diseases and categorize the protein markers associated with generic or specific responses .
f2ae2405ecb14e7d58087a201c46881a8eef6e92	the challenges associated with the discovery , validation , and translational phases of serum / plasma biomarker establishment are also discussed .

dc16bda747bf057fc2d5f0a433dc709f369e6720	programmed frameshifting is a recoding event in which a ribosome shifts reading frame by one or more nucleotides at a specific mrna signal between overlapping genes .
dc16bda747bf057fc2d5f0a433dc709f369e6720	programmed frameshifting is involved in the expression of many genes in a wide range of organisms , especially in viruses and bacteria .

6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	the aim of our work was to better understand misclassification errors in identification of true cases of covid-19 and to study the impact of these errors in epidemic curves .
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	we examined publically available time - series data of laboratory tests for sars - cov-2 viral infection , the causal agent for covid-19 , to try to explore , using a bayesian approach , about the sensitivity and specificity of the pcr - based diagnostic test .

6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	we applied these insights to uncertainty / bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity .
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	if the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95 % , the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95 % confidence intervals of the observed counts .
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	however , bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced , if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60 - 70 % range .
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	in the extreme scenario , hundreds of undiagnosed cases , even among tested , are possible , potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self - isolate .
6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625	the best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of covid-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves , a task for which the bayesian method we presented is well - suited .

0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	as the recent covid-19 outbreak rapidly expands all over the world , various containment measures have been carried out to fight against the covid-19 pandemic .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	in mainland china , the containment measures consist of three types , i.e. , wuhan travel ban , intra - city quarantine and isolation , and inter - city travel restriction .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	in order to carry out the measures , local economy and information acquisition play an important role .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	in this paper , we investigate the correlation of local economy and the information acquisition on the execution of containment measures to fight against the covid-19 pandemic in mainland china .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	first , we use a parsimonious model , i.e. , sir - x model , to estimate the parameters , which represent the execution of intra - city quarantine and isolation in major cities of mainland china .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	in order to understand the execution of intra - city quarantine and isolation , we analyze the correlation between the representative parameters including local economy , mobility , and information acquisition .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	to this end , we collect the data of gross domestic product ( gdp ) , the inflows from wuhan and outflows , and the covid-19 related search frequency from a widely - used web mapping service , i.e. , baidu maps , and web search engine , i.e. , baidu search engine , in mainland china .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	based on the analysis , we confirm the strong correlation between the local economy and the execution of information acquisition in major cities of mainland china .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	we further evidence that , although the cities with high gdp per capita attracts bigger inflows from wuhan , people are more likely to conduct the quarantine measure and to reduce going out to other cities .
0373565c1bce0d7c6abc1c86cf3725c45ddf8e79	finally , the correlation analysis using search data shows that well - informed individuals are likely to carry out containment measures .

013e6a43d4515dbb6c6eec44918cad6cd8dc7d19	immunity passports could , however , be used to achieve collective benefits and benefits for specific populations besides facilitating economic recovery .
013e6a43d4515dbb6c6eec44918cad6cd8dc7d19	we conclude that sector - based policies that prioritize access to testing based on societal need are likely to be fairer and logistically more feasible , while minimizing stigma and reducing incentives for fraud .
013e6a43d4515dbb6c6eec44918cad6cd8dc7d19	clear guidelines need to be set out for which sectors of society should be prioritized for testing , and rigorous mechanisms should be in place to validate test results and identify cases of reinfection .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	introduction :
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	bleeding is the most frequent complication in patients receiving venoarterial or venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	recombinant activated factor vii ( rfviia ) has been used in these patients with conflicting results .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	we describe our experience with rfviia for refractory bleeding in this setting and review the cases reported in the literature .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	methods :
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	clinical characteristics , demographics , bleeding , thrombotic complications , mortality , and rfviia administration were retrospectively collected for analysis from the electronic charts of the 15 patients in our intensive care unit who received rfviia while being given ecmo from results : fifteen patients received rfviia for persistent bleeding under venoarterial ( n = 11 ) or venovenous ( n = 4 ) ecmo .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	bleeding dramatically decreased in 14 patients , without a major thrombotic event , except in one patient in whom a major stroke could not be ruled out .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	two circuits were changed within the 48 hours after rfviia administration for clots in the membrane and decreased oxygenation but without massive clotting .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	the mortality rate was 60 % .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	conclusions :
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	rfviia use for intractable hemorrhaging in patients receiving ecmo controlled bleeding , without major thrombotic events , and with 60 % dying .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	hence , its use warrants discussion , and clinicians should be aware of the possibility of potentially life - threatening systemic thrombosis , emboli , or circuit clotting .
5be26f67b254872a000514073106a54836653746	whether rfviia can save the lives of such patients remains to be determined .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	background :
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	there are no known medicines or vaccines to control the covid-19 pandemic caused by sars - cov-2 ( ncov ) .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	antiviral peptides are superior to conventional drugs and may also be effective against covid-19 .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	hence , we investigated the sars - cov-2 spike receptor - binding domain ( ncov - rbd ) that interacts with hace2 for viral attachment and entry .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	methods :
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	three strategies and bioinformatics approaches were employed to design potential ncov - rbd -hace2 interaction - blocking peptides that may restrict viral attachment and entry .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	firstly , the key residues interacting with ncov - rbd -hace2 are identified and hace2 sequence - based peptides are designed .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	second , peptides from five antibacterial peptide databases that block ncov - rbd are identified ; finally , a chimeric peptide design approach is used to design peptides that can bind to key ncov - rbd residues .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	the final peptides are selected based on their physiochemical properties , numbers and positions of key residues binding , binding energy , and antiviral properties .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	results
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	: we found that : ( i ) three amino acid stretches in hace2 interact with ncov - rbd ; ( ii )
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	effective peptides must bind to three key positions of ncov - rbd ( gly485 / phe486 / asn487 , gln493 , and gln498 / thr500 / asn501 ) ; ( iii ) phe486 , gln493 , and asn501 are critical residues ; ( iv )
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	ac20 and ac23 derived from hace2 may block two key critical positions ; ( iv ) dbp6 identified from databases can block the three sites of the ncov - rbd and interacts with one critical position , gln498 ; ( v )
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	seven chimeric peptides were considered promising , among which cncovp-3 , cncovp-4 , and cncovp-7 are the top three ; and ( vi )
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	cncovp-4 meets all the criteria and is the best peptide .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	conclusions :
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	to conclude , using three different bioinformatics approaches , we identified 17 peptides that can potentially bind to the ncov - rbd that interacts with hace2 .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	binding these peptides to ncov - rbd may potentially inhibit the virus to access hace2 and thereby may prevent the infection .
504b3395aca0e3fa070031ecc89eb57abd671090	out of 17 , 10 peptides have promising potential and need further experimental validation .

21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	users play a critical role in the creation and propagation of fake news online by consuming and sharing articles with inaccurate information either intentionally or unintentionally .
21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	fake news are written in a way to confuse readers and therefore understanding which articles contain fabricated information is very challenging for non - experts .
21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	given the difficulty of the task , several fact checking websites have been developed to raise awareness about which articles contain fabricated information .
21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	as a result of those platforms , several users are interested to share posts that cite evidence with the aim to refute fake news and warn other users .
21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	these users are known as fact checkers .
21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	however , there are users who tend to share false information , who can be characterised as potential fake news spreaders .
21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	in this paper , we propose the checkerorspreader model that can classify a user as a potential fact checker or a potential fake news spreader .
21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	our model is based on a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) and combines word embeddings with features that represent users ' personality traits and linguistic patterns used in their tweets .
21c391666b2c50270649338b73448d72d8d52bd0	experimental results show that leveraging linguistic patterns and personality traits can improve the performance in differentiating between checkers and spreaders .

085e1ec703d9c3dbecc8215da79b187530db1cfc	the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat sars - cov-2 infection is controversial and its mode of action poorly understood .
085e1ec703d9c3dbecc8215da79b187530db1cfc	we demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level and is accompanied by profound changes in the cellular lipidome as well as reduced expression of interferon - stimulated genes .
085e1ec703d9c3dbecc8215da79b187530db1cfc	trained immunity comprises a functional adaptation induced by epigenetic reprogramming which facilitates the anti - viral innate immune response .
085e1ec703d9c3dbecc8215da79b187530db1cfc	our findings therefore suggest that hydroxychloroquine may not have a beneficial effect on the anti - viral immune response to sars - cov-2 .

8f4394df7ac3ad73f0bd696f98d45ba6c04a44d7	this review summarizes recent experimental achievements in the area of the development of new rna interference ( rnai ) therapeutics for the treatment of viral respiratory diseases .
8f4394df7ac3ad73f0bd696f98d45ba6c04a44d7	delivery of short interfering rna ( sirna ) to their intended target tissue remains the biggest problem for most therapeutic applications of these compounds .
8f4394df7ac3ad73f0bd696f98d45ba6c04a44d7	appropriate formulations and chemical modifications for improved stability will boost the probability of utilization of rnai drugs in the clinical applications .

bbb91f2052b3c4e9816269336c38dc857f527b5d	we reviewed the literature to assess timing of enteral feeding after nec using fixed effects models .
bbb91f2052b3c4e9816269336c38dc857f527b5d	results three studies met inclusion criteria ; no randomized trials .
bbb91f2052b3c4e9816269336c38dc857f527b5d	after removal of bell 's stage i infants , the earlier refeeding group ( < 5 - 7 or median 4 days ) included 79 infants and later refeeding group ( ≥5 - 7 or median 10 days ) included 119 infants .
bbb91f2052b3c4e9816269336c38dc857f527b5d	pooled analysis revealed earlier re - initiation reduced the incidence in the composite outcome of recurrent nec and/or post - nec stricture (

bbb91f2052b3c4e9816269336c38dc857f527b5d	there was no increase in negative outcomes with earlier refeeding after nec .
bbb91f2052b3c4e9816269336c38dc857f527b5d	earlier initiation of enteral feeds resulted in a significantly lower risk for the combined outcome of recurrent nec and/or post - nec stricture .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	traffic junctions are one of the crowded places where commuters are at high risk of developing respiratory infections , due to their greater exposure to airborne and human transmitted microbial pathogens .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	an airborne bioaerosol assessment study was carried out at a high traffic density junction focusing on their concentration , contribution in respirable particulate matter ( pm ) , and factors influencing the distribution and microbial diversity .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	andersen six - stage viable cascade impactor and a wide - range aerosol spectrometer were used for microbial and particulate matter measurements , respectively .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between bioaerosol concentration , vehicular count , pm concentration , and meteorological parameters .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	the mean bacteria concentration ( 1962.95
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	± 651.85 cfu / m 3 ) was significantly different than fungi ( 1118.95 ± 428.34 cfu / m 3 )
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	( p < 0.05 ) .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	the temporal distribution showed maximum concentration for bacteria and fungi during monsoon and postmonsoon seasons , respectively .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	in terms of bioaerosol loading , a considerable fraction of fungi ( 3.25 % ) and bacteria ( 5.65 % ) contributed to the total airborne pm .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	most abundant bioaerosols were aspergillus ( 27.58 % ) , penicillium ( 23 % ) , and cladosporium ( 14.05 % ) ( fungi ) , and micrococcus ( 25.73 % ) , staphylococcus ( 17.98 % ) , and bacillus ( 13.8 % ) ( bacteria ) .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	trafficinduced roadside soil resuspension and microbial aerosolizations from the human body were identified as the chief sources of bioaerosol emissions .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	the risk of lower respiratory tract infections caused by anthroponotic ( human transmitted ) transfer of bacterial pathogens is very high .
9957b4db7aa7da8f192339b4f820a51fd209fcd8	the results of the study can be used to trace sources of microbial mediated communicable diseases , and to recommend appropriate safety measures to avoid pathogenic bioaerosol exposure .
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	mouse hepatitis virus strain a59 ( mhv - a59 )
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	triggers various pathologies in several mouse strains , including hypergammaglobulinaemia , hepatitis and thymus involution .
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	we reported previously the presence of autoantibodies ( autoab ) to liver and kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	( fah ) in sera from mice infected with mhv - a59 .
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	long - term mhv - infected mice represented a good model of non - pathogenic autoimmune response since the animals were apparently healthy in spite of the presence of autoab .
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	the aim of this work was to see whether a severe liver injury , which releases endogenous adjuvants , i.e. danger signals , could elicit a broader spectrum of autoab and perhaps signs of autoimmune hepatitis .
6c77fe6b83910911457a7defea895ac60c1e647b	carbon tetrachloride ( ccl 4 ) was injected into mice 30 days after mhv infection , and serum was assayed for autoab and total igg 20 days later .

6b80c9445423f4e8ea6e1898dedccf12aaae4d40	the development of blockchain technologies has enabled the trustless execution of so - called smart contracts , i.e. programs that regulate the exchange of assets ( e.g. , cryptocurrency ) between users .
6b80c9445423f4e8ea6e1898dedccf12aaae4d40	in a decentralized blockchain , the state of smart contracts is collaboratively maintained by a peer - to - peer network of mutually untrusted nodes , which collect from users a set of transactions ( representing the required actions on contracts ) , and execute them in some order .
6b80c9445423f4e8ea6e1898dedccf12aaae4d40	once this sequence of transactions is appended to the blockchain , the other nodes validate it , re - executing the transactions in the same order .

5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	motivated by the need for novel robust approaches to modelling the covid-19 epidemic , this paper treats a population of n individuals as an inhomogeneous random social network ( irsn ) .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	the nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	an epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily , triggered on day 0 by a seed infection introduced into the population .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	individuals ' social behaviour and health status are assumed to be random , with probability distributions that vary with their type .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	first a formulation and analysis is given for the basic si ( " susceptible - infective " ) network contagion model , which focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	the main result is an analytical formula valid in the large n limit for the state of the system on day t in terms of the initial conditions .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	the formula involves only one - dimensional integration .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	next , more realistic sir and seir network models , including " removed " ( r ) and " exposed " ( e ) classes , are formulated .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	these models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for the si network model .
5bbb857e2d1c399eccdcb348d16a7e5659713480	the framework can be easily adapted for analysis of different kinds of public health interventions , including vaccination , social distancing and quarantine .

14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	purpose -the purpose of this paper is to show that 2009 h1n1 " swine " influenza pandemic vaccination policies deviated from predictions established in the theory of political survival , and to propose that pandemic response deviated because it was ruled by bureaucratized experts rather than by elected politicians .

14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	, the paper employs descriptive statistical analysis of vaccination policies in nine western democracies .
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	to probe the plausibility of the novel explanation , it uses quantitative and qualitative content analyses of media attention and coverage in two deviant cases , the usa and denmark .

14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	linking political survival to disaster responses find little empirical support in the substantial cross - country variations of vaccination responses during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic .
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	rather than following a political logic , the case studies of media coverage in the usa and denmark demonstrate that the response was bureaucratized in the public health agencies ( cdc and dmha , respectively ) .
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	hence , while natural disaster responses appear to follow a political logic , the response to pandemics appears to be more strongly instituted in the hands of bureaucratic experts .
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	research limitations / implications -there is an added value of encompassing bureaucratic dynamics in political theories of disaster response ; bureaucratized expertise proved to constitute a strong plausible explanation of the 2009 pandemic vaccination response .
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	practical implications -pandemic
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	preparedness and response depends critically on understanding the lessons of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic ; a key lesson supported by this paper is that expert - based agencies rather than political leaders are the pivotal actors .
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	originality / value -this paper is the first to pinpoint the limitations of political survival theories of disaster responses with respect to the 2009 pandemic .
14d6f0a1a52cf5ab010f2edd89c941c3498f40fb	further , it is among the few to analyze the causes of variations in cross - country pandemic vaccination policies during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic .

13a4001b232c5ebb12820ebf7a2beca29f2c52b6	clinical data from 488 cats with histopathologically confirmed feline infectious peritonitis ( fip ) and 620 comparable controls were evaluated retrospectively to assess the value of several diagnostic tests frequently used in the evaluation of cats with suspected fip .
13a4001b232c5ebb12820ebf7a2beca29f2c52b6	diagnostic utility of serum albumin to globulin ratio for the diagnosis of fip was greater than of the utility of serum total protein and ␥ -globulin concentrations .

13a4001b232c5ebb12820ebf7a2beca29f2c52b6	the positive and negative predictive values of presence of anti - coronavirus antibodies were 0.44 and 0.90 , respectively , antibody concentrations ( 1 : 1,600 ) were 0.94 and 0.88 , presence of immune complexes measured by a competitive enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay were 0.67 and 0.84 , and detection of viral rna by serum reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) were 0.90 and 0.47 .
13a4001b232c5ebb12820ebf7a2beca29f2c52b6	effusion rt - pcr was performed in 6 cats ; it was positive in all 5 cats with fip and negative in the cat with another disease .
13a4001b232c5ebb12820ebf7a2beca29f2c52b6	diagnostic assays on the fluid in cats with body effusion had good predictive values .
13a4001b232c5ebb12820ebf7a2beca29f2c52b6	definitive diagnosis of fip on the basis of measurement of various variables in serum was not possible .
13a4001b232c5ebb12820ebf7a2beca29f2c52b6	serum tests can only be used to facilitate the decision for more invasive diagnostic methods .

2d3e4cc0e477c431b1c7b98be0175f4d30462959	currently , most analysis and simulation techniques require to unfold the given coloured petri net into its corresponding plain , uncoloured petri net representation .
2d3e4cc0e477c431b1c7b98be0175f4d30462959	this unfolding step is rather straightforward for finite discrete colour sets , but tends to be time - consuming due to the potentially huge number of possible transition bindings .

9ebc09cec2a54ebc2629bf09e02a6c19493fc750	the " up " ctd1 exposes the receptor - binding site for ace2 engagement , suggesting that the conformations 2 - 4 represent a receptor - binding active state .
9ebc09cec2a54ebc2629bf09e02a6c19493fc750	this conformational change is also required for the binding of sars - cov neutralizing antibodies targeting the ctd1 .
9ebc09cec2a54ebc2629bf09e02a6c19493fc750	this phenomenon could be extended to other betacoronaviruses utilizing ctd1 of the s1 subunit for receptor binding , which provides new insights into the intermediate states of coronavirus pre - fusion spike trimer during infection .

02615ffd9898d5abf64271c90647c7466b1188ee	a consistent and holistic approach , however , has previously been lacking in both research and practice .
02615ffd9898d5abf64271c90647c7466b1188ee	scholars of natural sciences and social sciences address the subject differently , so do academics and practitioners ; and compartmentalization often characterizes different regions , departments and organizations ' responses to emergencies .

abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	the covid-19 pandemic has forced societies across the world to resort to social distancing to slow the spread of the sars - cov-2 virus .
abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	due to the economic impacts of social distancing , there is growing desire to relax these measures .
abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	to characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences , we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of sars - cov-2 transmission .
abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated , we calibrated our model to data from the us and focused our analysis on optimal controls from may 2020 through december 2021 .
abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	we found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in may 2020 .
abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	strategies that maintain control at a high level until summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths , whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity .
abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling covid-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty , including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing .
abb6e8d359bfe7356e7b0c6f7e9c6ed596a8d8e3	in light of those uncertainties , our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control .

192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	health promotion and security of manpower in a society is one of the pillars to progress a society .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	anxiety , is the most common psychological disorder in societies and occupations like nursing ‚ anesthesia technicians and operation room technicians .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	the aim of this study was to investigate prevalence of anxiety , and its severity in iranian nurses working in operation room .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	also , we determined the most important associated factors with anxiety .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	in this cross sectional study ‚ 152 nurses working in operating room participated .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	the tool to gather the data was a questionnaire , that included three parts ; demographic information ‚ obvious anxiety questions and hidden anxiety questions of spielburger .

192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	the majority of participants were females ( 94.7 % ) with experience at work less than 10 years ( 84.9 % ) .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	the average scores of participants in obvious and hidden anxiety were 41.9±39.4

192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	( range 20 to 70 ) , respectively .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	anxiety level was significantly higher in females than males ( p=0.04 ) .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	the most prevalent cause of anxiety , was contact with infected biological factors ( 23 % of nurses ) .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	the less important cause was concern about retirement ( 42.8 % of nurses ) .
192e7d37cf521798de0394c2ad593f2bb77f5a77	our results suggest that , anxiety disorders is prevalent in iranian nurses working in public city hospitals , which warrants immediate programs for intervention to improve working situations in work place .

0750fc2885593b95ee08d4675afe24c13ab4fa42	super learner algorithm can be applied to combine results of multiple base learners to improve quality of predictions .
0750fc2885593b95ee08d4675afe24c13ab4fa42	the default method for verification of super learner results is by nested cross validation ; however , this technique is very expensive computationally .
0750fc2885593b95ee08d4675afe24c13ab4fa42	it has been proposed by tsamardinos et al . , that nested cross validation can be replaced by resampling for tuning hyper - parameters of the learning algorithms .
0750fc2885593b95ee08d4675afe24c13ab4fa42	the main contribution of this study is to apply this idea to verification of super learner .
0750fc2885593b95ee08d4675afe24c13ab4fa42	we compare the new method with other verification methods , including nested cross validation .
0750fc2885593b95ee08d4675afe24c13ab4fa42	tests were performed on artificial data sets of diverse size and on seven real , biomedical data sets .
0750fc2885593b95ee08d4675afe24c13ab4fa42	the resampling method , called bootstrap bias correction , proved to be a reasonably precise and very cost - efficient alternative for nested cross validation .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	background .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	the rising covid-19 pandemic caused many governments to impose policies restricting social interactions .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	these policies have slowed down the spread of the sars - cov-2 virus to the extent that restrictions can be gradually lifted .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	models can be useful to assess the consequences of deconfinement strategies with respect to business , school and leisure activities .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	methods .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	we adapted the individual - based model " stride " to simulate interactions between the 11 million inhabitants of belgium at the levels of households , workplaces , schools and communities .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	we calibrated our model to observed hospital incidence and seroprevalence data .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	stride can explore contact tracing options and account for repetitive leisure contacts in extended household settings ( so called " household bubbles " ) with varying levels of connectivity .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	findings .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	household bubbles have the potential to reduce the number of covid-19 hospital admissions by up to 90 % .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	the effectiveness of contact tracing depends on its timing , as it becomes futile more than 4 days after the index case developed symptoms .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	assuming that children have a lower level of susceptibility and lower probability to experience symptomatic sars - cov-2 infection , ( partial ) school closure options have relatively little impact on covid-19 burden .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	interpretation .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	not only the absolute number and intensity of physical contacts drive the transmission dynamics and covid-19 burden , also their repetitiveness is influential .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	contact tracing seems essential for a controlled and persistent release of lockdown measures , but requires timely compliance to testing , reporting and self - isolation .
7ad2bef1af93f50b80bc136c709a081f8a4ac4e5	rapid tracing and testing , and communication ensuring continued involvement of the population are therefore essential .
4d05de6afc581f05e02d638a89f63a4bfc9d1dcb	the main challenge of technology is to facilitate the tasks and to transfer the functions that are usually performed by the humans to the nonhumans .
4d05de6afc581f05e02d638a89f63a4bfc9d1dcb	however , the pervasion of machines in everyday life requires that the non - humans are increasingly closer in their abilities to the ordinary thought , action and behaviour of the humans .
4d05de6afc581f05e02d638a89f63a4bfc9d1dcb	this view merges the idea of the humaniter , a longstanding myth in the history of technology : an artificial creature that thinks , acts and feels like a human to the point that one can not make the difference between the two .
4d05de6afc581f05e02d638a89f63a4bfc9d1dcb	in the wake of the opposition of strong ai and weak ai , this challenge can be expressed in terms of a shift from the performance of intelligence ( reason , reasoning , cognition , judgment ) to that of sentience ( experience , sensation , emotion , consciousness ) .
4d05de6afc581f05e02d638a89f63a4bfc9d1dcb	in other words , the challenge of technology if this possible shift is taken seriously is to move from the paradigm of artificial intelligence ( ai ) to that of artificial sentience ( as ) .
4d05de6afc581f05e02d638a89f63a4bfc9d1dcb	but for the humaniter not to be regarded as a mere myth , any intelligent or sentient machine must pass through a test of humanity that refers to or that differs from the turing test .
4d05de6afc581f05e02d638a89f63a4bfc9d1dcb	one can suggest several options for this kind of test and also point out some conditions and limits to the very idea of the humaniter as an artificial human .
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	in a world where climate change , vector expansion , human activity , and pathogen dispersal do not respect boundaries , the human - animal - pathogen interface has become less defined .
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	consequently , a one health approach to disease surveillance and control has generated much interest across several disciplines .
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	this systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease , and critically appraises how this may be applied within canada .
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	results highlighted a bias in research from highand middle - income - economy countries , with 35 % of the studies describing data from the latin america / caribbean region , 25 % from north america , and 11 % from the european / central asia region .
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	bacteria were the most studied type of infectious agent , followed by protozoa , viruses , helminths , and fungi .
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	only six out of 142 studies described disease in canada :
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	four researched a variety of pathogens within indigenous communities , one researched borrelia burgdorferi in british columbia , and one researched arboviruses in quebec .
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious - disease pathogens in canada , yet are currently overlooked .
a95452bb03845776e74c5af3dd628cb5c25a02aa	further research into the use of dog - sentinel surveillance is specifically recommended for california serogroup viruses , chikungunya virus , west nile virus , lyme borreliosis , rickettsia spp .

c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	health workers globally are at elevated occupational risk of tuberculosis infection and disease .
c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	while a raft of guidelines have been published over the past 25 years on infection prevention and control ( ipc ) in healthcare , studies in different settings continue to show inadequate implementation and persistence of risk .
c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	the aim of this commentary is to argue , based on the literature and our own research , that a comprehensive occupational health approach is an essential complement to ipc guidelines .
c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	such an approach includes a health system framework focusing on upstream or mediating components , such as a statutory regulation , leadership , an information system , and staff trained in protective disciplines .
c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	within the classical prevention framework , primary prevention needs to be complemented by occupational health services ( secondary prevention ) and worker 's compensation ( tertiary prevention ) .
c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	a worker - centric approach recognises the ethical implications of screening health workers , as well as the stigma perceived by those diagnosed with tuberculosis .
c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	it also provides for the voiced experience of health workers and their participation in decision - making .
c5f23e5a56e8d2a70a6fa5f41d6d27097e1288e3	we argue that such a comprehensive approach will contribute to both the prevention of occupational tuberculosis and to the ability of a health system to withstand other crises of infectious hazards to its workforce .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	the human lung comprises about 300 million alveoli which are located on bronchioles between the 17th to 24th generations of the acinar tree , with a progressively higher population density in the deeper branches ( lower acini ) .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	the alveolar size and aspect ratio change with generation number .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	due to successive bifurcation , the flow velocity magnitude also decreases as the bronchiole diameter decreases from the upper to lower acini .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	as a result , fluid dynamic parameters such as reynolds ( re ) and womersley ( a ) numbers progressively decrease with increasing generation number .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	in order to characterize alveolar flow patterns and inhaled particle transport during synchronous ventilation , we have conducted measurements for a range of dimensionless parameters physiologically relevant to the upper acini .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	acinar airflow patterns were measured using a simplified in vitro alveolar model consisting of a single transparent elastic truncated sphere ( representing the alveolus ) mounted over a circular hole on the side of a rigid circular tube ( representing the bronchiole ) .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	the model alveolus was capable of expanding and contracting inphase with the oscillatory flow through the bronchiole thereby simulating synchronous ventilation .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	realistic breathing conditions were achieved by exercising the model over a range of progressively varying geometric and dynamic parameters to simulate the environment within several generations of the acinar tree .
960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831	particle image velocimetry was used to measure the resulting flow patterns .

c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	autophagy is an evolutionary conserved catabolic process that allows for the degradation of intracellular components by lysosomes .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	this process can be triggered by nutrient deprivation , microbial infections or other challenges to promote cell survival under these stressed conditions .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	however , basal levels of autophagy are also crucial for the maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis by ensuring the selective removal of protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	a tight regulation of this process is essential for cellular survival and organismal health .

c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	here , we chose to focus on the role of dubs related to the regulation of autophagy and cargo lysosomal degradation .

c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	a brief overview autophagy was first described in 1966 by c. de duve and r. wattiaux based on observations from mammalian cells deprived of serum and amino acids [ 21 ] .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	the name autophagy was coined later , after electron microscopy observations that revealed the presence of double - membrane vesicles containing part of the cytoplasm .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	autophagy can be induced in response to various stressors such as lack of nutrients or growth factors , hypoxia , or infection [ 22 ] .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	as such , autophagy was initially described as a survival mechanism in response to various stresses .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	however , it is now widely recognized that basal levels of autophagy also operate independently of any stress , contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by the removal of dysfunctional or unnecessary proteins and organelles ( for instance , mitochondria ) and ribosomes [ 2 ] .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	one can distinguish three types of autophagy : macroautophagy ( mostly referred to as autophagy ) , chaperone - mediated autophagy and microautophagy .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	these autophagy processes differ by the way substrates are being delivered to the lysosome for degradation .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	in macroautophagy , autophagy substrates are isolated from the cytoplasm through their engulfment in double - membrane vesicles called autophagosomes [ 23 ] .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	autophagosomes are formed by the elongation of an isolation membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum [ 24 ] .

c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	in microautophagy , cytosolic substrates are transferred to the lysosome through direct invagination of the lysosomal membrane ( in yeast ) or from the late endosomes ( in mammals and drosophila , referred to as endosomal - microautophagy ) that eventually fuse with the lysosomes [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	as for chaperone - mediated autophagy , endosomal - microautophagy requires the chaperone protein hsc70 for the selection of the substrates [ 28 , 30 , 31 ] .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	the major components of the autophagy machinery are the atg ( autophagy - related gene ) proteins , which are required for the formation and maturation of the autophagosome ( figure 1 ) .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	atg proteins form specific macromolecular complexes acting at several steps of autophagosome formation and regulating different stages of the autophagy process [ 23 ] .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	autophagy induction by starvation is controlled by the tor ( target of rapamycin ) complex 1 , which is an essential signaling pathway for the sensing of nutrient availability [ 32 ] .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	lack of nutrients leads to the down - regulation of tor activity , resulting in the activation of the ulk1 / atg1 complex .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	the activation of the ulk1 complex then initiates autophagy by recruiting other atg proteins to the nascent autophagosome .

c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	beclin1 , a multivalent adaptor , is one major component of the pi3k - iii complex .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	the expansion of the autophagosomal membrane requires two ubiquitin - like conjugation cascades : the atg12-conjugation system and the atg8 / lc3-conjugation system .
c9cf89e7642b3da75a33d482d26a330212677479	the modification of the atg8 protein by lipidation and its anchorage in the autophagosome membrane is a hallmark of autophagy induction [ 34 ]

f2ff483d3cf8f491141f9cc2e3a26dddacd41b5d	rtrt - pcr successfully detected h1n1 swl clinical specimens and did not cross - react with seasonal influenza a , subtypes h1n1 and h3n2 viruses and swine influenza a ( h1n1 ) .
f2ff483d3cf8f491141f9cc2e3a26dddacd41b5d	the h1n1 swl matrix assay did cross react with h5n1 .
f2ff483d3cf8f491141f9cc2e3a26dddacd41b5d	the h1n1 swl matrix assay was then compared to two other assays using a dilution series and a panel of untyped influenza a positive clinical samples .
f2ff483d3cf8f491141f9cc2e3a26dddacd41b5d	these experiments found the assay to have a comparable sensitivity to the established universal influenza a rtrt - pcr and was more sensitive than the h1n1 swl specific assay that targeted the h1 region .
f2ff483d3cf8f491141f9cc2e3a26dddacd41b5d	conclusions :
f2ff483d3cf8f491141f9cc2e3a26dddacd41b5d	the results demonstrate that the rtrt - pcr is sensitive and should be used alongside existing universal influenza a assays to rapidly detect the novel h1n1 swl virus .

25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	endometrial receptivity is defined as a restricted period in the menstrual cycle during which the uterus is receptive to blastocyst attachment and implantation [ 7 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	innate pathology in the eutopic endometrium is suggested to contribute to implantation impairment in women with endometriosis with subfertility [ 8 - 10 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	progesterone resistance results in inadequate antagonism of estrogen action , increased inflammation , inadequate differentiation of the stroma , and remodeling of the endometrium , all of which can lead to a non - receptive endometrium for embryo implantation [ 11 ] .

25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	increased esr2 levels are directly related to esr2 promoter hypomethylation in endometriotic cells [ 12 , 13 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	esr2 represses esr1 expression by directly binding to its promoter , which can result in progesterone resistance [ 12 , 13 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	however , the complete repertoire of esr2 functions is believed to be more complicated .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	micrornas ( mirnas ) are approximately 22-nucleotide non - coding rnas that negatively regulate protein expression via translational inhibition or mrna degradation .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	emerging data suggest that dysregulation of mirna expression may be implicated in the development and pathogenesis of endometriosis [ 14 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	using microarray - based mirna
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	profiling , we previously found that 66 mature mirnas were differentially expressed ( 54 up - and 12 downregulated ) in mid - luteal eutopic endometrium from women with minimal / mild endometriosis as compared with normal endometrial tissues [ 15 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	specifically , mir-196a upregulated mek / erk signaling and mediated repressed pgr expression and decidualization of endometrial stromal cells ( escs ) from eutopic endometrium with endometriosis [ 15 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	likewise , upregulation of mir-194 - 3p in eutopic endometrium inhibited pgr expression and esc decidualization in endometriosis , which hinders fertility by repressing the levels of pgr and decidualization in the eutopic endometrium [ 16 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	we have also shown that mir23a and mirna23b are downregulated in endometriosis and they upregulate several unidentified genes required for steroidogenic factor 1 ( sf-1 ) expression in escs [ 17 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	bioinformatics analysis of a downregulated mirna , mir22 - 5p , revealed a binding site in the 3 0 -untranslated region ( 3 0 -utr ) of ten - eleven translocation 2 ( tet2 )

25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	the tet family encodes enzymes responsible for the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine ( 5mc ) to 5-hmc in dna demethylation .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	genome - wide analysis of endometriomas revealed significantly low tet gene expression associated with high 5-hmc levels upon in - vitro decidualization , suggesting a unique epigenetic regulation in these ectopic tissues [ 19 ] .
25bbd9b3477b12e9096439b04ece636b64568074	however , how tet2 affects minimal / mild endometriosis - related infertility and the specific mechanism are unknown .

9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	the time delay between the start of an influenza pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	we quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay , and assess how the delay may be extended by non - pharmaceutical interventions .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	methods and findings .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	the model constructed for this time delay accounts for : ( i ) epidemic growth in the source region , ( ii )
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at - risk country , ( iii )
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders , ( iv )
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	the possibility of in - flight transmission , ( v )
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic , and ( vi )
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	the delay until infection in the at - risk country gathers momentum .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic , and under favourable circumstances , could add several months to the delay .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	on the other hand , the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection , wearing a protective mask during travel , promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	elevated in - flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	conclusions .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	the delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at - risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at - risk country , and is little affected by nonpharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers .
9b7a0ad7b6c7f59e7a6cf1dc9d07912a273d19b5	short of preventing international travel altogether , eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country - to - country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza .

03e70a448d7fd2324949ab321c571ceeb13b452e	first , cases without symptoms suggest silent chains of transmission .
03e70a448d7fd2324949ab321c571ceeb13b452e	these cases are harder to detect , as they are less likely to present to healthcare facilities , and many testing criteria require the presence of symptoms .

1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) have been reported to use aminopeptidase n
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	( apn ) as a cellular receptor .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	recently , the role of apn as a receptor for pedv has been questioned .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	in our study , the role of apn in pedv and tgev infections was studied in primary porcine enterocytes .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	after seven days of cultivation , 89 % of enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two - to five - fold higher susceptibility to pedv and tgev .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	a significant increase of pedv and tgev infection was correlated with a higher expression of apn , which was indicative that apn plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	however , pedv and tgev infected both apn positive and negative enterocytes .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	pedv and tgev miller showed a higher infectivity in apn positive cells than in apn negative cells .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	in contrast , tgev purdue replicated better in apn negative cells .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	these results show that an additional receptor exists , different from apn for porcine coronaviruses .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	subsequently , treatment of enterocytes with neuraminidase ( na ) had no effect on infection efficiency of tgev , implying that terminal cellular sialic acids ( sas ) are no receptor determinants for tgev .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	treatment of tgev with na significantly enhanced the infection which shows that tgev is masked by sas .

1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	it contains an n - terminal ectodomain ( s1 ) and a short c - terminal cytoplasmic tail ( s2 ) .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	it is known that the peripheral s1 portion is a globular cellular receptor binding subunit while the transmembrane s2 portion is required to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes [ 1 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	the s protein also contains important antigenic determinants for coronaviruses .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	the triple - spanning m protein has a short n - terminal glycosylated domain , a long c - terminal domain , and three transmembrane domains [ 2 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	m proteins play key roles in virion assembly / budding .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	the lateral interactions between m and e proteins are supposed to mediate the formation of the virion envelope .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	the m - s protein interactions are also needed to retain the spike proteins at the budding site , incorporating the s proteins into the viral envelope [ 3 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	the e protein is a small hydrophobic protein of 9 - 12 kda .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	it plays crucial roles during virus budding and transiently localizes at the pre - golgi compartment before progressing to the golgi apparatus .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	deletion of the e protein in tgev arrests virus transportation and maturation [ 4 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	the e protein possesses an ion channel activity , contributing to virus virulence and pathogenesis [ 5 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	the replication of viruses in their host cells is firstly mediated by the virus binding to the cellular receptors .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	some alphacoronaviruses , including human coronavirus 229e
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	( hcov-229e ) , feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) , canine coronavirus ( ccov ) , tgev , and pedv , may use aminopeptidase n ( apn ) as a cellular receptor [ 6 - 10 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	apn is a type ii cell membrane metalloprotease , that is linked to cells by its n - terminal cytoplasmic domain .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	it is highly abundant on the brush border membrane of the mature small intestinal enterocytes , kidney , and liver epithelial cells .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	apn is highly species specific .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	human coronaviruses can not recognize porcine apn as a cellular receptor because of certain differences in glycosylation regions [ 11 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	apn has been identified as a major receptor for tgev , as it has been shown that tgev virions are able to specifically bind to purified apn and conferred the infectivity of tgev to a non - permissive cell line when the cells were expressing recombinant apn [ 7 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	an interaction between apn and pedv infection has also been demonstrated .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	transient expression of apn in mardin - darby canine kidney ( mdck ) cells conferred susceptibility of these cells to pedv infection and the infection was inhibited by anti - apn polyclonal antibodies [ 9 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	cong and colleagues demonstrated that apn mediates pedv infection in vero e6 and in an immortalized porcine enteric cell line [ 12 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	however , increasingly more data demonstrates that apn is not essential for pedv infection , because pedv exhibits no binding to soluble apn [ 13 , 14 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	moreover , vero cells are commonly used for pedv propagation and cultivation in vitro .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	the endogenous expression of apn in vero cells was undetectable in the mrna
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	and the protein levels , which challenges the role of apn as a cellular receptor for pedv .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	therefore , whether apn is a functional receptor for pedv is disputable .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	however , no data are available on the role of apn in primary enterocytes .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	in addition to apn , a sialic acid binding capacity has been reported for tgev and pedv [ 15 , 16 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	sialic acids are electronegatively charged monosaccharides in animals and some microorganisms .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	they are prominently positioned at the outer end of n - glycans , o - glycans , and glycosphingolipids .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	tgev shows a hemagglutinating activity with α-2,3-linked sialic acids on the erythrocyte surface as target .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	among different types of sialic acids , n - glycolylneuraminic acid was recognized by tgev more efficiently than n - acetylneuraminic acid [ 15 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	sialic acid binding by tgev is not essential in the initiation of infection of cultured cells , as tgev mutants lacking sialic acid binding activity can be propagated to the same extent in cultured cells [ 15 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	however , sialic acid binding activity is important for the enteropathogenicity of tgev .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	mutants without sialic acid binding were not capable of initiating intestinal infection in vivo , showing that sialic acid binding is required for efficient intestinal infections [ 17 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	this sialic acid binding activity of tgev is supposed to help the virus to penetrate the mucus layer and to infect intestinal epithelial cells .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	pedv is also able to bind sialic acids .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	pedv s1 protein was reported to bind bovine and porcine mucins that contain a mixture of different types of sugar [ 16 , 18 ] .
1b96d9b48734e5ac426941993ae13390ed2a76d9	furthermore , neu5ac was identified as the most favored binding sugar of pedv s1 by a glycan array screen [ 16 ] .

7a7c1c991ee3905b06ca628a523f693a402cc7f1	larger randomized trials are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of these treatment regimens for mers - cov.
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	we administered an adenoviral vector , onyx-015 , into the hepatic artery of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer involving the liver .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	thirty - five patients enrolled in this multi - institutional phase
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	i / ii trial received up to eight arterial infusions of up to 2 â 10 12 viral particles .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	hepatic toxicity was the primary dose - limiting toxicity observed in preclinical models .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	however , nearly 200 infusions of this adenoviral vector were administered directly into the hepatic artery without significant toxicity .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	therefore , we undertook this analysis to determine the impact of repeated adenoviral exposure on hepatic function .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	seventeen patients were treated at our institution , providing a detailed data set on the changes in hepatic function following repeated exposure to adenovirus .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	no changes in hepatic function occurred with the first treatment of onyx-015 among these patients .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	transient increases in transaminase levels occurred in one patient starting with the second infusion and transient increases in bilirubin was observed in two patients starting with the fifth treatment .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	these changes occurred too early to be explained by viral - mediated lysis of hepatocytes .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	in addition , viremia was observed starting 3 - 5 days after the viral infusion in half of the patient , but was not associated with hepatic toxicity .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	to further understand the basis for the minimal hepatic toxicity of adenoviral vectors , we evaluated the replication of adenovirus in primary hepatocytes and tumor cells in culture and the expression of the coxsackie - adenoviral receptor ( car ) in normal liver and colon cancer metastatic to the liver .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	we found that adenovirus replicates poorly in primary hepatocytes but replicates efficiently in tumors including tumors derived from hepatocytes .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	in addition , we found that car is localized at junctions between hepatocytes and is inaccessible to hepatic blood flow .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	car is not expressed on tumor vasculature but is expressed on tumor cells .
3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68	spatial restriction of car to the intercellular space in normal liver and diminished replication of adenovirus in hepatocytes may explain the minimal toxicity observed following repeated hepatic artery infusions with onyx-015 .

bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	the recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus sars - cov-2 ( also known as 2019-ncov ) threatens global health , given serious cause for concern .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	sars - cov-2 is a human - to - human pathogen that caused fever , severe respiratory disease and pneumonia ( known as covid-19 ) .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	by press time , more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	sars - cov-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	( sars ) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	however , it has increased transmissibility as compared with the sars - cov , e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	it is thus urgent to develop a rapid , accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects , treat them on time and control the disease spreading .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	here we developed an isothermal lamp based method - ilaco ( isothermal lamp based method for covid-19 ) to amplify a fragment of the orf1ab gene using 6 primers .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	we assured the species - specificity of ilaco by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by blast ( including 7 similar coronaviruses , 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses ) .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	the sensitivity is comparable to taqman based qpcr detection method , detecting synthesized rna equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-ncov virus .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	reaction time varied from 15 - 40 minutes , depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples .
bd8f57ea4aadeda075d557f566a1909d68e658c4	the accuracy , simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that ilaco assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-ncov threat control , even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	human respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is the primary cause of bronchopneumonia in infants and children worldwide .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	clinical studies have shown that early treatments of rsv patients with ribavirin improve prognosis , even if the use of this drug is limited due to myelosuppression and toxicity effects .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	furthermore , effective vaccines to prevent rsv infection are currently unavailable .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	thus , the development of highly effective and specific antiviral drugs for pre - exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of rsv infections is a compelling need .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	in the quest of new rsv inhibitors , in this work we evaluated the antiviral activity of a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-1(2)h - benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives in cell - based assays .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	several 1-and 2-phenyl - benzotriazoles resulted fairly potent (
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	µm concentrations ) inhibitors of rsv infection in plaque reduction assays , accompanied by low cytotoxicity in human highly dividing t lymphoid - derived cells and primary cell lines .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	contextually , no inhibitory effects were observed against other rna or dna viruses assayed , suggesting specific activity against rsv .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	further results revealed that the lead compound 10d was active during the early phase of the rsv infection cycle .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	to understand whether 10d interfered with virus attachment to target cells or virus - cell fusion events , inhibitory activity tests against the rsv mutant strain b1 cp-52-expressing
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	only the f envelope glycoprotein - and a plasmid - based reporter assay that quantifies the bioactivity of viral entry were also performed .
48215f45ce10b06c8f96b087cf1d72de2b40662a	the overall biological results , in conjunction with in silico modeling studies , supported the conclusion that the rsv fusion process could be the target of this new series of compounds .

841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	carbapenem - resistant hypervirulent klebsiella pneumoniae strains have recently come into existence worldwide ; however , researchers in northeast china are not aware of their clinical features and molecular characteristics .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	methods :
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	here , the molecular and virulent characteristics of 44 carbapenem - resistant k. pneumoniae ( crkp ) isolates collected from january 2015 to december 2017 were studied .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	multilocus sequence typing ( mlst ) and pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) were carried out to define the clonal relatedness among the isolates .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	pcr and capsular serotyping of the virulence - associated genes , as well as biofilm formation and serum complement - mediated killing assays , were employed to determine the virulent potential .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	the genomic features and associated mobile genetic elements of jmscre57 were detected by whole genome sequencing .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	results :
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	the only positive isolate was jmscre57 , which belonged to the st375 serotype k2 that expressed uge , mrkd , fimh , kpn , aerobactin and rmpa virulence - associated genes and showed strong biofilm formation and serum sensitivity .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	sequencing results showed that the jmscre57 genome mainly consisted of a circular chromosome , three antimicrobial resistant plasmids and a virulent plasmid .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	the antimicrobial resistant plasmid expressing bla kpc-2 , bla ctx - m-15 , aph(3″)-ib , aph(6)-id , qnrb1 , aac(3)-iia , aac(6′)-ib - cr , bla oxa-1 , bla tem-1b , catb4 , sul2 , dfra14 and bla shv-99 .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	the virulent plasmid belonged to the inchi1b group , which is mainly composed of mucoid phenotype genes and siderophore - associated genes .
841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	the remaining crkp strains that expressed uge , fimh , mrkd and kpn virulenceassociated genes were not successfully typed .

841980902bbe37d7053331bd99a96d519dd38ab5	conclusion : our results provide new insights on the epidemiology of carbapenem - resistant k2 hypervirulent k. pneumoniae st375 and crkp st76 strains in northeast china , which may help control their future outbreaks .
12eb0d782c12c3ac096314c26bd9680609970bb9	one of the main problems in quantum information systems is the presence of errors due to noise .
12eb0d782c12c3ac096314c26bd9680609970bb9	many quantum error correcting codes have been designed to deal with generic errors .
12eb0d782c12c3ac096314c26bd9680609970bb9	in this paper we construct new stabilizer codes able to correct a given number eg of generic pauli x , y and z errors , plus a number ez of pauli errors of a specified type ( e.g. , z errors ) .
12eb0d782c12c3ac096314c26bd9680609970bb9	these codes can be of interest when the quantum channel is asymmetric , i.e. , when some types of error occur more frequently than others .
12eb0d782c12c3ac096314c26bd9680609970bb9	for example , we design a [ [ 9 , 1 ] ]
12eb0d782c12c3ac096314c26bd9680609970bb9	quantum error correcting code able to correct up to one generic qubit error plus one z error in arbitrary positions .
12eb0d782c12c3ac096314c26bd9680609970bb9	according to a generalized version of the quantum hamming bound , it is the shortest code with this error correction capability .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	in order to understand the spatio - temporal structure of epidemics beyond that permitted with classical sir ( susceptible - infectiverecovered)-type models , a new mathematical model for the spread of a viral disease in a population of spatially distributed hosts is described .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	the positions of the hosts are randomly generated in a rectangular habitat .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	encounters between any pair of individuals are according to a poisson process with a mean rate that declines exponentially as the distance between them increases .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	the contact rate allows the mean rates to be set at a certain number of encounters per day on average .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	the relevant state variables for each individual at any time are given by the solution of a pair of coupled differential equations for the viral load and the quantity of general immune system effectors which reduce the viral load .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	the parameters describing within - host viral - immune system dynamics are generated randomly to reflect variability across a population .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	transmission is assumed to depend on the viral loads in donors and occurs with a probability p trans .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	the initial conditions are such that one randomly chosen individual carries a randomly chosen amount of the virus , whereas the rest of the population is uninfected .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	simulations reveal local or whole - population responses .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	whole - population disease spread may be in the form of isolated or multiple occurrences , the latter often being approximately periodic .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	the mechanisms of this oscillatory behaviour are analyzed in terms of several parameters and the distribution of critical points in the host dynamical systems .
90a5ee465cb9a3b549a37a8e71d98ac5b064acef	increased contact rate , increased probability of transmission and decreased threshold for viral transmission , decreased immune strength and increased viral growth rate all increase the probability of multiple outbreaks and the distribution of the critical points also plays a role .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	the swine - origin pandemic ( p
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	) h1n1 influenza
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	a virus causes mild upper - respiratory tract disease in most human patients .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	however , some patients developed severe lower - respiratory tract infections with fatal consequences , and the cause of these infections remain unknown .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	recently , it has been suggested that different populations have different degrees of susceptibility to ph1n1 strains due to host genetic variations that are associated with inappropriate immune responses against viral genetic characteristics .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	here , we tested whether the pathologic patterns of influenza strains that produce different disease outcomes in humans could be reproduced in a ferret model .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	our results revealed that the severities of infection did not correspond to particular viral isolate and were not associated with the clinical phenotypes of the corresponding patients .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	severe pathological outcomes were associated with higher viral replication , especially in alveolar areas , and with an exacerbated innate cellular immune response that was characterised by substantial phagocytic and cytotoxic cell migration into the lungs .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	moreover , detrimental innate cellular responses were linked to the up - regulation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the down - regulation of ifnα in the lungs .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	additionally , severe lung lesions were associated with greater up - regulations of pro - apoptotic markers and higher levels of apoptotic neutrophils and macrophages .
8b369168263656b024f65707b9bb501d1b75a56e	in conclusion , this study confirmed that the clinicopathological outcomes of ph1n1 infection in ferrets were not only due to viral replication abilities but also depended on the hosts ' capacities to mount efficient immune responses to control viral infection of the lung .

4cc161090a796945e7bda63489feb4f268bfeb3a	we used a coimmunoprecipitation assay to show that only the ncam was a binding partner of spike protein .
4cc161090a796945e7bda63489feb4f268bfeb3a	we found that a soluble form of anti - ncam antibody blocked association of the phe - cov with n2a cells .

ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	nuclear receptors ( nrs ) are closely associated with various major diseases such as cancer , diabetes , inflammatory disease , and osteoporosis .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	therefore , nrs have become a frequent target for drug development .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	during the process of developing drugs against these diseases by targeting nrs , we are often facing a problem : given a nr and chemical compound , can we identify whether they are really in interaction with each other in a cell ?
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	to address this problem , a predictor called " inr - drug " was developed .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	in the predictor , the drug compound concerned was formulated by a 256-d ( dimensional ) vector derived from its molecular fingerprint , and the nr by a 500-d vector formed by incorporating its sequential evolution information and physicochemical features into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition , and the prediction engine was operated by the svm ( support vector machine )
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	algorithm .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	compared with the existing prediction methods in this area , inr - drug not only can yield a higher success rate , but is also featured by a user - friendly web - server established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/inr-drug/ , which is particularly useful for most experimental scientists to obtain their desired data in a timely manner .
ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329	it is anticipated that the inr - drug server may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development , and that the current approach may be easily extended to study the interactions of drug with other targets as well .

fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	photonic biosensors that use optical resonances to amplify biological signals associated with the adsorption of low - index biological markers offer high - sensitivity detection capability , real - time readout , and scalable lowcost fabrication .
fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	however , they lack inherent target specificity and can be sensitive to temperature variations and other noise sources .
fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	in this letter , we introduce a concept of the high contrast probe cleavage detection ( hcpcd ) mechanism , which makes use of the dramatic optical signal amplification caused by cleavage of large numbers of high - contrast nanoparticle labels instead of the adsorption of low - index biological molecules .
fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	we illustrate numerically the hcpcd detection mechanism with an example of a silicon ring resonator as an optical transducer with gold and silicon nanoparticles as highcontrast labels .
fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	simulations show that it is possible to detect a single cleavage - event by monitoring spectral shifts of micro - ring resonances .
fcb1fbbd47dbeceb09889f5803d521829b27171f	furthermore , detection specificity and signal amplification can be achieved through the use of collateral nucleic acid cleavage caused by enzymes such as cas12a and cas13 after binding to a target dna / rna sequence .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	novel infectious diseases continue to emerge within human populations .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	however , emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence , a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	here , we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human - infective rna virus species .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	we then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits , including human - tohuman transmissibility , transmission routes , tissue tropisms , and host range .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence , we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	the random forest approach predicted literature - assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4 % compared to a null accuracy of 74.2 % .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	in addition to viral taxonomy , the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism , direct contact or respiratory transmission , and limited ( 0 < r 0 � 1 ) human - to - human transmissibility .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	we present a novel , to our knowledge , comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human rna virus species .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	the risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms .
572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367	these risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections .
87dc0d35c4813a03c19333d1325088382f0dc536	multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by leukocyte infiltration and subsequent axonal damage , demyelinating inflammation , and formation of sclerosing plaques in brain tissue .
87dc0d35c4813a03c19333d1325088382f0dc536	the results of various studies in patients indicate that autoimmunity and inflammation make an important impact on the pathogenesis of ms .
87dc0d35c4813a03c19333d1325088382f0dc536	chemokines are key mediators of inflammation development and cell migration , mediating various immune cell responses , including chemotaxis and immune activation , and are important in immunity and inflammation , therefore we focus on chemokines and their receptors in multiple sclerosis .
87dc0d35c4813a03c19333d1325088382f0dc536	in this article , we summarize the study of the role of prominent chemokines and their receptors in ms patients and ms animal modelsand discuss their potential significance in inflammatory injury and repair of ms .
87dc0d35c4813a03c19333d1325088382f0dc536	we have also summarized the progress in the treatment of multiple sclerosis antagonists in recent years with chemokine receptors as targets .
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	we analysed the expression of clinically important pro - inflammatory and immune - modulatory cytokines .
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	iav infection or treatment with supernatants from iav - infected cell cultures resulted in priming of the dcs which subsequently influenced the production of il-12p70 , as well as il-6 , following sp infection .
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	co - infection of the same cell was not required but this effect was dependent on the time , dose and duration of the infections , as well as pathogen viability , bacterial uptake and endosome acidification .
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	bacterially infected cells were characterized as the main producers of il-12p70 .
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	finally , we showed that type i interferons were primarily responsible for the priming of il-12p70 that was observed by infection with iav .
80013c44d7d2d3949096511ad6fa424a2c740813	these results provide a probable mechanism for the elevated levels of particular cytokines observed in iav and sp co - infected cell cultures with implications for the pathogenic outcome observed during in vivo infection .

cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	although a previous report described detection of viral rna in donor plasma , these donors tested positive for sars - cov-2 in a respiratory specimen or developed fever shortly after donation , suggesting that the donation occurred early in the course of their infection ( 2 ) .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	to our knowledge , the persistence of sars - cov-2 rna in plasma from an eligible donor after recovery from illness has not yet been described .

cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	positive pools were resolved by retesting the individual samples they comprised .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	this testing algorithm is in line with current u.s. food and drug administration - approved nucleic acid tests used to screen for infectious diseases in blood donors , which also use mini - pool testing .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	the index donation was collected on 23 april 2020 after approximately 700 negative donations .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	the cycle threshold value ( ct ) for the positive mini - pool sample was 40.9 , and the subsequent individual sample was positive at a ct of 42.1-both results at the limit of detection for the assay .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	we further confirmed sars - cov-2 rna detection by rt - pcr targeting the nucleocapsid gene ( n2 region : ct , 37.8 )
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	( 4 ) from a separate sample drawn from the donor on the day of donation , thereby making cross - contamination highly unlikely .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	negative plasma controls were included on each run , and sars - cov-2 rna was not detected .

cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	given these equivocal and negative findings , neutralization assays were not performed .
cb24bbd516f1653465607baa53bd7c18599c811b	the donor had symptoms of upper respiratory infection in early march , including body aches and sore throat without fever .

543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	sars - coronavirus ( cov ) is a zoonotic agent derived from rhinolophid bats , in which a plethora of sars - related , conspecific viral lineages exist .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	whereas the variability of virulence among reservoir - borne viruses is unknown , it is generally assumed that the emergence of epidemic viruses from animal reservoirs requires human adaptation .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	to understand the influence of a viral factor in relation to interspecies spillover , we studied the papain - like protease ( plp ) of sars -
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	cov.
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	this key enzyme drives the early stages of infection as it cleaves the viral polyprotein , deubiquitinates viral and cellular proteins , and antagonizes the interferon ( ifn ) response .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	we identified a bat sars - cov plp , which shared 86 % amino acid identity with sars - cov plp , and used reverse genetics to insert it into the sars - cov genome .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	the resulting virus replicated like sars - cov in vero cells but was suppressed in ifn competent ma-104 ( 3.7-fold ) , calu-3 ( 2.6-fold ) and human airway epithelial cells ( 10.3fold ) .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	using ectopically - expressed plp variants as well as full sars - cov infectious clones chimerized for plp , we found that a protease - independent , anti - ifn function exists in sars - cov , but not in a sars - related , bat - borne virus .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	this plp - mediated anti - ifn difference was seen in primate , human as well as bat cells , thus independent of the host context .
543bb5a781a4069b7239c71dc88ccdadebd085bf	the results of this study revealed that coronavirus plp confers a variable virulence trait among members of the species sars - cov , and that a sars - cov lineage with virulent plps may have pre - existed in the reservoir before onset of the epidemic .

f31038fde5984b92a3b4bb4be0f763e9041ba557	a case - control study was carried out to compare the carriage of some common canine enteric pathogens ( enteric coronavirus , parvovirus , distemper , endoparasites , campylobacter and salmonella spp . ) , as well as lifestyle factors such as vaccination history , diet and contact with other species , in dogs presenting at first opinion veterinary practices with and without diarrhoea .
f31038fde5984b92a3b4bb4be0f763e9041ba557	multivariable conditional logistic regression showed that dogs in the study which scavenged or had had a recent change of diet ( or 3.5 , p = 0.002 ) , had recently stayed in kennels ( or 9.5 , p = 0.01 ) , or were fed a home - cooked diet ( or 4 , p = 0.002 )

601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	epstein - barr virus ( ebv)-induced posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease ( ptld ) continues to be a major complication following stem cell transplantation and is associated with high mortality .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	the aim of the study was to evaluate ebv viral load as a parameter to identify patients at risk for developing ptld .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	methods :
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	68 samples of 9 patient with ptld after allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( sct ) were analyzed by quantitative competitive pcr and compared with 349 samples from 50 patients ( 22 children , 28 adults ) without ptld after sct .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	results :
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	all patients negative in ebv - dna showed no sings of ptld ( 266 samples ) .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	patients with ptld differed from patients without in ebv viral load .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	median viral load at diagnosis of ptld was 1 400 000 copies / microg dna compared to 40 000 copies / microg dna in 83 samples of patients without ptld ( p ͻ0,0001 ) .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	a cut off level of 100 000 ebv copies / microg dna showed the best diagnostic efficacy with a sensitivity of 87 % and a specificity of 91 % .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	ptld occurred between day 40 - 170 after transplantation .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	median time when ebv dna was detectable prior to clinical onset of ptld was 36 days
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	( range 20 - 71 d ) .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	patients developing ptld did not differ from patients without ptld in the time interval when the ebv viral load increased first after transplantation .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	ebv primary infections occurred earlier after transplantation than reactivations in patients without ptld .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	peak levels did not differ between primary infections and reactivations .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	conclusion
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	: ebv viral load is an important diagnostic tool in identifying patients at risk for ptld .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	ebv reactivations or primary infections occur in a number of cases between 2 weeks and 3 month after transplantation but result only in few cases in ptld .

601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	human herpesvirus 6 ( hhv-6 ) , a member of the beta - herpesvirinae subfamily , is highly seroprevalent and has a world wide distribution .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	two variant groups a and b are recognised .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	after primary infection hhv-6 persists lifelong in latency and can be reactivated in conditions of immunosuppression .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	it has been reported to be associated with myelosuppression after bone marrow transplantation .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	to elucidate the role of hhv-6 in hematopoiesis we investigated the influence of the two variants hhv-6a and b on in vitro expansion and differentiation of cord blood ( cb ) progenitor cells .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	macs enriched cb - cd34 + cells were initially incubated with one of the hhv-6 variants and subsequently cultured for 14 days in the presence of cytokines supporting a maximal expansion of mononuclear cells .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	infection was evaluated by immunofluorescence and real - time pcr .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	we found significant reduction of the expansion rate ( pͻ.001 ) in cultures infected with hhv-6a compared to control cultures after 14 days .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	in contrast , hhv-6b did not exhibit a significant suppression .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	inhibition affected all blood cell differentiation lines similarly as determined by flow cytometry for cd34 , cd33 , cd14 , cxcr4 in hhv-6a , hhv-6b infected and in control cultures .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	using quantitative pcr , we monitored the hhv-6 dna load during cell culture .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	the correlation of cell expansion and the degree of infection ( i.e. hhv-6 dna load ) revealed , that even high numbers of hhv-6b genome equivalents present in the culture had little suppressive effect on the total cell expansion .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	in contrast , hhv-6a had a strong suppressive effect .
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	we were able to detect hhv-6 antigen in hhv-6a and b
601cb64b9d13a82ec6cc19aa3aea69b2a0935c6d	infected cultures but could not detect hhv-6 in immature cd34 + cells .

9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	although the polymerase chain reaction is the most commonly used , there are several other methods available , which have applicability across the range of microbial pathogens .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	this review does not intend to be a comprehensive treatise on the rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	there are several excellent textbooks that cover the field in detail 1,2 .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	it will , instead , focus on recent and future trends .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	laboratory diagnosis is essential in the overwhelming majority of clinical conditions that require specific therapy .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	it is a misconception , for example , that streptococcal pharyngitis can be reliably differentiated on clinical grounds from viral pharyngitis in an individual patient .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	probability estimates can be made ( for instance common cold symptoms have an 80 % negative predictive value for the diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis ) , but confirmation is only after laboratory examination .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	most diagnostic advances in the last decade have focused on detection technologies .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	it should not be forgotten , however , that sampling inadequacies are the prime reason for failure to identify aetiology .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	it is well recognised that , for most respiratory viruses , the delay in transport of the specimen to the laboratory is usually the major factor in both slowness of the process and a failure to make a diagnosis .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	there has been some success in applying near - patient testing .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	this has , in general , made the diagnosis of respiratory tract virus infection more reliable and speedier .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	it has had particular use in differentiating respiratory syncytial virus cases who might need admission from other causes of viral respiratory tract infection .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	another important consideration is the type of specimen used .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	for lower respiratory tract bacterial infections , sputum is the gold standard specimen , but the quality of the specimen is key because oral and gastrointestinal secretions may contaminate it .
9f8aaa1f759bcf746c56fd5e4d51f1b0ce443e51	ideally , there should be fewer than 10 squamous cells and greater than 25 leukocytes in a low power ( x100

33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	as of april 4 , 2020 , it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide .
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	the main focus of this paper is two - fold : ( a ) generating short term
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	( real - time ) forecasts of the future covid-19 cases for multiple countries ; ( b ) risk assessment ( in terms of case fatality rate ) of the novel covid-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics .
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	to solve the first problem , we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and wavelet - based forecasting model that can generate short - term ( ten days ahead )
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for canada , france , india , south korea , and the uk .
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	the predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early - warning system for government policymakers .
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	in the second problem , we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries .
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	this data - driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries .
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	motivated by the above discussion , we propose a novel hybrid arima - wbf model which is a two - step pipeline approach .
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	in the first step of the proposed hybrid approach , an arima model is built to model the linear components of the epidemic time series , and a set of outof - sample forecasts are generated .
33d122f099d6f6ab03b9ac2d756910607451fca7	in the second phase , the arima residuals ( oscillatory residual series ) are remodeled using a mathematically - grounded wbf model .

013d9d1cba8a54d5d3718c229b812d7cf91b6c89	a novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) emerged in wuhan city , china , at the end of 2019 and has caused an outbreak of human - to - human
7f796fc1f34c8e45bc773c7f0f7f982b750f7957	the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) is an important issue for treatment and prevention of sars .
7f796fc1f34c8e45bc773c7f0f7f982b750f7957	recently , sars - cov 3cl pro protease has been implied to be possible relevance to sars - cov pathogenesis .
7f796fc1f34c8e45bc773c7f0f7f982b750f7957	in this study , we intended to identify potential 3cl pro -interacting cellular protein(s ) using the phage - displayed human lung cdna library .

7f796fc1f34c8e45bc773c7f0f7f982b750f7957	in addition , our result also demonstrated the cleavage of the v - atpase g1 fusion protein and the immunoprecipitation of cellular v - atpase g1 by the 3cl pro .
7f796fc1f34c8e45bc773c7f0f7f982b750f7957	moreover , loading cells with snarf-1 ph - sensitive dye showed that the intracellular ph in 3cl pro -expressing cells was significantly lower as compared to mock cells .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	background :
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) and feline enteric coronavirus ( fecv ) are two important coronaviruses of domestic cat worldwide .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	although fcov is prevalent among cats ; the fastidious nature of type i fcov to grow on cell culture has limited further studies on tissue tropism and pathogenesis of fcov.
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	while several studies reported serological evidence for fcov in malaysia , neither the circulating fcov isolated nor its biotypes determined .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	this study for the first time , describes the isolation and biotypes determination of type i and type ii fcov from naturally infected cats in malaysia .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	findings :
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	of the total number of cats sampled , 95 % ( 40/42 ) were rt - pcr positive for fcov. inoculation of clinical samples into crandell feline kidney cells ( crfk ) , and feline catus whole fetus-4 cells ( fcwf-4 ) , show cytopathic effect ( cpe ) characterized by syncytial cells formation and later cell detachment .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	differentiation of fcov biotypes using rt - pcr assay revealed that , 97.5 % and 2.5 % of local isolates were type i and type ii fcov , respectively .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	these isolates had high sequence homology and phylogenetic similarity with several fcov isolates from europe , south east asia and usa .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	conclusions :
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	this study reported the successful isolation of local type i and type ii fcov evident with formation of cytopathic effects in two types of cell cultures namely the crfk and fcwf-4 , where the later cells being more permissive .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	however , the rt - pcr assay is more sensitive in detecting the antigen in suspected samples as compared to virus isolation in cell culture .
1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208	the present study indicated that type i fcov is more prevalent among cats in malaysia .

a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	records of patients diagnosed with sars - cov-2 pneumonia were reviewed retrospectively from 24 january 2020 to 15 march 2020 .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	patients were classified into common and severe groups according to the diagnostic criteria of severe pneumonia .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	the quantitative ct features of lung lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms , and the percentages of ground - glass opacity volume ( pgv ) , consolidation volume ( pcv ) and total lesion volume ( ptv ) were determined in both lungs .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	pgv , pcv and ptv were analyzed based on the time from the onset of initial symptoms in the common and severe groups .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	in the common group , ptv increased slowly and peaked at approximately 12 days from the onset of the initial symptoms .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	in the severe group , ptv peaked at approximately 17 days .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	the severe pneumonia group exhibited increased pgv , pcv and ptv compared with the common group .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	these features started to appear in stage 2 ( 4 - 7 days from onset of initial symptoms ) and were observed in all subsequent stages ( p<0.05 ) .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	in severe sars - cov-2 pneumonia patients , pgv , pcv and ptv began to significantly increase in stage 2 and decrease in stage 5 ( 22 - 30 days ) .
a45bcf3fdf693fe5993fa796a012071f985699fe	compared with common sars - cov-2 pneumonia patients , the patients in the severe group exhibited increased pgv , pcv and ptv as well as a later peak time of lesion and recovery time .

bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	between 28 - 30 april 2020 , a retrospective cohort study was conducted among pupils , their parents and relatives , and staff of primary schools exposed to sars - cov-2 in february and march 2020 in a city north of paris , france .
bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	participants completed a questionnaire that covered sociodemographic information and history of recent symptoms .
bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	a blood sample was tested for the presence of anti - sars - cov-2 antibodies using a flow - cytometry - based assay .
bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	the infection attack rate ( iar ) was 45/510 ( 8.8 % ) , 3/42 ( 7.1 % ) , 1/28 ( 3.6 % ) , 76/641 ( 11.9 % ) and 14/119 ( 11.8 % ) among primary school pupils , teachers , non - teaching staff , parents , and relatives , respectively ( p = 0.29 ) .
bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	prior to school closure on february 14 , three sars - cov-2 infected pupils attended three separate schools with no secondary cases in the following 14 days among pupils , teachers and non - teaching staff of the same schools .
bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	familial clustering of cases was documented by the high proportion of antibodies among parents and relatives of infected pupils ( 36/59 = 61.0 % and 4/9 = 44.4 % , respectively ) .
bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	in children , disease manifestations were mild , and 24/58 ( 41.4 % ) of infected children were asymptomatic .
bb3732b61eff2ca424405eebe277a872c5b70d82	in young children , sars - cov-2 infection was largely mild or asymptomatic and there was no evidence of onwards transmission from children in the school setting .

64401a16bbe3a6f8248d666e33a851463424c5af	waarop zorgorganisaties hiermee omgaan .
64401a16bbe3a6f8248d666e33a851463424c5af	op de eerste plaats proberen zorgorganisaties met man en macht hun personeel inzetbaar te houden .
64401a16bbe3a6f8248d666e33a851463424c5af	daarnaast worden er verschillende digitale oplossingen geïmplementeerd en wordt er op ongekende schaal en snelheid samengewerkt met organisaties binnen en buiten de zorg .
64401a16bbe3a6f8248d666e33a851463424c5af	dit gebeurt in directe interactie met landelijk en regionaal beleid , dat als last of lust ervaren wordt .
64401a16bbe3a6f8248d666e33a851463424c5af	om goed door de coronacrisis te komen en de zorg op een duurzame manier te organiseren in het ' nieuwe normaal ' na de crisis , is

64401a16bbe3a6f8248d666e33a851463424c5af	the covid-19 pandemic presents healthcare organizations with substantial challenges .
64401a16bbe3a6f8248d666e33a851463424c5af	four main themes can be distinguished in the way healthcare organizations organize the necessary preconditions for their professionals to provide high quality care in this crisis .

64401a16bbe3a6f8248d666e33a851463424c5af	it is essential to learn from these approaches and rapidly disseminate the associated best practices .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	the purpose of this study is to explore whether the diffusion of cryptocurrencies represents a disruptive change and what is the potential magnitude of this change .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	to this end , we take disruptive innovation theory as our point of departure to scrutinize cryptocurrencies as an instance of sociotechnical change .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	we employ causal layered analysis to develop our four - layer analytical framework to conceptually examine the changes pertained by the diffusion of cryptocurrencies .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	we provide examples of changes company - level , industry - level as well as societal changes where cryptocurrencies have played a central role .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	on a company level , cryptocurrencies provide a cost - efficient means for cross - border money transfer and thus pose a significant threat to the existing intermediary - based business models .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	on an industry level , many central banks are experimenting with crypto - or digital currencies .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	on a societal level , cryptocurrencies play an important role in particularly when the traditional institutions and societal structures collapse .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	for example , in venezuela 's recent political and economic crisis , cryptocurrencies contributed to the development of a parallel financial system when the bolivar practically lost its value .
396e0db0b18179ffad194218f4e9dc08e6477927	our study provides an analytical framework to systematically evaluate the potential disruptive nature of cryptocurrencies as well as other blockchain - based technologies .

4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	live - virus vaccines activate both humoral and cell - mediated immunity , require only a single boosting , and generally provide longer immune protection than killed or subunit vaccines .
4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	however , growth of live - virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects , and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serialtransfer viral adaptation are not well - understood .
4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	new methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth .
4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	to begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype , we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) , a well - studied , nonsegmented , negative - stranded rna virus .
4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of vsv while integrating key wild - type infection steps :
4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	hijacking of host resources , transcription , translation , and replication , followed by assembly and release of progeny vsv particles .
4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	generalization of the wild - type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant vsv strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene .
4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64	finally , our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other vsv genes has the potential to attenuate the vsv growth while overexpressing the immunogenic vsv surface glycoprotein .

1c8afcb822dac8e8e5b33a85c2c2e9c7cc24a25a	the maryland 27(md27 ) strain was first isolated in 1976 from diseased chicken flocks in the delmarva peninsula region .
1c8afcb822dac8e8e5b33a85c2c2e9c7cc24a25a	to understand the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship of existing strains with md27 , the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3'end coding region ( ~7.2 kb ) of md27 was determined and compared with other ibv strains and coronaviruses .
1c8afcb822dac8e8e5b33a85c2c2e9c7cc24a25a	it has the same s-3-m-5-n-3 ' gene order , as is the case of other ibv strains .
1c8afcb822dac8e8e5b33a85c2c2e9c7cc24a25a	the spike gene of md27 exhibits 97 % identity with the se17 strain .
1c8afcb822dac8e8e5b33a85c2c2e9c7cc24a25a	there are deletions at the spike gene , non - coding region between m and 5 genes , and at the 3'untranslated region ( utr ) , which is different from ark - like strains .
1c8afcb822dac8e8e5b33a85c2c2e9c7cc24a25a	phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments demonstrate that md27 is a chimera containing different gene segments that are most closely related to the se17 , conn and jmk strains .
1c8afcb822dac8e8e5b33a85c2c2e9c7cc24a25a	this current study provides evidence for genomic mutations and intergenic recombination that have taken place in the evolution of ibv strain md27 .

107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198	for example , medium consumption should be low to obtain a very high concentration of viable host cells in an economical way but must be balanced against the requirement that accumulation of toxic metabolites and limitation of nutrients have to be avoided .
107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198	hcd cultivations should also be optimized to avoid unwanted induction of apoptosis or autophagy during the early phase of virus infection .
107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198	to realize the full potential of hcd cultivations , a rational analysis of the cultivation conditions of the appropriate host cell line together with the optimal infection conditions for the chosen viral vaccine strain needs to be performed for each particular manufacturing process .

107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198	at this cell concentration , a medium exchange at time of infection was required to obtain expected virus yields during the first 24 h after infection .
107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198	applying an additional fed - batch feeding strategy during the whole virus replication phase resulted in a faster virus titer increase during the first 36 h after infection .
107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198	in contrast , a semicontinuous virus harvest scheme improved virus accumulation and recovery at a rather later stage of infection .
107473b0cd4ea537c8b91fd611460b3a3a217198	overall , a combination of both fed - batch and medium exchange strategies resulted in similar cell - specific virus yields as those obtained for ccd processes but 10-fold higher mva - cr19 titers , and four times higher volumetric productivity .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	the cytokine family of interferons ( ifns ) has multiple functions , including antiviral , antitumor , and immunomodulatory effects and regulation of cell differentiation .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	the multiple functions of the ifn system are thought to be an innate defense against microbes and foreign substances .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	the ifn system consists first of cells that produce ifns in response to viral infection or other foreign stimuli and second of cells that establish the antiviral state in response to ifns .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	this process of innate immunity involves multiple signaling mechanisms and activation of various host genes .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	viruses have evolved to develop mechanisms that circumvent this system .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	ifns have also been used clinically in the treatment of viral diseases .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	improved treatments will be possible with better understanding of the ifn system and its interactions with viral factors .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	in addition , ifns have direct and indirect effects on tumor cell proliferation , effector leukocytes and on apoptosis and have been used in the treatment of some cancers .
a543df2c64d32d631f44801e7fdb09ead2b96518	improved knowledge of how ifns affect tumors and the mechanisms that lead to a lack of response to ifns would help the development of better ifn treatments for malignancies .

1142bd436ce67b7a76a4edb1a555fee6b179b546	the availability of genomic data is key to understanding viral evolution and dynamics , supporting improved control strategies .
1142bd436ce67b7a76a4edb1a555fee6b179b546	currently , the use of highthroughput sequencing ( hts ) technologies , which can be applied both directly to patient samples ( shotgun metagenomics ) and to pcr - amplified viral sequences ( amplicon sequencing ) , is potentially the most informative approach to monitor viral dissemination and genetic diversity by providing , in a single methodological step , identification and characterization of the whole viral genome at the nucleotide level .
1142bd436ce67b7a76a4edb1a555fee6b179b546	despite many advantages , these technologies require bioinformatics expertise and appropriate infrastructure for the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data .

e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	this study investigated abomasal luminal parameters in healthy and diarrheic calves by using a wireless ambulatory capsule ( wac ) .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	the acetaminophen absorption test ( apat ) was used to determine abomasal emptying rate .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	four healthy and five diarrheic female holstein - friesian calves ( age < 14 days ) were included in the study .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	for apat , calves were fed 2 l of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen / kg body weight , and blood samples were taken during a 12-h period afterward .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	concomitantly , a wac in the abomasum continuously measured luminal ph , pressure , and temperature .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	five hours post suckling , intraluminal temperature was significantly higher in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	abomasal ph and pressure were not significantly different , but intraluminal pressure was always numerically lower in diarrheic calves .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	during apat no significant differences in maximum acetaminophen concentrations ( c max ) and time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration ( t max ) were observed .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	nonlinear regression findings revealed a longer acetaminophen half - time ( aap t 1/2 ) in diarrheic calves compared to healthy calves [ 564 ± 96 min vs. 393 ±

e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	significant differences in apat reflected a delay in abomasal emptying in diarrheic calves .
e7eb528f769dd79cfaa7fb5ea4503301f1b9f526	impaired abomasal movement may induce enhanced bacterial fermentation processes as indicated by a higher abomasal temperature in diarrheic calves , which should be considered in management of their feeding .
53418502dd5cdd7ae9e551ecd15398af5613b5b6	feline immunodeficiency virus ( fiv ) causes aids in the domestic cat ( felis catus ) but has not been explicitly associated with aids pathology in any of the eight free - ranging species of felidae that are endemic with circulating fiv strains .

6970df5eee622e854847bddc7fbb313c098b9f37	avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus ( ibv ) is a major poultry pathogen .
6970df5eee622e854847bddc7fbb313c098b9f37	a characteristic feature of ibv is the occurrence of many different strains belonging to different serotypes , which renders complete control of the disease by vaccination a challenging task due to the poor cross - protection between different serotypes .
6970df5eee622e854847bddc7fbb313c098b9f37	in this study , based on the results of s1 sequence analysis and virus crossneutralization tests , ibv strain ck / ch / lgx/111119 was found to be genetically and antigenically different from other known ibv types , representing not only a novel genotype , but also a novel serotype ( designated as gi-28 ) .
6970df5eee622e854847bddc7fbb313c098b9f37	viruses belonging to this novel serotype have been isolated from several regions in china in recent years , suggesting endemic circulation of the serotype in various geographic locations in china .
6970df5eee622e854847bddc7fbb313c098b9f37	further studies by complete genomic analysis showed that strain ck / ch / lgx/111119 may have originated from recombination events involving lx4 genotype ibvs and an as - yet - unidentified ibv donating a s1 gene , or from the result of accumulation of mutations and selections , especially in the s1 gene , from a lx4 genotype virus .
6970df5eee622e854847bddc7fbb313c098b9f37	ck / ch / lgx/111119 is a nephropathogenic strain ,

1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	covid-19 pandemic has spread all over the world for months .
1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	as its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people 's lives , the accurate and fast detection of the covid-19 infection is crucial .
1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	although many recent studies have shown that deep learning based solutions can help detect covid-19 based on chest ct scans , there lacks a consistent and systematic comparison and evaluation on these techniques .
1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	in this paper , we first build a clean and segmented ct dataset called clean - cc - ccii by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large ct scan dataset cc - ccii with three classes : novel coronavirus pneumonia ( ncp ) , common pneumonia ( cp ) , and normal controls ( normal ) .

1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state - of - the - art ( sota ) 3d and 2d convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) .
1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	the results show that 3d cnns outperform 2d cnns in general .
1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	with extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning , we find that the 3d cnn model densenet3d121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63 % ( f1score is 88.14 % and auc is 0.940 ) , and another 3d cnn model resnet3d34 achieves the best auc of 0.959

1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	we further demonstrate that the mixup data augmentation technique can largely improve the model performance .
1ca354d24da3f91d6932a4558d946884a96929b5	at last , we design an automated deep learning methodology to generate a lightweight deep learning model mnas3dnet41 that achieves an accuracy of 87.14 % , f1-score of 87.25 % , and auc of 0.957 , which are on par with the best models made by ai experts .

af85d62dad56c342735a9de492e94b1764a4fbcb	background :
af85d62dad56c342735a9de492e94b1764a4fbcb	patient selection and cannulation arguably represent the key steps for the successful implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) support .
af85d62dad56c342735a9de492e94b1764a4fbcb	cannulation is traditionally performed in the operating room or the catheterization laboratory for a number of reasons , including physician preference and access to real - time imaging , with the goal of minimizing complications and ensuring appropriate cannula positioning .
af85d62dad56c342735a9de492e94b1764a4fbcb	nonetheless , the patients ' critical and unstable conditions often require emergent initiation of ecmo and preclude the safe transport of the patient to a procedural suite .
af85d62dad56c342735a9de492e94b1764a4fbcb	aims :
af85d62dad56c342735a9de492e94b1764a4fbcb	therefore , with the objective of avoiding delay with the initiation of therapy and reducing the hazard of transport , we implemented a protocol for bedside ecmo cannulation .

ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	los angeles has become an epicenter of the sars - cov-2 pandemic in the us .
ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	efforts to contain the spread of sars - cov-2 require identifying its genetic and geographic variation and understanding the drivers of these differences .
ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	for the first time , we report genetic characterization of sars - cov-2 genome isolates in the los angeles population using targeted next generation sequencing ( ngs ) .
ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	samples collected at cedars sinai medical center were collected from patients with confirmed sars - cov-2 infection .
ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	we identified and diagnosed 192 patients by our in - house qpcr assay .
ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	in this population , the highest frequency variants were in known mutations in the 5'utr , aa193 protein , rdrp and the spike glycoprotein .
ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	sars - cov-2 transmission within the local community was tracked by integrating mutation data with patient postal codes with two predominant community spread clusters being identified .

ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	less than 10 % of the los angeles community samples resembled published mutational profiles of sars - cov-2 genomes from china , while > 50 % of the isolates shared closely similarities to those from new york state .
ad642086a6abcb842037d7dff1cfb54931388003	based on these findings we conclude sars - cov-2 was likely introduced into the los angeles community predominantly from new york state but also via multiple other independent transmission routes including but not limited to washington state and china .

e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	we evaluated farmworkers exposed to pesticides and individuals with no history of occupational exposure to pesticides .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	it was performed the comet assay to evaluate dna damage .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	the immunophenotyping of tcd4 + lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood was performed by flow cytometry .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	the single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in pon1 , xrcc1 , il6 , il6r , tnf - α , and mir137 genes were evaluated by real - time pcr .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	the exposed group was composed mostly by males ( 69.44 % ) , with direct exposure to pesticides ( 56 % ) and with an average age range of 46 ± 13.89 years , being that 58.3 % of farmworkers directly exposed to pesticides and reported the full use of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	dna damage was greater in the exposed group ( p < 0.05 ) , reinforced by the use of ppe to denote a lower degree of dna damage ( p = 0.002 ) .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	in this context , in the exposed group , we demonstrated that the use of ppe , age , gender and intoxication events were the variables that most contributed to increase dna damage ( p < 0.0001 ) .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	besides , the exposed group showed a significant increase in the subpopulations of t lymphocytes cd3
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	+ cd4 + ( p = 0.04 )
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	and cd3 + cd4 + cd25 + ( p < 0.0001 ) .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	snps in the tnf - α ( rs361525 ) gene presented a difference in the genotype distribution between the groups ( p = 0.002 ) .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	the genotype distribution of tnf - α ( rs361525 ) was also positively correlated with the dna damage of the exposed group ( r = 0.19 ; p = 0.01 ) , demonstrating a higher risk of dna damage in the farmworkers presenting the a mutated allele .
e8189566bea3deb42454610e32e39c843297bf34	our findings demonstrate that pesticides can exert various deleterious effects on human health by damaging the dna as well as by influencing the immune system in the case of both direct or indirect exposure and these issues are associated to age , gender , intoxication and the nonuse of ppe .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	bovine torovirus ( btov ) , a member of the coronaviridae family , is an established gastrointestinal infectious agent in cattle .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	no epidemiological research on btov has been reported from japan .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	in this study , we performed a survey to detect btov in japan in 2004 and 2005 using 231 fecal samples ( 167 from diarrheic cattle and 64 from asymptomatic cattle ) that were analyzed by nested reverse transcription
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	( rt ) pcr using primers located in the consensus sequences of the reported btov nucleocapsid ( n ) , membrane ( m ) , and spike ( s ) genes .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	btov n , m , and s genes were detected in 6.5 % ( 15/231 ) , 6.1 % ( 14/231 ) , and 5.6 % ( 13/231 ) of samples by nested - rt - pcr , respectively .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	in conclusion , detectability was improved compared to the results of the first round of rt - pcr .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	btov was detected at a significantly higher rate in diarrheic samples than in asymptomatic samples ( 14/167 diarrheic samples [ 8.4 % ] and 1/64 asymptomatic samples [ 1.6 % ] ) , suggesting that btov may act as a risk factor for diarrhea in japanese cattle .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	the nucleotide sequence of m fragments from the btov isolates including the newly identified japanese isolates showed more than 97 % identity .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	a similar degree of homology was observed in the n gene fragment among btov isolates with the exception of brv-1 and brv-2 .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	domestic samples were classified into three clusters by phylogenetic analysis of the s gene fragment , which were considerably correlated with the geographic origin of the samples .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	btov positive areas did not adjoin each other but were spread across a wide range , suggesting that btov exists conventionally in japan and is geographically differentiated .
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	we also developed an rflp method to distinguish these clusters using two restriction enzymes , haeiii and acci.
5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d	this method should be useful for comparing newly acquired btov - positive samples with the reported btovs .
0ae71868fc7f1f6ffe401154c10b985f4e443b15	the article aims to introduce four types of integral transforms for functions whose function values belong to a complete residuated lattice .
0ae71868fc7f1f6ffe401154c10b985f4e443b15	the integral transforms are defined using so - called qualitative residuum based fuzzy integrals and integral kernels in the form of binary fuzzy relations .
0ae71868fc7f1f6ffe401154c10b985f4e443b15	we present some of the basic properties of proposed integral transforms including a linearity property that is satisfied under specific conditions for comonotonic functions .

871ebc4ba030dbc666e9520d28b5f64e7a0ebf17	here we review recent data indicating
871ebc4ba030dbc666e9520d28b5f64e7a0ebf17	that coronaviruses probably co - opt membranous carriers derived from the endoplasmic reticulum , which contain proteins that regulate disposal of misfolded polypeptides , for their replication .
871ebc4ba030dbc666e9520d28b5f64e7a0ebf17	in addition , we also present models describing potential mechanisms that coronaviruses could employ for this hijacking .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	background an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in wuhan city , hubei province , china .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	no data on person - to - person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	in this study , we report the epidemiological , clinical , laboratory , radiological , and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to shenzhen , guangdong province , china , after a visit to wuhan , and an additional family member who did not travel to wuhan .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	findings from jan 10 , 2020 , we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to wuhan from shenzhen between dec 29 , 2019 and jan 4 , 2020 .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	of six family members who travelled to wuhan , five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	additionally , one family member , who did not travel to wuhan , became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	none of the family members had contacts with wuhan markets or animals , although two had visited a wuhan hospital .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	five family members ( aged 36 - 66 years ) presented with fever , upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms , or diarrhoea , or a combination of these 3 - 6 days after exposure .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	they presented to our hospital ( the university of hong kong - shenzhen hospital , shenzhen ) 6 - 10 days after symptom onset .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	they and one asymptomatic child ( aged 10 years ) had radiological ground - glass lung opacities .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	older patients ( aged > 60 years ) had more systemic symptoms , extensive radiological ground - glass lung changes , lymphopenia , thrombocytopenia , and increased c - reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	the nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point - of - care multiplex rt - pcr , but five patients ( four adults and the child ) were rt - pcr positive for genes encoding the internal rna - dependent rna polymerase and surface spike protein of this novel coronavirus , which were confirmed by sanger sequencing .
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	phylogenetic analysis of these five patients ' rt - pcr amplicons and two full genomes by nextgeneration sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus , which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (

4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	interpretation
4ec6767243752fcbf802e99842e4761c91c64dc5	our findings are consistent with person - to - person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings , and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	the solidarity and discovery trials were launched to facilitate the rapid worldwide comparison of the efficacy and safety of treatments against covid-19 .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	this study aimed to review the trial designs of solidarity and discovery and their feasibility to generate high - quality evidence .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	the discovery trial design was detailed consistently in both the european and the us clinical rial registries .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	solidarity was registered on ictrp , with country - specific information reported on country - level registry platforms .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	the discovery trial 's design appears to be ideal from the methodological perspective .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	both trials appear difficult to implement , impractical , and disconnected from the pandemic reality .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	this is consistent with the apparent failure of the trials to deliver conclusions before the end of the pandemic .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	both trials constitute an interesting initiative yet may lack the resources to support a highquality implementation .
16bfc343de074c59680def88928ec66db403bb63	the authors call for a pandemic task force , with various experts on the front - line of covid-19 , to inform policy - makers to make effective decisions that may not be based on traditional , methodological state - of - the - art evidence , but rather pragmatic and revisable decisions reflecting emerging evidence for the benefit of patients and society .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	keywords the emergence and consequent impact of covid-19 has led to clinicians and academics looking for evidence , with clinical controversies to parallel socio - economical and political ones .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	a key clinical controversy has been whether the use of angiotensinconverting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ( arbs ) might be detrimental or beneficial in covid-19 .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	this is a widely prescribed class of drugs with a strong evidence base in hypertension and cardiovascular risk reduction .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	individuals have proposed stopping such drugs due to concern over up - regulation of the ace2 receptor acting as the sars - cov-2 entry point ; others paradoxically suggest prescribing this class of drugs to counteract a dysregulated angiotensinaldosterone system .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	we therefore explore the links between the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system ( raas ) and the ace2 receptor specifically ; expanding on the observation that hypertension is prevalent among those diagnosed with covid-19 .

69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	the raas is well characterized in hypertension , heart failure , and beyond .

69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	i ( ang i ) to ang ii , predominantly in the lungs .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	the effects of ang ii are dependent on receptor binding :
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	at1 receptor binding stimulates the classical effects of ang ii , ranging from increased oxidative stress , through to vasoconstriction ; in principle , at2 receptor regulates opposing effects .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	ace2 is an enzyme attached to cell membranes in the lungs , endothelium , and heart , as well as the kidneys .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	its main pharmacological effect is to lower blood pressure by catalysing the cleavage of ang i to ang 1 - 9 and of ang ii to ang 1 - 7 ( vasodilatory , anti - inflammatory activity ) .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	ace2 has additional affinity for other vasoactive substrates , including apelin-13 and bradykinin .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	soluble ace2 has also been described , cleaved from the cell surface but with a preserved catalytic activity .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	a sex difference exists , with men displaying higher ace2 levels .

69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	2 • hospitalization due to heart failure in the same cohort was associated with higher ace2 with a hr of 1.0 ( 95 % ci 1.4 - 11.5 , p = 0.009 ) .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	2 • post - operative ace2 levels following orthopaedic surgery in 187 patients were significantly greater in patients with a subsequent inhospital cardiac event ( 25.3 vs. 39.5 pmol / ml / min , p = 0.012 ) , though this did not remain significant in multivariate analysis .

69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	in 103 participants , increased ace2 activity was associated with hypertension , impaired left ventricular systolic function , and older age ; atrial fibrillation ( p = 0.04 ) and vascular disease ( p < 0.01 ) were independent predictors of plasma ace2 activity .

69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	differing rates of ace inhibitor / arb use between groups is important considering the aforementioned effect on membrane - bound ace2 , and a largely unknown effect on soluble ace2 .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	is ace2 up - regulated by ace inhibitor / arb use , and does this facilitate covid-19 cell entry and increase severity of infection ? :
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	the concept of the up - regulation of ace2 arises from animal studies ; with rats demonstrating reduced plasma ang ii , increased ace2 mrna , and higher plasma
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	ang 1 - 7 in response to lisinopril or enalapril , and the latter two effects also found with losartan .

69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	however , conflicting evidence can also be found , with ramipril failing to increase ace2 despite a similar duration of ace inhibition .

69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	this leads to the converse argument , that arbs could reduce sars - cov-2 cell entry by reducing availability of binding sites and reducing internalization of ace2 .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	however , a virus only needs one receptor to infect a cell , and the effect of arb on ang ii breakdown to ang 1 - 7 was not studied .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	there has not been any good evidence of ace2 up - regulation associated with these drugs in humans 2,3 and , despite 61 % sequence similarity between ace1 and ace2 , ace inhibitors do not effect ace2 receptors .
69653910683d44072cf8805fe50e16c5317e5b5b	it is notable that animal work is predominantly based on tissue expression , and human work on soluble / circulating ace2 , when the relationship between these remains unclear .

9306cdc04e064ce1f94afebefa524724bd5e1cfc	here , we report that the arabidopsis hy5 functions as a novel dna - binding tag ( dbtag ) for proteins .
9306cdc04e064ce1f94afebefa524724bd5e1cfc	we also demonstrate that the dbtagged proteins could be immobilized and purified on a newly designed agarose / dna microplate .
9306cdc04e064ce1f94afebefa524724bd5e1cfc	furthermore , we show three applications using the microarray :
9306cdc04e064ce1f94afebefa524724bd5e1cfc	( 1 ) detection of autophosphorylation activity of dbtagged human protein kinases and inhibition of their activity by staurosporine , ( 2 ) specific cleavage of dbtagged proteins by a virus protease and caspase 3 , and ( 3 ) detection of a protein - protein interaction between the dbtagged ube2n and ube2v1 .

5c9372cbcf5acd3ce0e9ba3c3aa9e6a75bf9ed5a	although the manifestations of coronavirus infection ( i.e. , rhinorrhea , sneezing , cough , nasal obstruction , and bronchitis ) are generally self - limiting in healthy adults , certain strains such as hcov - nl63 and hcov - hku1 can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection and febrile seizure , especially in infants , people of advanced age , and immunocompromised hosts .
5c9372cbcf5acd3ce0e9ba3c3aa9e6a75bf9ed5a	in 2003 , a novel hcov strain was identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) epidemic that began in asia in 2002 .

24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	we present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	we analyze data from new york city 's ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014 - 2016 .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	for monitored individuals , we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at " low ( but not zero ) risk " and " some or high risk " : 21 and 31 days , respectively .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	extending our analysis to smallpox and mers - cov , we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to ebola due to less variable incubation periods .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	active monitoring can save lives but is expensive .
24f1d3b412c3e8fcbbd6807643cc193ef00b5ed8	resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure - risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	since the earliest descriptions of cmv reactivation in immune competent hosts , there have now been more than 20 studies demonstrating reactivation in non - immunesuppressed patients during critical illness .

f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	cmv reactivation has been linked to bacterial sepsis and likely results from inflammation , transient immune compromise , and viral epigenetic changes .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	while cmv may improve immune response to some bacterial infections , other data suggest that cmv induces exaggerated responses to severe infections that may be harmful to latently infected hosts .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	these results also suggest that previous infection history may explain significant differences seen between human septic responses and murine models of sepsis .
f2dfb3e4a85c62b7d907812f27c1058c05243574	while critically ill human hosts clearly have worse outcomes associated with cmv reactivation , determining causality remains an area of investigation , with randomized control trials currently being performed .

281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	floods are some of the most common and destructive natural disasters in the world , potentially leading to both physical injuries and psychological disorders , including post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) .
281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	ptsd can damage functional capacity and interfere with social functioning .
281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	however , little is known about recovery from ptsd after floods .
281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	this study used 2013 - 2014 follow - up data on survivors of the 1998 dongting lake flood who were diagnosed with ptsd in 2000 to measure the prevalence rate of ptsd at follow - up and identify predictors of recovery from the ptsd diagnosis in 2000 .
281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	methods :
281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	participants included survivors who had been diagnosed as having ptsd in 2000 after the 1998 dongting lake flood .

281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	conclusions :
281ed09feadb379021bb0d63faa25b484ca482f1	the prevalence rate of ptsd at follow - up indicates that natural disasters such as floods may have a negative influence on survivors ' mental health for an extended period of time .

d8adb6cbcaecb60b51fafaf0d20c1b1218207fc0	several studies suggest that the open reading frame 3 ( orf3 ) gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) is related to viral infectivity and pathogenicity , but its function remains unknown .
d8adb6cbcaecb60b51fafaf0d20c1b1218207fc0	here , we propose a structure model of the orf3 protein consisting of four tm domains and forming a tetrameric assembly .
d8adb6cbcaecb60b51fafaf0d20c1b1218207fc0	orf3 protein can be detected in pedv - infected cells and it functions as an ion channel in both xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast .
d8adb6cbcaecb60b51fafaf0d20c1b1218207fc0	mutation analysis showed that tyr170 in tm4 is important for potassium channel activity .
d8adb6cbcaecb60b51fafaf0d20c1b1218207fc0	furthermore , viral production is reduced in infected vero cells when orf3 gene is silenced by sirna .
d8adb6cbcaecb60b51fafaf0d20c1b1218207fc0	interestingly , the orf3 gene from an attenuated pedv encodes a truncated protein with 49 nucleotide deletions , which lacks the ion channel activity .

ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802	viral respiratory infections have been associated with up to 80 % of wheezing episodes and asthma exacerbations .
ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802	however , studies on the role of these viruses in asthmatic patients in the interval between exacerbations are sparse .
ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802	this study aimed to determine the presence of respiratory viruses , without symptoms of infection , in the airways of young asthmatics as compared to healthy controls .
ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802	material and methods : patients 10e35 years of age with stable asthma and a group of healthy controls were analyzed regarding the presence of rna from common respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates by pcr .

ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802	absence of symptoms of respiratory tract infection notwithstanding
ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802	, hrv seems to be more prevalent in the airways of adolescents and young adults with asthma and a high degree of aeroallergen ige sensitisation than in controls .
ef3c9390b2dac4ab54e3bd766b7bb28d03511802	the presence of hrv seems also to be related to systemic eosinophilic inflammation despite ongoing treatment with inhaled corticosteroids .

f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	in many enveloped virus families , including hiv and hsv , a crucial , yet unexploited , step in the viral life cycle is releasing particles from the infected cell membranes .
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	this release process is mediated by host escrt complex proteins , which is recruited by viral structural proteins and provides the mechanical means for membrane scission and subsequent viral budding .
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	the prazole drug , tenatoprazole , was previously shown to bind to escrt complex member tsg101 and quantitatively block the release of infectious hiv-1 from cells in culture .
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	in this report we show that tenatoprazole and a related prazole drug , ilaprazole , effectively block infectious herpes simplex virus
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	( hsv)-1/2 release from vero cells in culture .
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	by electron microscopy , we found that both prazole drugs block the release of hsv particles from the cell nuclear membrane resulting in their accumulation in the nucleus .
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	ilaprazole also quantitatively blocks the release of hiv-1 from 293 t cells with an ec50 of 0.8 µm , which is more potent than tenatoprazole .
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	finally , we synthesized and tested multiple novel prazole - based analogs that demonstrate both binding to tsg101 and inhibition of viral egress in the nanomolar range of hiv-1 from 293 t cells .
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	our results indicate that prazole - based compounds may represent a class of drugs with potential to be broad - spectrum antiviral agents against multiple enveloped viruses , by interrupting cellular tsg101 interaction with maturing virus , thus blocking the budding process that releases particles from the cell .
f14ac93b0e406298a8d49fa12b0fedfd6872273c	these results provide the basis for the development of drugs that target enveloped virus budding that can be used ultimately to control multiple virus infections in humans .

6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	monostroma nitidum is a green single - cell layered algae that grows on the southwest coast of japan .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	it is often used for salad ingredients , boiled tsukudani , soups , etc . , due to its health benefits .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	m. nitidum is composed of many cell aggregates , and the various substances that fill the intercellular space are dietary fibers , vitamins , and minerals .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	rhamnan sulfate ( rs ) , a sulfated polysaccharide , is main the component of the fiber extracted from m. nitidum .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	recently , some biological properties of rs have been demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies that probably protect human subjects from viruses and ameliorate vascular dysfunction caused by metabolic disorders , especially lifestyle - related diseases .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	in this review , we focus on the antithrombotic effects of rs and introduce its antiviral and other biological activities .

6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	( kii peninsula , kyushu , and nansei islands ) , korean peninsula , and southern china .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	in japan , seaweed farming is also being practiced in the southwest coastal areas of mie , kumamoto , kagoshima , nagasaki , and okinawa prefectures .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	it is particularly popular in matoya bay , ago bay , ise bay , and gokasho bay in mie prefecture , accounting for about 70 % of the total production in japan .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	m. nitidum is a healthpromoting food that contains dietary fibers consisting of polysaccharides , minerals , and proteins , and it has been used extensively for nori boiled in soy sauce , miso soups , and salads .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	cell walls of m. nitidum contain a large amount of rhamnan sulfate ( rs ) , a sulfated polysaccharide [ 4 , 5 ] .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	although this macromolecule is poorly soluble in water , it can be solubilized and decomposed into smaller molecules by treating m. nitidum with hot water .
6bf68b0ab3fb6bbfd4bf5a1dad6dccfc557cd498	the obtained extract is purified by anion - exchange resin column chromatography ; sulfated substances bind to the column and are subsequently eluted from the column by increasing the concentration of sodium chloride .

776a2bf0b1763d20b33b2f93f835170a888dfc39	the reformist seasons of the last 25 years mostly shared the same principles , goals and weaknesses in their implementation phases .
776a2bf0b1763d20b33b2f93f835170a888dfc39	the vicious cycle of administrative reforms has not been defused : the widespread disagreement in the policy community against further waves of comprehensive reform is an indicator of a persistent low degree of practical implementation , and rather of the prevalence of contradictory effects with respect to reforming principles and goals , like the performance evaluation introduced by statute in 2009 .
776a2bf0b1763d20b33b2f93f835170a888dfc39	creeping resistance within administrations is a constant presence , apparently unaffected by several waves of normative innovation .
776a2bf0b1763d20b33b2f93f835170a888dfc39	notwithstanding the recent call for " concreteness " of the five - star movement and league " government of change " , we find that the lack of empirical , in - depth organizational analysis gives the real measure of current complexity to be dealt with .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	single - stranded rna viruses such as alphaviruses , flaviviruses , measles viruses and rhabdoviruses are characterized by their capacity of highly efficient self - amplification of rna in host cells , which make them attractive vehicles for vaccine development .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	particularly , alphaviruses and flaviviruses can be administered as recombinant particles , layered dna / rna plasmid vectors carrying the rna replicon and even rna replicon molecules .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	self - amplifying rna viral vectors have been used for high level expression of viral and tumor antigens , which in immunization studies have elicited strong cellular and humoral immune responses in animal models .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	vaccination has provided protection against challenges with lethal doses of viral pathogens and tumor cells .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	moreover , clinical trials have demonstrated safe application of rna viral vectors and even promising results in rhabdovirus - based phase iii trials on an ebola virus vaccine .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	preclinical and clinical applications of self - amplifying rna viral vectors have proven efficient for vaccine development and due to the presence of rna replicons , amplification of rna in host cells will generate superior immune responses with significantly reduced amounts of rna delivered .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	the need for novel and efficient vaccines has become even more evident due to the global covid-19 pandemic , which has further highlighted the urgency in challenging emerging diseases .

768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	in the context of mrna - based vaccines , self - replicating rna viruses present an interesting and attractive alternative as described below [ 6 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	the common feature of self - amplifying rna viruses is their single - stranded rna ( ssrna )
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	genome embedded in a capsid and envelope protein structure [ 6 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	in the case of alphaviruses and flaviviruses , the ssrna genome is of positive polarity in contrast to measles viruses ( mvs ) and rhabdoviruses , which carry a negative sense ssrna
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	genome .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	in any case , the rna genome of self - amplifying rna viruses can act directly in the cytoplasm without any need of nucleic acid delivery to the nucleus .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	in the case of positive polarity , the translation can be initiated directly from the incoming ssrna genome [ 7 ] , whereas negative sense rna molecules require the generation of a positive strand rna template [ 8 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	all self - amplifying rna viruses initially express their nonstructural genes resulting in the formation of the rna replication complex ( rna replicon ) , responsible for extreme rna replication in infected host cells [ 7 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	it has been estimated that 200,000 copies of rna are made from a single rna molecule , providing together with strong subgenomic promoters the basis for extremely high expression levels of viral proteins .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	this feature has been taken advantage of in expression vectors engineered from self - amplifying rna viruses , which have been applied for mammalian and non - mammalian cell lines , primary cells and in vivo [ 9 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	moreover , self - amplifying rna virus vectors have been used for vaccine development , targeting both infectious diseases and different types of cancers .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	in this review , the basic function of self - replicating rna virus vectors is described , and various preclinical and clinical applications are presented .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	although efficient expression systems have been developed for alphaviruses , flaviviruses , mvs and rhabdoviruses , the differences in the polarity of the ssrna genome have required alternative engineering .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	in the case of alphaviruses and flaviviruses , the procedure is straightforward , whereas mvs and rhabdoviruses require the utilization of packaging cell lines and reverse genetics .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	for simplicity , the focus is here on the illustration of the semliki forest virus ( sfv)-based expression system , one of the most commonly applied alphavirus expression systems ( figure 1 ) .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	alphaviruses belong to the family of togaviruses [ 7 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	particularly , sfv [ 10 ] , sindbis virus ( sin ) [ 11 ] and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus ( vee ) [ 12 ] have been used for the engineering of expression vector systems .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	in this context , engineering of an expression vector carrying the sfv nonstructural protein genes ( nsp1 - 4 ) , where the gene of interest can be inserted downstream of the strong 26s subgenomic promoter allows in vitro transcribed rna to be directly translated in cell lines and in vivo
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	( figure 1 ) .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	alternatively , replacement of the sp6 or t7 rna polymerase promoter upstream of the nsp1 - 4 region with a cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) promoter permits direct use of plasmid dna in vitro or in vivo [ 13 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	another possibility is to co - transfect in vitro transcribed rna from the expression vector and a helper vector expressing the sfv structural protein genes into mammalian host cells for production of replication deficient sfv particles .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	the reason for replication deficiency relates to the presence of the packaging signal in the nsp2 region of the expression vector , which prevents the packaging of the rna from the helper vector [ 14 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	additionally , to reduce the formation of any replication proficient sfv particles , the second generation
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	psfv - helper 2 vector was engineered [ 15 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	furthermore , for total elimination of rna recombination and generation of replication proficient sfv particles a two - helper system with the capsid and spike protein genes on separated vectors was applied [ 16 ] .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	finally , a full - length sfv genome with a second 26s subgenomic promoter and gene of interest introduced either downstream of the nsp genes or the structural genes can be applied , keeping in mind that replication proficient particles will be generated , obviously enhancing biosafety risks .
768496cbd3039507a75e2021cad8d524c3463256	in any case , the options and flexibility are excellent as alphavirus vectors can be used for vaccine development in the form of naked rna replicons , dna plasmid vectors and recombinant viral particles as described in more detail in the next sections .

e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	iavs cause a wide range of clinical illnesses , from relatively mild infections by seasonal strains , to acute respiratory distress during infections with highly pathogenic avian iavs ( hpai ) .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	for this study , we infected a549 human lung cells with lab prototype a / pr/8/34 ( h1n1 )

e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	we used a newly - developed aptamer - based multiplexed technique ( somascan ® ) to examine > 1300 human lung cell proteins affected by the different iav strains , and identified more than 500 significantly dysregulated cellular proteins .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	our analyses indicated that the avian strains induced more profound changes in the a549 global proteome compared to all tested low - pathogenicity h1n1 strains .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	the pr8 strain induced a general activation , primarily by upregulating many immune molecules , the seasonal rv733 and pdm09 strains had minimal effect upon assayed molecules , and the avian strains induced significant downregulation , primarily in antimicrobial response , cardiovascular and post - translational modification systems .

e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	there has also been a sporadic but highly lethal spread of h5n1 and h7n9 from birds to humans [ 9 ] .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	several anti - viral strategies , including small molecule inhibitors and yearly re - formulated vaccines , have been developed to combat iav , but the virus extensive genetic plasticity , caused by an error - prone polymerase and capacity to mix genetic content , often leads to resistance to virus - targeted anti - viral strategies .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	because all viruses are obligate parasites , and must therefore make widespread use of host cell machinery , an alternate anti - viral strategy that is being explored would be to elucidate host factors that are required by , and modulated by , the virus , for its successful pathogenicity and propagation .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	we [ 10 - 13 ] and others [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	[ 17 ] have used mass - spectrometry ( ms)-based non - biased quantitative strategies to measure how iav affects the host cell proteome .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	each of these assays identified thousands of cellular proteins , and collectively , these studies have determined dysregulation of various pathways , such as acetylation , cell structure , defense responses , protein binding , responses to stress , stimulus and virus , alternative splicing , localization , transport , protein binding and nucleoside , nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	however , these non - biased global types of strategies have a few limitations .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	first , since the more abundant proteins are likely to be identified by ms , the less abundant proteins , many of which play key functions , are more likely to be missed .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	in addition , there usually is less than 100 % overlap between replicate ms - identified samples .
e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	multiplex protein arrays have the potential to overcome such limitations , but most are antibody - based and currently limited to a few hundred analytes .

e524930698458785e91b9bba94f0d6860a911b06	we used this technology to complement our earlier quantitative ms - based studies and identified numerous low - abundant proteins , including cytokines and chemokines that are differentially dysregulated by iav associated with no or mild human infection , compared to h5n1 and h7n9 strains associated with highly pathogenic human infection .
bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5	the current retrospective study examined thought control strategies , or cognitive techniques individuals use to deal with unpleasant thoughts following stressful events , as potential mediators of adjustment in young women with histories of child sexual abuse ( csa ) .
bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5	in a sample of 76 undergraduate women who self - reported on abuse experiences , thought control strategies , and current trauma symptoms , several key findings emerged : ( i )
bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5	greater severity of the csa event was associated with greater reported use of worry and punishment strategies and less use of social control strategies
bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5	; ( ii ) increased use of worry and punishment strategies following the csa event was associated with greater levels of trauma symptoms , while increased use of social control strategies following the csa event was associated with lower levels of trauma symptoms ; and
bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5	( iii ) worry , punishment , and social control strategies served as mediators between csa severity and trauma symptoms .
bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5	the results suggest that thought control strategies , specifically increased worry and punishment , and decreased social control , play a vital role in understanding adjustment after csa .
bc42b6fb90af86f69df77bfaaaea4941916690a5	future research should examine the roles of these cognitive control strategies as possible avenues of intervention following csa .
558198b07f72e5bf554967b826db5eada9243c83	last - mile logistics is regarded as an essential yet highly expensive component of parcel logistics .
558198b07f72e5bf554967b826db5eada9243c83	in dense urban environments , this is partially caused by inherent inefficiencies due to traffic congestion and the disparity and accessibility of customer locations .
558198b07f72e5bf554967b826db5eada9243c83	in parcel logistics , access hubs are facilities supporting relay - based last - mile activities by offering temporary storage locations enabling the decoupling of last - mile activities from the rest of the urban distribution chain .
558198b07f72e5bf554967b826db5eada9243c83	this paper focuses on a novel tactical problem : the geographically dynamic deployment of pooled relocatable storage capacity modules in an urban parcel network operating under space - time uncertainty .
558198b07f72e5bf554967b826db5eada9243c83	in particular , it proposes a two - stage stochastic optimization model for the access
558198b07f72e5bf554967b826db5eada9243c83	hub dynamic pooled capacity deployment problem with synchronization of underlying operations through travel time estimates , and a solution approach based on a rolling horizon algorithm with lookahead and a benders decomposition able to solve large scale instances of a real - sized megacity .
558198b07f72e5bf554967b826db5eada9243c83	numerical results , inspired by the case of a large parcel express carrier , are provided to evaluate the computational performance of the proposed approach and suggest up to 28 % last - mile cost savings and 26 % capacity savings compared to a static capacity deployment strategy .
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	previous studies have found large variations in the covid-19 infection fatality rate ( ifr ) .
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	this study hypothesized that ifr would be influenced by covid-19 epidemic intensity .
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	we tested the association between epidemic intensity and ifr using serological results from a recent large sars - cov-2 serosurvey ( n = 60,983 ) in 19 spanish regions .
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	the infection fatality rate for spain as a whole was 1.15 % and varied between 0.13 % and 3.25 % in the regions ( median 1.07 % , iqr 0.69 - 1.32 % ) .
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	the ifr by region was positively associated with sars - cov-2 seroprevalence ( rho = 0.54 ; p = 0.0162 ) , cases/100,000 ( rho = 0.75 ; p = 0.002 ) , hospitalizations/100,000 ( rho = 0.78 ; p = 0.0001 ) , mortality/100,000 ( rho = 0.77 ; p = 0.0001 ) and case fatality rate ( rho = 0.49 ; p = 0.0327 ) .
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	these results suggest that the sars - cov-2 ifr is not fixed .
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	the spanish regions with more rapid and extensive spread of sars - cov-2 had higher ifrs .
4e16c83f758987cd75d3a4dbc6542fd326bce05e	these findings are compatible with the theory that slowing the spread of covid-19 down reduces the ifr and case fatality rate via preventing hospitals from being overrun , and thus allowing better and lifesaving care .

ff6b55c00278cf8081dec1ad430940165b23d91e	methods :
ff6b55c00278cf8081dec1ad430940165b23d91e	from september 1 , 2003-august 31 , 2005 , we tested hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory illness and outpatient controls without fever or respiratory symptoms for hrvs with polymerase chain reaction and molecularlytyped select hrvs .
ff6b55c00278cf8081dec1ad430940165b23d91e	we compared hrv detection among hospitalized patients and controls and estimated enrollment adjusted incidence .
ff6b55c00278cf8081dec1ad430940165b23d91e	results :
ff6b55c00278cf8081dec1ad430940165b23d91e	hrvs were detected in 315 ( 16 % ) of 1919 hospitalized patients and 27 ( 9.6 % ) of 280 controls .
ff6b55c00278cf8081dec1ad430940165b23d91e	children had the highest frequency of hrv detections ( hospitalized : , 1 year : 29 % , 1 - 4 year : 29 % , $ 65 years : 9 % ; controls : , 1 year : 24 % , 1 - 4 year : 14 % , $ 65 years : 2.8 % ) .

f3c10470815b973ad8057f0ab1b878fa71dfea3e	the issues discussed in accepted article this debate are intended to guide and assist clinicians , both in assessment and intervention , in adjusting to the use of virtual care for patients with bipolar disorder .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	mutual information ( mi ) based feature selection methods are popular due to their ability to capture the nonlinear relationship among variables .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	however , existing works rarely address the error ( bias ) that occurs due to the use of finite samples during the estimation of mi .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	to the best of our knowledge , none of the existing methods address the bias issue for the high - order interaction term which is essential for better approximation of joint mi .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	in this paper , we first calculate the amount of bias of this term .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	moreover , to select features using χ 2 based search , we also show that this term follows χ 2 distribution .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	based on these two theoretical results , we propose discretization and feature selection based on bias corrected mutual information ( dsbm ) .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	dsbm is extended by adding simultaneous forward selection and backward elimination ( dsbm fb ) .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	we demonstrate the superiority of dsbm over four state - of - the - art methods in terms of accuracy and the number of selected features on twenty benchmark datasets .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	experimental results also demonstrate that dsbm outperforms the existing methods in terms of accuracy , pareto optimality and friedman test .
71e3321180fc3b618a4d87956fa1e7aab7c94d57	we also observe that compared to dsbm , in some dataset dsbm fb selects fewer features and increases accuracy .

c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec	the inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal .
c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec	strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen , phenylbutazone , and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin , which does not block cyclooxygenase function , was inactive .
c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec	enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin - treated hep-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin el , cyclic amp , or insulin .
c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec	conversely , indomethacin - treated cells remained restrictive for vsv if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional dna ( actinomycin d or mitomycin c ) , messenger rna synthesis ( cu - amanitin ) , or protein synthesis ( cycloheximide ) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication .
c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec	pretreatment of hep-2 cells with mitomycin c markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin - mediated inhibition of vsv from a 90 % inhibitory dose of about 10e4 m to one of lo-
c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec	' m or lower .
c347c33ebbdc6fa40f150a2b3c7ce045a09e37ec	these findings suggest that preexisting host factors essential for replication of wv , although rendered nonfunctional by the drug indomethacin , can be replenished unless their synthesis is blocked by various classes of metabolic inhibitors .

efd3a0adec621ead095b64ec9a3440f12af64ba8	the human gut microbiota has been the interest of extensive research in recent years and our knowledge on using the potential capacity of these microbes are growing rapidly .
efd3a0adec621ead095b64ec9a3440f12af64ba8	microorganisms colonized throughout the gastrointestinal tract of human are coevolved through symbiotic relationship and can influence physiology , metabolism , nutrition and immune functions of an individual .
efd3a0adec621ead095b64ec9a3440f12af64ba8	the gut microbes are directly involved in conferring protection against pathogen colonization by inducing direct killing , competing with nutrients and enhancing the response of the gut - associated immune repertoire .
efd3a0adec621ead095b64ec9a3440f12af64ba8	damage in the microbiome ( dysbiosis ) is linked with several life - threatening outcomes viz .
efd3a0adec621ead095b64ec9a3440f12af64ba8	inflammatory bowel disease , cancer , obesity , allergy , and auto - immune disorders .
efd3a0adec621ead095b64ec9a3440f12af64ba8	therefore , the manipulation of human gut microbiota came out as a potential choice for therapeutic intervention of the several human diseases .
efd3a0adec621ead095b64ec9a3440f12af64ba8	herein , we review significant studies emphasizing the influence of the gut microbiota on the regulation of host responses in combating infectious and inflammatory diseases alongside describing the promises of gut microbes as future therapeutics .

7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	primates along with many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic ecological conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	one of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes , and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	bonobos , like chimpanzees , might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	little is known , however , about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	in this study , we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest - savannah mosaics .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species , including an important number of non - tree species ( liana , herb and savannah shrub ) , in comparison to populations living in dense forests .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	these non - tree plants have been defined as fallback and non - preferred foods , which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	interestingly , we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	this finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding , as they do for nesting , but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	finally , we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits : musanga cecropioides and marantochloa leucantha .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups , as observed at this study site .
7aa5e0d2e233439d838cc4ce6e2c743b9a5026db	our findings suggest that bonobos living in forestsavannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers .

ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	for over 30 years , hiv / aids has wreaked havoc in the world .
ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	in the absence of an effective vaccine for hiv , development of new anti - hiv agents is urgently needed .
ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	we previously identified the antiviral activities of the scorpion - venom - peptidederived mucroporin - m1 for three rna viruses ( measles viruses , sars - cov , and h5n1 ) .
ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	in this investigation , a panel of scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives were designed and chosen for assessment of their anti - hiv activities .
ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	a new scorpion venom peptide derivative kn2 - 7 was identified as the most potent anti - hiv-1 peptide by screening assays with an ec 50 value of 2.76 mg / ml ( 1.65 mm ) and showed low cytotoxicity to host cells with a selective index ( si ) of 13.93 .
ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	kn2 - 7 could inhibit all members of a standard reference panel of hiv-1 subtype b pseudotyped virus ( pv ) with ccr5-tropic and cxcr4tropic nl4 - 3 pv strain .
ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	furthermore , it also inhibited a cxcr4-tropic replication - competent strain of hiv-1 subtype b virus .
ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	binding assay of kn2 - 7 to hiv-1 pv by octet red system suggested the anti - hiv-1 activity was correlated with a direct interaction between kn2 - 7 and hiv-1 envelope .
ca7514c743f1cab0c939328f75ff231ba9d9079d	these results demonstrated that peptide kn2 - 7 could inhibit hiv-1 by direct interaction with viral particle and may become a promising candidate compound for further development of microbicide against hiv-1 .

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	2d:4d is sexually dimorphic ( males < females ) .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	studies , linking digit ratio and full facial shapes among europeans , show that a low 2d:4d is associated with a set of malespecific facial features .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	buryats -mongolian people from southern siberiademonstrate a different pattern of facial sexual dimorphism than europeans ( narrower and more vertically elongated faces in men as opposed to women ) .

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between facial shape and the 2d:4d in comparison to the pattern of facial sexual dimorphism in buryats .

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	to assess relationship between facial shape and 2d:4d
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	we used a geometric morphometric approach based on standardized full - face frontal photographs and direct measurements of the digit lengths among right - handed individuals .

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	the results revealed that 2d:4d was associated with facial morphology in buryat men , and to a lesser extent in women .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	narrower faces , elongated in the vertical direction , and a narrower lower facial outline , were characteristic of buryat men with low 2d:4d ratios , which corresponded to the male - like facial shapes in buryats .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	in europeans , such facial features were reported for men with high 2d:4d , which corresponded to female - like european facial shapes .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	hence , our results show that sex - specific morphogenesis in humans is multidirectional , and that digit ratio is capable of predicting sexspecific facial traits even in populations with differing sexually - dimorphic morphology .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	during the last decades , the 2 nd -to-4 th digits ratio ( 2d:4d ) has been extensively studied as a putative predictor of a prenatal exposure to sex hormonesin humans [ 1 ] [ 2 ]

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	for many human populations , the 2d:4dhas been reported to be sexually dimorphic ( with higher values in women )

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	the role of the 2d:4d as a marker is also supported by numerous studies reporting its association with sexspecific morphology and behaviour in humans [ 10 , [ 20 ]

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	surprisingly , researchon the 2d:4d ratioin combination withfacial morphology are very rare .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	few comprehensive studies , linkingdigit ratio and full facial shapesamong representatives of european populations [ 23 , 26 , 46 ] , have demonstrated that a low 2d:4d ( a typically male trait)shows association with a set of population - specific male facial features , but with an admixture of some other , unrelated to chromosomal sex , patterns [ 23 ] .the
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	associationbetween 2d:4d and facial shapewas alsoreported to be especially pronounced in men [ 23 ]
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	.another study , also focusing on a full - facial shape analysis among europeans , has revealed that male - specific facial traits occur in boys even prior to puberty , and arenegatively associated with the 2d:4d ratio [ 25 ] .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	sex - specific facial morphology may be subjected to population differences .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	a number of studies provide evidence that , leastways , such differences occur between europeanand asian populations .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	primary differencesare located in such facial areas as the lower face , which in europeans tend to demonstrate higher widths in men , and in asiansin women [ 23 , 32 , 35 , [ 37 ]

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	therefore , it is ofa special interest to explore whether the association between 2d:4d and facial morphology in different populationscorresponds to the observed variation in facial sexual dimorphism .

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	the average face here is deformed towards ± 5 standard deviations of 2d:4d from that mean .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	according to the deformation grids displayed in fig.1b , low 2d:4d(which presumably indicates a high level of prenatal androgenization ) in menwas associated with male - relatedfacial features (
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	fig . 1a ) , such as a relatively narrower face with larger general height in the vertical plane , a journal pre - proof j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f

7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	at the same time high 2d:4d(low prenatal androgenization ) in men was associated with some characteristics typical of women in that population .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	however , not all of the sexspecificmorphometric traitscorresponded to the variation in facial shape explained by the 2d:4d ratio in men .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	namely , such parameters are thedistance between the eyes and eyebrows as well as relativeforehead height , which aredistinctive features for menand women , but remained unaffected or demonstrated a reverse patternwhen seen as a function of 2d:4d ratios .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	thus , the main differences associated with 2d:4dare locatedin the mid - and lower part of the male face ( in the craniofacial segment ) , whereas the area of the frontal bone ( including forehead and the eyebrow region ) did not show differencesin expected direction .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	in women with higher 2d:4d ratios , the relatively wider spacing of eyebrows and eyes reflect the female pattern , whereas the relatively more massive chin region and lower hairline do not fit the other patterns .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	the diminutiveness of shape changes even if presented for ±5 sd supports the comparably weak relationship between 2d:4d and facial shape in women .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	our study demonstratedthat2d:4d ratio , as a putative proxy for prenatal androgen exposure , isassociated withmale facial morphology , which has also been previously reported forother populations [ 23 , 25 , 26 , 46 ] .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	however , a comparison of our results with the results of thesestudiesshows that the pattern of facial sexual dimorphism , and accordingly the shape pattern of the association with 2d:4d differs between populations .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	generally narrower faces , elongated in the vertical direction , and particularly a narrower lower facial outline , were characteristic of men ( and boys ) of european origin with high 2d:4d ratios .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	this in turn at least partly corresponded to thefemale - likefacial shapes in thatpopulation ( europeans ) .
7153c60e4bd8af7443735f47c9455b154d54fab3	at the same time , low 2d:4d ratios in those studies were characteristic of men with relatively wider faces(especially in journal pre - proof psychoneuroendocrinology 32(4 )

48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	it is evident that remote work reduces distractions and maximizes the pro capite outcome of the single worker ; however , the individual who spends his / her time in a stimulating environment , exchanging ideas and knowledge , increases not only his own creativity and inventiveness but even also those of the group he works with .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	in the anglo - saxon culture , the term " water cooler talk " or " water cooler conversation " is what happens when colleagues take a break from work - related tasks and discuss their hobbies , interests , and personal issues .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	great ideas have always arisen thanks to interpersonal exchanges .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	it is not possible to replace the disruptive effect of contact and physical interaction between researchers , teachers , and students as it happens in a university context .

48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	in the medical - surgical field in general and especially in plastic surgery , the pandemic has generated the flowering of countless webinars sponsored by the national or international medical scientific societies when not organized by doctors considered points of reference for special topics as an alternative to the conferences that have necessarily been postponed due to covid-19 pandemic effect .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	these circumstances have allowed the state of the art updating but in the meantime , it has generated at least two critical issues whose impact will have to be followed over time [ 2 ] .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	the first critical issue is technical : the internet guarantees immediate access to great number of information in an attempt to universalize knowledge , but who checks and certifies the correctness of the information given by the faculties of the webinar ?
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	moreover , who is able to verify how these new pieces of information are learnt ?
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	what 's the impact on personal surgical activity ?
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	in fact , it is quite different to participate in the live conferences where close contact with tutors and mentors is provided , instead of listening to a webinar .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	the second important point is the so - called human - factor ( this term is borrowed from the well - known growth factors in the biological field ) : medical knowledge has always benefited from the union of different thinking heads .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	in fact , many terms , entered into the daily practice as " brain storming " and " open space , " generate the idea of a synergetic effect where inventiveness is enhanced through the physical contact , thanks to unexpected stimuli and contributions .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	solo learning has been a fallback for this pandemic period but will never replace the role of the social impact on the knowledge progress .
48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	the process of acquiring knowledge is not only the result of a sum of notions , but it grows through the relationships between the new concepts acquired and the experience completed and enriched by the interaction with other people .

48b99188eb765bde8b3920150cf680c8d42d79d4	in life , a person can take one of two attitudes : to build or to plant .

44195af211f16a2269ca356d54b92858f558509c	very little is known about the infection mechanism for this virus .
44195af211f16a2269ca356d54b92858f558509c	more importantly , there are no drugs or vaccines that can cure or prevent a person from getting covid-19 .
44195af211f16a2269ca356d54b92858f558509c	in this study , the binding affinity of 2692 protease inhibitor compounds that are known in the protein data bank , are calculated against the main protease of the novel coronavirus with docking and molecular dynamics ( md ) .
44195af211f16a2269ca356d54b92858f558509c	both the docking and md methods predict the macrocyclic tissue factor - factor viia ( pubchem id : 118098670 ) inhibitor to bind strongly with the main protease with a binding affinity of à10.6 and à10.0 kcal / mol , respectively .
44195af211f16a2269ca356d54b92858f558509c	the tf - fviia inhibitors are known to prevent the coagulation of blood and have antiviral activity as shown in the case of sars coronavirus .

44195af211f16a2269ca356d54b92858f558509c	furthermore , these inhibitors interact with the catalytic dyad in the active site of the covid-19 main protease that is especially important in viral replication .
44195af211f16a2269ca356d54b92858f558509c	the calculated theoretical dissociation constants of the proposed covid-19 inhibitors are found to be very similar to the experimental dissociation constant values of similar protease - inhibitor systems .

398d903896858b2aecf8c6deb470847d702b2138	despite this , older adults remain vastly underrepresented in research that sets the standards for cancer treatments and , consequently , clinicians struggle with how to interpret data from clinical trials and apply them to older adults in practice .

a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	introduction :
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	igg immunoassays have been developed and used widely for clinical samples and serosurveys for sars - cov2 , with most detecting antibodies against the spike / receptor - binding - domain or nucleocapsid .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	limited information is available on comparative evaluation of igg immunoassays against a clinical reference standard , i.e. , rt - pcr positivity with > 20 days of illness .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	this study addresses the need for comparing clinical performance of igg immunoassays with respect to this alternate reference standard .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	methods :
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	we compared the performance of three immunoassays , an in - house rbd assay , and two commercial assays , the diasorin liaison sars - cov-2 s1 / s1 igg clia which detects antibodies against s1 / s2 domains of the spike protein and the zydus kavach assay based on inactivated virus using a well - characterized panel of sera .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	379 sera and plasma samples from rtpcr positive individuals > 20 days of illness in symptomatic or rt - pcr positivity in asymptomatic individuals and 184 samples collected prior to 2019 were used for assay evaluation .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	results :
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	the sensitivity of the assays were 84.7 ( 95%ci 80.6 -88.1 ) , 82.6 ( 95%ci 78.3 -86.2 ) and 75.7 (
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	95%ci 71.0 -79.9 )
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	respectively for rbd , liaison and kavach .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	kavach and the in - house rbd elisa showed a specificity of 99.5 % and 100 % , respectively .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	the rbd and liaison ( s1 / s2 )
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	assays showed high agreement ( 94.7 % ; 95%ci : 92.0 , 96.6 ) and were able to correctly identify more positive sera / plasma than kavach .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	conclusion :
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	independent comparisons support the evaluation of performance characteristics of immunoassays .
a4af05ab6c930ac8a8617267a054255e1b7c91fe	all three assays are suitable for serosurveillance studies , but in low prevalence sites , estimation of exposure may require adjustment based on our findings .
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impacts of infectious diseases including avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( hereafter sars ) on international tourist arrivals in asian countries using both single datasets and panel data procedures .
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	an autoregressive moving average model together with an exogenous variables
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	( armax ) model are used to estimate the effects of these diseases in each sars - and avian flu - infected country , while a dynamic panel model is adopted to estimate the overall impact on the region of these two diseases .
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	the empirical results from both approaches are consistent and indicate that the numbers of affected cases have a significant impact on sars - affected countries but not on avian flu - affected countries .
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	however , since the potential damage arising from the avian flu and subsequent pandemic influenza is much greater than that resulting from the sars , the need to take the necessary precautions in the event of an outbreak of avian flu and pandemic influenza warrants further attention and action .
a9af6b9e4ae676bdac84c4b4d35f4051c0bc4a4c	therefore , the empirical findings of this study could add to the knowledge regarding the relationship between tourism and crisis management , especially in so far as the management of transmissible diseases is concerned .

c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	barrier tissue epithelia play an essential role in maintaining organismal homeostasis , and changes in their cellular composition have been observed in multiple human diseases .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	within the small intestinal epithelium , adult stem cells integrate diverse signals to regulate regeneration and differentiation , thereby establishing overall cellularity .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	accordingly , directing stem cell differentiation could provide a tractable approach to alter the abundance or quality of specialized cells of the small intestinal epithelium , including the secretory paneth , goblet , and enteroendocrine populations .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	yet , to date , there has been a lack of suitable tools and rigorous approaches to identify biological targets and pharmacological agents that can modify epithelial composition to enable causal testing of disease - associated changes with novel therapeutic candidates .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	to empower the search for epithelia - modifying agents , we establish a first - of - its - kind high - throughput phenotypic organoid screen .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	we demonstrate the ability to screen thousands of samples and uncover biological targets and associated small molecule inhibitors which translate to in vivo .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	this approach is enabled by employing a functional , cell - type specific , scalable assay on an organoid model designed to represent the physiological cues of in vivo paneth cell differentiation from adult intestinal stem cells .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	further , we miniaturize and adapt the organoid culture system to enable automated plating and screening , thereby providing the ability to test thousands of samples .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	strikingly , in our screen we identify inhibitors of the nuclear exporter
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	xpo1 modulate stem cell fate commitment by inducing a panepithelial stress response combined with an interruption of mitogen signaling in cycling intestinal progenitors , thereby significantly increasing the abundance of paneth cells independent of known wnt and notch differentiation cues .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	we extend our observation in vivo , demonstrating that oral administration of xpo1 inhibitor kpt-330 at doses 1,000fold lower than conventionally used in hematologic malignancies increases paneth cell abundance .
c59f11598c5a2891c711a10a353c59b0f3d7a0bc	in total , we provide a framework to identify novel biological cues and therapeutic leads to rebalance intestinal stem cell differentiation and modulate epithelial tissue composition via high - throughput phenotypic screening in rationally - designed organoid model of differentiation .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	value theory forms the bedrock of several economic paradigms .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	it shapes how economists think about the purpose and functioning of the system as a whole .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	i identify three approaches to understanding value in economics : the british classical approach , exemplified by smith and ricardo , the neoclassical approach based on marginal utility theory , and marxian value theory .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	the classical and neoclassical tradition explain exchange value by transhistorical use values .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	this gives rise to a conception of capitalism as a ' real economy ' , i.e. a system that produces goods and services for the purpose of satisfying people 's needs and wants .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	ecological economists adopt and extend the classical and neoclassical view , by predominantly studying a ' real real ' economy , i.e. matter - energy stocks and flows and ultimate social outcomes .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	this allows an ecological critique of the economic process but fails to address underlying social drivers of ecological destruction .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	marxian value theory provides a systemic ( macro ) understanding of value , which results in a realistic conception of capitalism as a monetary market economy .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	marx 's approach is the only value theory in economics that provides a fundamental critique of capitalism .
02bb0585ef07c266da73bd08b4326e9e44896744	i advocate a stronger integration of radical political economy and ecological economics to support social change .
271d5c4984943ef064dc6cb3b25af0be5600593a	this article revisits the problem of decomposing a petri net into a network of automata , a problem that has been around since the early 70s .
271d5c4984943ef064dc6cb3b25af0be5600593a	we reformulate this problem as the transformation of an ordinary , one - safe petri net into a flat , unit - safe nupn ( nested - unit petri net ) and define a quality criterion based on the number of bits required for the structural encoding of markings .
271d5c4984943ef064dc6cb3b25af0be5600593a	we propose various transformation methods , all of which we implemented in a tool chain that combines nupn tools with third - party software , such as sat solvers , smt solvers , and tools for graph colouring and finding maximal cliques .
271d5c4984943ef064dc6cb3b25af0be5600593a	we perform an extensive evaluation of these methods on a collection of more than 12,000 nets from diverse sources , including nets whose marking graph is too large for being explored exhaustively .

92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	it was shown that the free energy of duplex formation between leader transcription - regulating sequence
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	( trs - l ) and the nascent negative - strand plays a crucial role in template switch and is the driving force of coronavirus transcription .

92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	this step requires overcoming an energy threshold .
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	coronavirus nucleoprotein ( n ) plays a structural role in virus assembly and has also been shown to be important in rna synthesis .

92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	in addition , template switching , an obligatory step in cov transcription , needs to overcome an energy threshold .
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	therefore , we asked whether rna chaperones are involved in transcription and , most importantly , if n is an rna chaperone .
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	rna chaperones are proteins that bind rna with broad specificity and that rescue rnas trapped in unproductive folding states .
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	5 - 8 one of their main characteristics is that , once the rna has been folded , they are no longer needed and , therefore , they can be removed without altering rna conformation .
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	there are three rna chaperone activities easily evaluable in vitro : ( i ) enhancement of rna ribozyme cleavage , ( ii
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	) rapid and accurate rna - rna annealing , and
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	( iii ) facilitation of rna strand transfer and exchange .
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	rna chaperones decrease the activation energy required for a transition between transcription could be interpreted as a transition between two states : in the first one , a duplex between the nascent minus
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	rna strand and the genomic positive rna used as template is formed ; in the second one , the nascent rna strand is paired with the trs of the leader .
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	therefore , rna chaperones could be involved in template switch by decreasing the energy required for the transition from the first to the second duplex ( fig . 1 ) .
92699330c9f56ce8a83809805e2f67d0b7df96a1	the last step in the current model of coronavirus transcription is a template switch
7e97f0e86c26dcb300aa58e766c14eec990e2584	background :
7e97f0e86c26dcb300aa58e766c14eec990e2584	due to the sars - cov-2 pandemic , public health interventions have been introduced globally in order to prevent the spread of the virus and avoid the overload of health care systems , especially for the most severely affected patients .
7e97f0e86c26dcb300aa58e766c14eec990e2584	scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients , identifying treatment options and developing vaccines .
7e97f0e86c26dcb300aa58e766c14eec990e2584	in germany , as in many other regions , current tests for sars - cov2 are not conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design .
7e97f0e86c26dcb300aa58e766c14eec990e2584	furthermore , knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking .
7e97f0e86c26dcb300aa58e766c14eec990e2584	nonetheless , these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and hence to appropriately design and evaluate interventions .
7e97f0e86c26dcb300aa58e766c14eec990e2584	for this purpose , we recently started a prospective population - based cohort in munich , germany , with the aim to develop a better understanding of the state and dynamics of the pandemic .

44b6eea3629b4e13595dc49813ee39a0d20dc5f2	the process of molecular adaptation following a cross - species virus transmission event is 9 currently poorly understood .
44b6eea3629b4e13595dc49813ee39a0d20dc5f2	here , we identified 137 protein sites that experienced deceleration 10 in their rate of evolution along the hiv-1 / siv phylogeny , likely indicating gain - of - function and 11 consequent adaptation .
44b6eea3629b4e13595dc49813ee39a0d20dc5f2	the majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross - species 12 transmission events and varied between hiv-1 groups , indicating independent adaptation 13 strategies .
44b6eea3629b4e13595dc49813ee39a0d20dc5f2	the evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in 14 accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors , suggesting that these factors 15 are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host .
44b6eea3629b4e13595dc49813ee39a0d20dc5f2	surprisingly , we observed that the non-16 pandemic hiv-1 group o , derived from gorillas , exhibited more rate deceleration events than 17 the pandemic group m , derived from chimpanzees .
44b6eea3629b4e13595dc49813ee39a0d20dc5f2	we suggest that the species barrier is higher 18 when the genetic distance of the hosts increases .

0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	among unsettled controversies is whether tobacco smoking increases or protects from severe covid-19 .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	several epidemiological studies reported reduced covid-19 hospitalizations among smokers , while other studies reported the opposite trend .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	some authors assumed that smokers have elevated airway expression of ace2 , the cell recognition site of the sars - cov-2 spike protein , but this suggestion remains unverified .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	we therefore performed data mining of two independent ncbi geo genome - wide rna expression files ( gse7894 and gse994 ) and report that in both data sets , current smokers and never smokers have , on average , closely similar bronchial epithelial cell mrna levels of ace2 , as well as tmprss2 , coding for a serine protease priming sars - cov-2 for cell entry , and adam17 , coding for a protease implicated in ace2 membrane shedding .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	in contrast , the expression levels of tmprss4 , coding for a protease that primes sars - cov-2 for cell entry similarly to tmprss2 , were elevated in bronchial epithelial cells from current smokers compared with never smokers , suggesting that higher bronchial tmprss4 levels in smokers might put them at higher sars - cov-2 infection risk .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	the effects of smoking on covid-19 severity need clarification with larger studies .
0c0c4dce20cebc26a1750939f69ef813a2a49b83	additionally , the postulated protective effects of nicotine and nitric oxide , which may presumably reduce the risk of a " cytokine storm " in infected individuals , deserve assessment by controlled clinical trials .

1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554	in positive samples , the presence of the most common respiratory viruses was also assayed and clinical symptoms were evaluated .
1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554	samples from 2 of the 974 infants tested positive for ev109 rna ( 0.2 % ) and belonged to patients with lower ards ; co - infection with other viral pathogens under study was observed in both cases .

1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554	sequence analysis of amplified ev109 genomic regions , showed only a few nucleotide differences when compared with the nicaraguan strains .
1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554	conclusions :
1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554	overall these results indicate that hev109 variants have circulated and differentiated in different lineages worldwide .
1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554	although more cases and larger studies are needed , hev109 infection may be associated to ards both in infants and in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients .
1808454d2e8c7d1088e58a5e3a52111a8c507554	if these preliminary observations will be confirmed , improved molecular methods with a wider panel of potential pathogens will be useful for monitoring these categories of patients .

da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	stepped - wedge designs ( swds ) are currently being used to investigate interventions to reduce opioid overdose deaths in communities located in several states .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	however , these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions , media awareness campaigns , and social distancing orders due to the covid-19 pandemic .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	furthermore , control communities may prematurely adopt components of the proposed intervention as they become widely available .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	these types of events induce confounding of the intervention effect by time .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	such confounding is a well - known limitation of swds ; a common approach to adjusting for it makes use of a mixed effects modeling framework that includes both fixed and random effects for time .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	however , these models have several shortcomings when multiple confounding factors are present .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	methods :
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	we discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mixed effects models in the context of proposed swds to investigate interventions intended to reduce mortality associated with the opioid epidemic , and propose solutions to accommodate deviations from assumptions that underlie these models .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	we conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from swd trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models under different sources of confounding .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	we specifically examine the impact of factors external to the study and premature adoption of intervention components .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	results :
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	when only external factors are present , our simulation studies show that commonly used mixed effects models can result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect , but have inflated type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	these models are severely biased when confounding factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters ; premature adoption of intervention components is an example of this scenario .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	in these scenarios , models that incorporate fixed intervention - by - time interaction terms and an unstructured covariance for the interventionby - cluster - by - time random effects result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect , reach nominal confidence interval coverage , and preserve type 1 error , but may reduce power .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	conclusions :
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	the incorporation of fixed and random time effects in mixed effects models require certain assumptions about the impact of confounding by time in swd .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	violations of these assumptions can result in severe bias of the intervention effect estimate , under coverage of confidence intervals , and inflated type 1 error .
da97e7bc9c4a1fd712146eafa42c3d95dc4131b6	since model choice has considerable impact on study power as well as validity of results , careful consideration needs to be given to choosing an appropriate model that takes into account potential confounding factors .

43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	the recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus and its rapid spread underlines the importance of understanding human mobility .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	enclosed spaces , such as public transport vehicles ( e.g. buses and trains ) , offer a suitable environment for infections to spread widely and quickly .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	investigating the movement patterns and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	for instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent in human mobility on disease spread , but has not considered other dimensions such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	here , we consider multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for the design of effective intervention strategies .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	we use one month of citywide smart card travel data collected in sydney , australia to classify bus passengers along three dimensions , namely the degree of exploration , the distance travelled and the number of encounters .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	additionally , we simulate disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	we investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	our results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different groups of passengers , that would remain hidden when considering only a single dimension .
43c1c036a0c58dfc3798b1b6cef702714cbdab0f	we also identify groups that are more influential than others given specific disease characteristics , which can guide containment and vaccination efforts .
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	this study empirically investigates the complex interplay between the severity of the coronavirus pandemic , mobility changes in retail and recreation , transit stations , workplaces , and residential areas , and lockdown measures in 88 countries of the word .
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	to conduct the study , data on mobility patterns , socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people , lockdown measures , and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources ( e.g. , google , undp , un , bbc , oxford university , worldometer ) .
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	a structural equation modeling ( sem ) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators .
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing .
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	however , pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice .
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	the results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity .
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	countries with a higher number of elderly people , employment in the service sector , and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic ( e.g. , usa , uk , italy , and spain ) .
bd4bf52ae4d21d9c269aba8caacb70c994645fa5	social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic .

afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	( cy / tbi ) regimen significantly improved prognosis after cord blood transplantation ( cbt ) for adult acute myelogenous leukemia ( aml ) and myelodysplastic syndrome ( mds ) .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	the efficacy of hdca in bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( bmt / pbsct ) , however , has not yet been elucidated .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	findings :
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	we conducted a cohort study to compare the prognosis of hdca / cy / tbi ( n = 435 ) and cy / tbi ( n = 1667 ) in bmt / pbsct for aml / mds using a japanese transplant registry database .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	the median age was 38 years , and 86.0 % of the patients had aml .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	unrelated donors comprised 54.6 % , and 63.9 % of donors were human leukocyte antigen ( hla)-matched .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	overall survival ( os ) was not improved in the hdca / cy / tbi group ( adjusted hazard ratio ( hr ) , 1.14 ; p = 0.13 ) .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	neutrophil engraftment was inferior ( hr , 0.80 ; p < 0.01 ) , and the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis and thrombotic microangiopathy increased in hdca / cy / tbi ( hr , 1.47 and 1.60 ; p = 0.06 and 0.04 , respectively ) , leading to significantly higher non - relapse mortality ( nrm ; hr , 1.48 ; p < 0.01 ) .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	post - transplant relapse and tumor - related mortality were not suppressed by the addition of hdca .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	conclusions :
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	this study indicated the inefficacy of hdca / cy / tbi in bmt / pbsct for aml / mds .
afabc35bb3e8013fd3fd54e767176744f5b36fc7	our results should be validated in large - scale prospective studies .

06d43134d3069227e19017b6e9e9744e15532d4d	-oligoadenylate and thus activation of endoribonuclease l. specific rna sequences and structural motifs can also enhance activation of oas1 through currently undefined mechanisms .
06d43134d3069227e19017b6e9e9744e15532d4d	to better understand these drivers of oas activation , we tested the impact of defined sequence changes within a short dsrna
06d43134d3069227e19017b6e9e9744e15532d4d	that strongly activates oas1 .

06d43134d3069227e19017b6e9e9744e15532d4d	consistent with this idea , we also find that the dsrna binding position is dictated by an established consensus sequence ( wwn 9 wg ) .
06d43134d3069227e19017b6e9e9744e15532d4d	unexpectedly , however , not all sequences fitting this consensus activate oas1 equivalently , with strong dependence on the identity of both partially conserved ( w ) and non - conserved ( n 9 ) residues .
06d43134d3069227e19017b6e9e9744e15532d4d	a picture thus emerges in which both specific rna features and the context in which they are presented dictate the ability of short dsrnas to activate oas1 .

a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	with the recent covid-19 pandemic , healthcare systems all over the world are struggling to manage the massive increase in emergency department ( ed ) visits .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	this has put an enormous demand on medical professionals .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	increased wait times in the ed increases the risk of infection transmission .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	in this work we present an open - source , low cost , off - body system to assist in the automatic triage of patients in the ed based on widely available hardware .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	the system initially focuses on two symptoms of the infection -fever and cyanosis .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	the use of visible and far - infrared cameras allows for rapid assessment at a 1 m distance , thus reducing the load on medical staff and lowering the risk of spreading the infection within hospitals .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	its utility can be extended to a general clinical setting in non - emergency times as well to reduce wait time , channel the time and effort of healthcare professionals to more critical tasks and also prioritize severe cases .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	our system consists of a raspberry pi 4 , a google coral usb accelerator , a raspberry pi camera v2 and a flir lepton 3.5 radiometry long - wave infrared camera with an associated io module .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	algorithms running in real - time detect the presence and body parts of individual(s ) in view , and segments out the forehead and lip regions using posenet .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	the temperature of the forehead - eye area is estimated from the infrared camera image and cyanosis is assessed from the image of the lips in the visible spectrum .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	in our preliminary experiments , an accuracy of 97 % was achieved for detecting fever and 77 % for the detection of cyanosis , with a sensitivity of 91 % and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	although preliminary results are promising , we note that the entire system needs to be optimized before use and assessed for efficacy .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	the use of low - cost instrumentation will not produce temperature readings and identification of cyanosis that is acceptable in many situations .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	for this reason , we are releasing the full code stack and system design to allow others to rapidly iterate and improve the system .
a8827a07e783bdbba69cd26c21f4211c8a960821	this may be of particular benefit in low - resource settings , and low - to - middle income countries in particular , which are just beginning to be affected by covid-19 .
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	we replaced the hiv-1 nucleocapsid ( nc ) domain with different n - coding sequences to test sars - cov nucleocapsid
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	( n ) self - interaction capacity , and determined the capabilities of each chimera to direct viruslike particle ( vlp ) assembly .
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	analysis results indicate that the replacement of nc with the carboxyl - terminal half of the sars - cov n resulted in the production of wild type ( wt)-level virus - like particles ( vlps ) with the density of a wt hiv-1 particle .
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	when co - expressed with sars - cov n , chimeras containing the n carboxyl - terminal half sequence efficiently packaged n.
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	however , the same was not true for the chimera bearing the n amino - terminal half sequence , despite its production of substantial amounts of vlps .
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	according to further analysis , hiv-1 nc replacement with n residues 2 - 213 , 215 - 421 , or 234 - 421 resulted in efficient vlp production at levels comparable to that of wt hiv-1 , but replacement with residues 215 - 359 , 302 - 421 , 2 - 168 , or 2 - 86 failed to restore vlp production to wildtype levels .
5943d40911e2da61381868d783fa205c57cd8de3	the results suggest that the domain conferring the ability to direct vlp assembly and release in sars - cov n is largely contained between residues 168 and 421 .
3ebe9c3e3c98862d33e635bd0302513a2072c71a	chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine are primarily known as antimalaria drugs .
3ebe9c3e3c98862d33e635bd0302513a2072c71a	here , we investigate the influence of hydration water on the molecular dynamics in hydroxychloroquine sulfate , a commonly used solubilized drug form .
3ebe9c3e3c98862d33e635bd0302513a2072c71a	when hydration , even at a low level , results in a disordered structure , as opposed to the highly ordered structure of dry hydroxychloroquine sulfate , the activation barriers for the rotation of methyl groups in the drug molecules become randomized and , on average , significantly reduced .
3ebe9c3e3c98862d33e635bd0302513a2072c71a	the facilitated stochastic motions of the methyl groups may benefit the biomolecular activity due to the more efficient sampling of the energy landscape in the disordered hydration environment experienced by the drug molecules in vivo .

a7c903a88894a0e40d3b9266d4004f782a48c60f	the covid-19 pandemic has dramatically increased food insecurity in the united states ( us ) .
a7c903a88894a0e40d3b9266d4004f782a48c60f	the objective of this study was to understand the early effects of the covid-19 pandemic among low - income adults in the us as social distancing measures began to be implemented .
a7c903a88894a0e40d3b9266d4004f782a48c60f	on 19 - 24 march 2020 we fielded a national , web - based survey ( 53 % response rate ) among adults with < 250 % of the federal poverty line in the us ( n = 1478 ) .
a7c903a88894a0e40d3b9266d4004f782a48c60f	measures included household food security status and covid-19-related basic needs challenges .
a7c903a88894a0e40d3b9266d4004f782a48c60f	overall , 36 % of low - income adults in the us were food secure , 20 % had marginal food security , and 44 % were food insecure .

9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	for black women and birthing people , endemic vulnerabilities and disparities may exacerbate deleterious covid-19 impacts .
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	historical and ongoing macro - level policies and forces over time have induced disproportionately higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality among black women and birthing people , and contemporary macroeconomic and healthcare policies and factors continue to hold particular consequence .
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	these factors induce detrimental psychological , health , and behavioral responses that contribute to maternal health disparities .
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	the covid-19 pandemic is likely to disproportionately impact black women and birthing people , as policy responses have failed to account for the their unique socioeconomic and healthcare contexts .
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	the resulting consequences may form a ' vicious cycle ' , with upstream impacts that exacerbate upstream macro - level policies and forces that can further perpetuate the clustering of maternal morbidity and mortality in this population .
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	understanding the impacts of covid-19 among black women and birthing people requires theoretical frameworks that can sufficiently conceptualize their multi - level , interacting , and dynamic nature .
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	thus , we advocate for the proliferation of syndemic perspectives to guide maternal disparities research and prevention during the covid-19 pandemic .
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	these perspectives can enable a holistic and nuanced understanding of the intersection of endemic and covid-19-specific vulnerabilities and disparities experienced by black women and birthing people .
9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	syndemic - informed research can then lead to impactful multi - level prevention strategies that simultaneously tackle both endemic and covid-19-specific factors and outcomes that lead to the clustering of vulnerabilities and disparities over time .

9feab9dcb8d7f58728e9e37f485f3efc4c2f6666	emerging evidence suggests that the covid-19 pandemic and related policies have exacerbated racial maternal health disparities and worsened black maternal health .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	infectious disease outbreaks often have consequences beyond human health , including concern among the population , economic instability , and sometimes violence .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	a warning system capable of anticipating social disruptions resulting from disease outbreaks is urgently needed to help decision makers prepare appropriately .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	we designed a system that operates in near real - time to identify and predict social response .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	over 150,000 internet - based news articles related to outbreaks of 16 diseases in 72 countries and territories were provided by healthmap .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	these articles were automatically tagged with indicators of the disease activity and population reaction .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	an anomaly detection algorithm was implemented on the population reaction indicators to identify periods of unusually severe social response .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	then a model was developed to predict the probability of these periods of unusually severe social response occurring in the coming week , 2 and 3 weeks .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	this model exhibited remarkably strong performance for diseases with substantial media coverage .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	for country - disease pairs with a median of 20 or more articles per year , the onset of social response in the next week was correctly predicted over 60 % of the time , and 87 % of weeks were correctly predicted .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	performance was weaker for diseases with little media coverage , and , for these diseases , the main utility of our system is in identifying social response when it occurs , rather than predicting when it will happen in the future .
e977ca94d7eb88b4b650c25c3543e9d48afd535b	overall , the developed near real - time prediction approach is a promising step toward developing predictive models to inform responders of the likely social consequences of disease spread .

7bd6421206f7ff61993a361896c3ffc02e3d7f51	real - world datasets often contain many missing values due to several reasons .
7bd6421206f7ff61993a361896c3ffc02e3d7f51	this is usually an issue since many learning algorithms require complete datasets .
7bd6421206f7ff61993a361896c3ffc02e3d7f51	in certain cases , there are constraints in the real world problem that create difficulties in continuously observing all data .
7bd6421206f7ff61993a361896c3ffc02e3d7f51	in this paper , we investigate if graphical causal models can be used to impute missing values and derive additional information on the uncertainty of the imputed values .
7bd6421206f7ff61993a361896c3ffc02e3d7f51	our goal is to use the information from a complete dataset in the form of graphical causal models to impute missing values in an incomplete dataset .
7bd6421206f7ff61993a361896c3ffc02e3d7f51	this assumes that the datasets have the same data generating process .
7bd6421206f7ff61993a361896c3ffc02e3d7f51	furthermore , we calculate the probability of each missing data value belonging to a specified percentile .

37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	two recent studies have suggested a link between the bcg vaccination policy and the morbidity and mortality due to covid-19 .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	in the present study we compared the impact of covid-19 in terms of case fatality rates ( cfr ) between countries with high disease burden and those with bcg revaccination policies presuming that revaccination practices would have provided added protection to the population against severe covid-19 .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	we found a significant difference in the cfr between the two groups of countries .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	our data further supports the view that universal bcg vaccination has a protective effect on the course of covid-19 probably preventing progression to severe disease and death .
37e5753fd6b2deded4b08c8fae7adf52b3154af0	clinical trials of bcg vaccine are urgently needed to establish its beneficial role in covid-19 as suggested by the epidemiological data , especially in countries without a universal bcg vaccination policy .
eb7ed9704b8aca731653e08d7a790c84f4352f37	posttranslational modifications are increasingly recognized as key strategies used by bacterial and viral pathogens to modulate host factors critical for infection .
eb7ed9704b8aca731653e08d7a790c84f4352f37	a number of recent studies illustrate how pathogens use these posttranslational modifications to target central signaling pathways in the host cell , such as the nf - kb and map kinase pathways , which are essential for pathogens ' replication , propagation , and evasion from host immune responses .

46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	the emergence of the highly pathogenic sars coronavirus ( sars - cov ) has reignited interest in coronavirus biology and pathogenesis .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	an emerging theme in coronavirus pathogenesis is that the interaction between specific viral genes and the host immune system , specifically the innate immune system , functions as a key determinant in regulating virulence and disease outcomes .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	using sars - cov as a model , we will review the current knowledge of the interplay between coronavirus infection and the host innate immune system in vivo , and then discuss the mechanisms by which specific gene products antagonize the host innate immune response in cell culture models .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	our data suggests that the sars - cov uses specific strategies to evade and antagonize the sensing and signaling arms of the interferon pathway .
46decd956d74e9db8e5c0f023b554015a7d8f0af	we summarize by identifying future points of consideration that will contribute greatly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing coronavirus pathogenesis and virulence , and the development of severe disease in humans and animals .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is a novel coronavirus strain disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	( sars - cov-2 ) .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	the disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16 % of hospitalized cases .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	the admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of covid-19 include severe hypoxia , low platelet count , elevated bilirubin , hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	these symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	the diseases also share similar comorbidity risks including dementia , type 2 diabetes mellitus , coronary heart disease , hypertension and chronic renal failure .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	sepsis has been observed in up to 59 % of hospitalized covid-19 patients .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	it is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy / drug repurposing avenues for late - stage severe covid-19 patients .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	this would enable better protection of at - risk populations and clinical stratification of covid-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	as there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed covid-19 patients correlating their genomic profile , disease severity and outcome , co - morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors ( such as ethnicity , blood group , smoking , bmi etc . ) , a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	we therefore ran a study on the uk biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes , and correlated these with covid-19 patients .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	sepsis is itself a life - threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20 % .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	like the initial studies for covid-19 patients , standard genome wide association studies ( gwas ) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	we used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from uk biobank .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	we identified 70 sepsis risk - associated genes , which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction , pi3k / mtor pathway signaling , immune response regulation , aberrant gaba and neurogenic signaling .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	this study has identified 70 sepsis related genes , many of them for the first time , that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe covid-19 patients .
29ac388383ff694ee2ec497abce2958eb1fc382f	we have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe covid-19 .

a58babc187608d204e7237eceb4daa6e8f9f0fb4	from these results we conclude that in sy1s agn winds are triggered by higher accretion rates and probably radiatively launched , and there is no clear evidence of an effect on the star formation .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	recent epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of hand , foot , and mouth disease ( hfmd ) , which can be categorized according to its clinical symptoms as typical or atypical , have markedly increased worldwide .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	a primary causative agent for typical hfmd outbreaks , enterovirus 71
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	( ev71 ) , has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in s phase for own replication ; however , it is not clear whether coxsackievirus ( cva6 ) , the main agent for atypical hfmd , also regulates the host cell cycle .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	in this study , we demonstrate for the first time that cva6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in g0 / g1-phase .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	furthermore , synchronization in g0 / g1 phase , but not s phase or g2 / m phase , promotes viral production .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	to investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by cva6 infection , we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at g0 / g1 or g2 /
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	m. our results demonstrate that cva6 infection promotes g0 / g1 phase entry from g2 / m phase , and inhibits g0 / g1 exit into s phase .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	in line with its role to arrest cells in g0 / g1 phase , the expression of cyclind1 , cdk4 , cycline1 , cdk2 , cyclinb1 , cdk1 , p53 , p21 , and p16 is regulated by cva6 .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	finally , the non - structural proteins of cva6 , rna - dependent rna polymerase 3d and protease 3c , are demonstrated to be responsible for the g0 / g1-phase arrest .
41109a7485f8648bc39545c38aa0dea1e8460f17	these findings suggest that cva6 infection arrested cell cycle in g0 / g1-phase via non - structural proteins 3d and 3c , which may provide favorable environments for virus production .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	the 3c - like main peptidase 3cl pro is a viral polyprotein processing enzyme essential for the viability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	while it is generalized that 3cl pro and the structurally related 3c pro viral peptidases cleave their substrates via a mechanism similar to that underlying the peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin - like serine proteinases ( clsps ) , some of the hypothesized key intermediates have not been structurally characterized .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	here , we present three crystal structures of sars 3cl pro in complex with each of two members of a new class of peptide - based phthalhydrazide inhibitors .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	both inhibitors form an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of cys145 , trapping the enzyme 's catalytic residues in configurations similar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis of native substrates .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	most significantly , our crystallographic data are consistent with a scenario in which a water molecule , possibly via indirect coordination from the carbonyl oxygen of thr26 , has initiated nucleophilic attack on the enzyme - bound inhibitor .
691e4cbb40e45f5174902fe4a30d47cb5550f4a7	our data suggest that this structure resembles that of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate during the deacylation step of normal peptidyl cleavage .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	a large percentage of the deaths from covid-19 occur among residents of long - term care facilities .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	first , the structural features of such settings may lead to death .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	alternatively , it is possible that individuals in these facilities are in poorer health than those living elsewhere , and that these individuals would have died even if they had not been in these facilities .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	our findings show that , controlling for the population density , the percentage of older adults in the population , and the number of hospital beds per capita , there is a significant positive association between the number of long - term care beds ( ltcb ) per capita and covid-19 mortality rates .
071c7c770edcfcfdedba87de690b305dae29c13e	this finding provides support for the claim that long - term care living arrangements ( of older people ) are a significant risk factor for dying from covid-19 .
797d4bc91a5889c5fbcd4a51cbd1459fe277fe58	intracranial inoculation of immunocompetent mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( lcmv ) induces a fatal neurologic illness .

797d4bc91a5889c5fbcd4a51cbd1459fe277fe58	immunosuppression prevented mhc induction .
797d4bc91a5889c5fbcd4a51cbd1459fe277fe58	mice inoculated at birth had persistent infections , with lcmv antigens found primarily in neurons , but no inflammatory cells or focal increase in mhc class i. failure of infected neurons to express mhc class i allows them to escape destruction by cytotoxic t cells ( ctl ) but may increase their susceptibility to be persistently infected by non - lytic viruses .
d6bbcc059331dda0ac8c4a897f4d7171d0d1cb99	to substantiate psychological symptoms following humidifier disinfectant ( hd ) disasters , counseling records of 26 victims and 92 family members of victims ( 45 were bereaved ) were analyzed retrospectively .
d6bbcc059331dda0ac8c4a897f4d7171d0d1cb99	among the victims , 34.6 % had clinical global impression - severity scores of over 4 , which meant they were moderately ill .
d6bbcc059331dda0ac8c4a897f4d7171d0d1cb99	while anxiety / fear and depression with respiratory symptoms were frequently observed in victims and family members , chronic psychological distress such as alcohol / smoking abuse and insomnia was relatively high in bereaved family members .
d6bbcc059331dda0ac8c4a897f4d7171d0d1cb99	in conclusion , it is important to provide mental health support for victims and their families , focusing on the characteristic symptoms of each group as well as monetary compensation .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	in this manuscript we propose a method for pricing insurance products that cover not only traditional risks , but also unforeseen ones .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	by considering the poisson process parameter to be a mixed random variable , we capture the heterogeneity of foreseeable and unforeseeable risks .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	to illustrate , we estimate the weights for the two risk streams for a real dataset from a portuguese insurer .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	to calculate the premium , we set the frequency and severity as distributions that belong to the linear exponential family .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	under a bayesian set - up , we show that when working with a finite mixture of conjugate priors , the premium can be estimated by a mixture of posterior means , with updated parameters , depending on claim histories .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	we emphasise the riskiness of the unforeseeable trend , by choosing heavy - tailed distributions .
8b47616b03d6bb9f1d79944e438e14fb2cea15d5	after estimating distribution parameters involved using the expectation - maximization algorithm , we found that bayesian premiums derived are more reactive to claim trends than traditional ones .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	the effect of anaesthetic gases given via laryngeal mask on nasal ciliary beat pattern and frequency has not been studied .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	anaesthetic gases such as iso¯urane , halothane and en¯urane are known to reduce ciliary beat frequency , but it is unknown whether they also cause cilia to beat in a dyskinetic fashion .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	brush biopsies of nasal mucosa were taken pre - and post - anaesthesia with iso¯urane , given via a laryngeal mask , from patients undergoing nasal surgery .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	the samples were observed by light microscopy , and high - speed digital video recordings were made to determine ciliary beat frequency .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	using slow - motion playback , the ciliary beat pattern was scored for dysmotility , and the proportion of immotile cilia in the sample was determined .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	we found that ciliary beat frequency decreased signi ® cantly ( p < 0.01 ) after exposure to iso¯urane (
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	10.24 hz compared to 9.20 hz ) .
b6579010c8f85f0060d6102729df6fada50fe45e	however , iso¯urane did not alter the ciliary beat pattern or the proportion of immotile cilia .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	protein ubiquitination is a highly conserved post - translational modification affecting various biological processes including viral propagation .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	ubiquitination has multiple effects on viral propagation , including viral genome uncoating , viral replication , and immune evasion .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	ubiquitination of viral proteins is triggered by the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( ups ) .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	this involves the covalent attachment of the highly conserved 76 amino acid residue ubiquitin protein to target proteins by the consecutive actions of e1 , e2 and e3 enzymes , and the 26s proteasome that together form a multiprotein complex that degrades target proteins .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	the ups is the primary cytosolic proteolytic machinery for the selective degradation of various forms of proteins including viral proteins , thereby limiting viral growth in host cells .
95d699a680efeea93de467496b23eed470998d95	to combat this host anti - viral machinery , viruses have evolved the ability to employ or subvert the ups to inactivate or degrade cellular proteins to favour viral propagation .

6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	this paper describes the increasing role of ontologies in the context of grid computing for obtaining , comparing and analyzing distributed heterogeneous scientific data .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	in the communities of people committed to a common goal , the management of resources and services becomes very important .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	we chose the application domain of human disease research and control .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	a characteristic of the domain is that trusted databases exist but their schemas are often poorly or not documented .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	the network of biomedical databases forms a loose federation of autonomous , distributed , heterogeneous data repositories ripe for information integration .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	grid services will provide a dynamic way to use resources in such a large distributed scientific environment while the use of ontology enables the system to carryout reasoning at 3 levels : a ) available information in all bio - databases ( grid nodes ) worldwide

6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	we adopted the ontology design methodology of dogma and developed generic human disease ontology ( gendo ) that contains common general information regarding human diseases .

6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	( a ) disease types , ( b ) causes ( c ) symptoms and ( d ) treatments .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	we illustrate how this gendo helps to produce specific human disease ontologies ( spedo ) on request .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	we show how the combination of two different but complementary techniques , namely grid computing and ontology , results in a dynamic and intelligent information system .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	the two approaches together , being complementary , enable the system as a whole .
6f639215a40138970f8fd6c2d19cbe9baad7da90	recent developments in integrating parallel and distributed computing , combined with improvements in overall network bandwidth have made it possible to add a new dimension to distributed computing : the grid .

3d921c03dc23ee850655ddfd9d5ebe3956d70bf8	fifty - six studies encompassing 4 095 cases were included in this meta - analysis .
3d921c03dc23ee850655ddfd9d5ebe3956d70bf8	the estimated median incubation period for general transmissions was 5.8 days [ 95 % confidence interval ( 95%ci ) , 5.3 to 6.2 d ] .

107f0d5a47f48f85d6645cac0e7008edc4d9d8cd	here , we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two puerto rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses .
107f0d5a47f48f85d6645cac0e7008edc4d9d8cd	using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm , we categorized herpesviruses into 41 otus , representing approximately 80 % of all herpesviruses in the host community .
107f0d5a47f48f85d6645cac0e7008edc4d9d8cd	although 13 otus were detected in multiple host species , otus generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined .

9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	cd200 , a type i membrane glycoprotein , plays an important role in prevention of inflammatory disorders , graft rejection , autoimmune diseases and spontaneous fetal loss .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	it also regulates tumor immunity .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	a truncated cd200 ( cd200 tr ) resulting from alternative splicing has been identified and characterized as a functional antagonist to full - length cd200 .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	thus , it is important to explore the mechanism(s ) controlling alternative splicing of cd200 .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	in this study , we identified an exonic splicing enhancer ( ese ) located in exon 2 , which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein sf2/ asf .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	deletion or mutation of the ese site decreased expression of the full - length cd200 .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	direct binding of sf2 / asf to the ese site was confirmed by rna electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	knockdown of expression of sf2 / asf resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ese , whereas overexpression of sf2 / asf increased expression of the full - length cd200 .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	in vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of cd200 with increased expression of sf2 / asf and the full - length cd200 .
9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863	taken together , our data suggest for the first time that sf2 / asf regulates the function of cd200 by controlling cd200 alternative splicing , through direct binding to an ese located in exon 2 of cd200 .

354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	covid-19 is an extremely infectious disease with a relatively large virus incubation period in the affected people who may be asymptomatic .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	therefore , to reduce the transmission of this pathogen , several countries have taken many intervention measures .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	in this paper , we show that the impact of these measures in india is different from several other countries .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	it is shown that an early lockdown in late march 2020 changed the initial exponential growth curve of covid-19 to a linear one , but a surge in the number of cases from late april 2020 brought india back to a quadratic trajectory .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	a regional analysis shows the disparate impact of the intervention in different states .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	it is further shown that the number of reported infections correlates with the number of tests , and therefore regions with limited diagnostics resources may not have a realistic estimate of the virus spread .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	this insufficiency of diagnostic test data is also reflected in an increasing positivity rate for india nearly 2.5 months after the lockdown , inconsistent with the trends observed for other geographical regions .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	nonetheless , future projections are made using different epidemiological models based on the available data , and a comparative study is presented .
354ccca1a3cdbe8bb707fda2d4987eaecc81326d	in the absence of a reliable estimate of the true number of infections , these projections will have a limited accuracy : with that limitation , the most optimistic prediction suggests a continuing virus transmission through september 2020 .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	wide heterogeneity of disease course ranging from asymptomatic spread 1 , 2 to respiratory failure and death 3 , 4 has become a hallmark of the sars - cov-2 ( covid-19 ) pandemic .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	while this clinical spectrum is well documented , its immunologic underpinnings are less clear .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	we have therefore initiated studies of the b cell responses as they would participate in both early effector responses and in the initiation of memory formation .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	in terms of effector responses , we were particularly interested in the engagement and clinical correlates of the extra - follicular pathway ( ef )
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	we recently described in flaring sle 5 .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	in this systemic autoimmune disease , the ef pathway is initiated by newly activated naïve b cell ( an ) leading to large expansion of autoantibody - producing antibody - secreting cells through the generation of an epigenetically primed b cell precursor which are double negative ( dn ) for naïve ( igd ) and memory markers ( cd27 ) and
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	lacking expression of cxcr5 and cd21 ( dn2 ) 6 , 7 , 8 .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	these highly activated d2 cells are also distinguished by high expression of cd11c and t - bet and are tlr7-driven .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	both tlr7-stimulation which is triggered by ssrna
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	and the central role played by their murine counterparts ( typically characterized as age - associated b cells ) , in viral clearance , strongly supported the hypothesis that dn2 cells and the global ef pathway could be prominently engaged in covid-19 patients 9 .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	also of note , ef b cell activation is particularly prominent in sle patients of african - american ancestry , a population disproportionately represented in severe covid-19 6 , 9 .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	in this study we find that critically ill patients with covid-19 robustly upregulate b cells within the extrafollicular pathway , produce enormous numbers of antibody secreting cells , and lose unique transitional b cell populations that correlate with positive prognosis .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	this patient cluster associates tightly with biomarkers of poor outcomes and exhibits high rates of mortality .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	thus , this b cell phenotype might serve as an immunological marker of severe covid-19 infection at early stages and could therefore identify a patient subset likely to benefit from targeted immunomodulatory therapy aimed at alleviating disease burden .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	:
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	medrxiv preprint 3 of covid-19 + patient ascs revealed a significant increase over healthy controls ( fig 1d ) , and substantial asc maturation as indicated by high expression of the plasma cell marker cd138 ( fig 1e ) .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	counterintuitively , while asc generation and maturation are often correlates of protection in vaccine responses 22 , in patients with covid-19 increased asc instead portended negative disease outcomes with icu - admitted patients presenting with significantly more ascs than their hd and outpatient counterparts ( fig 1f ) .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	closer examination of the initial clustering separated the covid-19 + patients into two distinct clusters .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	by removing the healthy donors and re - clustering , two groups of covid-19 patients resulted with strong upregulation of the ef response pathway ( ef - cov ) , and those with a muted ef response but enhanced transitional b cell signal ( tr - cov ) ( fig 2a ) .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	this was not a reflection of infection duration as both clusters were sampled at similar times post symptom onset ( fig 2b ) .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	re - assessment of asc expansion revealed significantly higher frequencies in the ef - cov cluster , averaging > 10 % of cd19 + b cells -well above frequencies after robust vaccine responses that include quadrivalent influenza virus , hepatitis a , tetanus toxoid , and yellow fever vaccines ( fig 2c ) .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	enriched asc maturation , and increases in the an and dn2 b cell compartments also correlated with asc expansion within the ef - cov cluster , but not in the tr - cov cluster or healthy donors (
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	fig    2d - e ) .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	surprisingly , the composition of the dn compartment , a key indicator of ef response skewing , appeared almost identical to patients with active sle in the replacement of the switch - memory ( sm ) associated dn1 population with the asc - associated dn2 subset ( fig 2f - h ) .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	ef response characterization has identified the pathway as peripherally focused , inflammatory , and highly associated with il-6 and ip-10 23 , 24 .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	indeed , chemokine receptor analysis of ef populations showed a significant decrease in central homing predisposition ( cd62l , cxcr5 ) ( fig 2i ) .
dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	instead , cxcr3 expression across the subsets , coupled with increased levels of ip-10 within the plasma of the ef - cov cluster is highly suggestive of peripheral homing to inflamed tissue sites as described in both lung 25 and kidney 26

dd2356de0eb734266de56312eff7524fa3b70868	indeed , the two highest cytokine correlates of the ef pathway , ip-10 and il-6 23 , 24 , are strongly upregulated in ef - cov cluster and reflect the associations with poor outcome prognosis in emerging sars - cov-2 literature 27 , 28

ba67fce2eafcacf3a4b97bc1e74d0d3037f01ba4	understanding concurrent and parallel programming can be a very hard task on first contact by students .
ba67fce2eafcacf3a4b97bc1e74d0d3037f01ba4	this paper describes the development and experimental results of the fsp2java tool .
ba67fce2eafcacf3a4b97bc1e74d0d3037f01ba4	the proposed method starts from concurrent systems modeling through finite state processes ( fsp ) .
ba67fce2eafcacf3a4b97bc1e74d0d3037f01ba4	after that , the method includes an automatic code generation from the model .
ba67fce2eafcacf3a4b97bc1e74d0d3037f01ba4	this goal is achieved by a domainspecific language compiler which translates from the fsp model to java code .
ba67fce2eafcacf3a4b97bc1e74d0d3037f01ba4	the fsp2java tool is available for free download in the github site .
ba67fce2eafcacf3a4b97bc1e74d0d3037f01ba4	we argue that this tool helps in teaching concurrent systems , since it abstracts all complex languages concern and encourages the student to be focused at the fundamental concepts of modeling and analysis .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	pure solitons are for the first time distilled from the resonant continuous wave ( cw ) background in a fiber laser by utilizing nonlinear fourier transform ( nft ) .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	it is identified that the soliton and the resonant cw background have different eigenvalue distributions in the nonlinear frequency domain .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	similar to water distillation , we propose the approach of soliton distillation , by making nft on a steady pulse generated from a fiber laser , then filtering out the eigenvalues of the resonant cw background in the nonlinear frequency domain , and finally recovering the soliton by inverse nft ( inft ) .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	simulation results verify that the soliton can be distinguished from the resonant cw background in the nonlinear frequency domain and pure solitons can be obtained by inft .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	the term ' soliton ' refers to the localized solution of integral nonlinear systems [ 1 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	solitons are the balanced product of diffraction and nonlinearity , where they can propagate without distortion in the medium .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	in optics , solitons can be generated by a cancellation of nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	due to the anomalous dispersion of fiber , the existence of solitons in optical fibers was theoretically predicted [ 2 ] and experimentally verified [ 3 ] , which greatly promoted the exploration of solitons in nonlinear systems .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	due to the natural information representor of " 1 " for binary communication , ultrashort pulse duration and distortion - less transmission , solitons are considered as a perfect candidate for high - speed telecommunications in fiber optical transmissions [ 4 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	strictly speaking , solitons only exist in conservative systems , for example , a system that can be governed by the nonlinear schrödinger equation ( nlse ) .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	with a loose definition , ultrashort pulses generated in a fiber laser can be considered as solitons , since the pulse repeats itself at a fixed position in the fiber laser under the condition of steady state .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	solitons generated in fiber lasers can be considered as an averaged soliton when all cavity parameters are distributed [ 5 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	to achieve soliton generation in fiber lasers , various passive mode - locking techniques are applied [ 6][7][8 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	different from pulse propagation in a fiber where the system is conservative under the assumption of propagation without loss , a fiber laser is a dissipative system where gain and loss affect the pulse generation while simultaneously it is a periodic boundary system .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	independent of detailed mode - locking mechanism , solitons generated in fiber lasers experience periodical disturbances , such as gain and loss , and release the excess energy as dispersive waves .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	if the phase difference between the soliton and the dispersive wave is multiples of 2 , they will interfere with each other and kelly sidebands will symmetrically appear on the spectrum [ 9 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	in addition , incoherent sidebands may appear on the spectrum too [ 10 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	here , both kelly sidebands and incoherent sidebands are collectively referred to the resonant continuous wave ( cw ) background .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	as kelly sidebands coherently interfere with solitons , it is challenging to get rid of them .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	people always used an external spectral filter to filter out the cw component before amplifying the soliton for specific applications [ 11 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	however , spectral filtering simultaneously changes solitons .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	so far , no method has been proposed to separate solitons from the parasitic resonant cw background .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	alternatively , people prefer to use the appearance of kelly sidebands as a criterion to verify the generation of soliton [ 12,13 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	the true optical spectrum of a pure soliton generated from a fiber laser is so far unknown .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	it is interesting to know the details of a pure soliton , instead of a composite of a soliton and the resonant cw background .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	the coherent and incoherent spectral sidebands of the composite spectrum have been identified by using the dispersive fourier transform ( dft ) technique [ 10 ] .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	to separate a soliton from the mixture of solitons and the resonant cw background from a fiber laser can answer a fundamental distress that what is the real difference between a soliton from a conservative system and a dissipative system .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	the implementation of pure solitons would also rule out background induced soliton interaction [ 14 ] , which will greatly simplify analysis of soliton interaction in nonlinear systems .
fd817b9b3a62207308e3708fe91b16e63cc889d4	recently , an elegant method of nonlinear fourier transform ( nft ) has attracted worldwide research interests [ 15 ] , which can
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	a phenomenological approach is proposed to monitor the propagation of the covid-19pandemic first waves .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	a large set of data collected at a worldwide scale during the first months of 2020 is compiled into series of semi - logarithmic plots , for a selection of thirty - two countries from the five continents .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	three regimes are identified in the propagation of an epidemic wave : a pre - epidemic regime 1 , an exponential - growth regime 2 , and a resorption regime 3 .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	a two - parameters scaling of the first - wave death variation reported in china is used to fit those reported in other countries .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	comparison is made between the propagation of the pandemic in different countries , which are classified in four groups , from group a where the pandemic first waves were contained efficiently , to group d where the pandemic first waves widely spread .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	group a is mainly composed of asian countries , where fast and efficient measures have been applied .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	group d is composed of western - europe countries and the united states of america , where late decisions and confused political communication ( pandemic seriousness , protection masks , herd immunity etc . ) led to significant death tolls .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	the threat of large resurging epidemic waves after a hasty lockdown lift is discussed , in particular for the countries from group d , where the number of contagious people remained high in the beginning of may 2020 .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	the situation is opposite in asian countries from group a , where the number of contagious people was successfully maintained to a low level .
266f580bb8429905fc510933e435e957bb90875f	in particular , the results obtained by hong kong and south korea are highlighted , and the measures taken there are presented as virtuous examples that other countries may follow .

90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	the sample is generated cross - sectionally , but can also be thought of as survival data .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	each fit test provides interval censored information : masks observed to fail a fit test at time t failed at some point in ( 0 , t ) ( masks are assumed to have been initially functional ) .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	masks that pass the fit test fail some time in the future ( t , t max ) .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	for survival analysis we assume that each mask is independent with failure hazard from from a common distribution .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	our parametric survival model fits a 3-parameter generalized gamma hazard to the interval censored data .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	non - parametric or semi - parametric estimators which do not assume a functional form of the hazard are common in traditional survival analysis , and are available for interval censored data as well .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	however , nonparametric estimates ( npmle ) for interval censored data are not unique ; in some regions any baseline hazard matching continuity requirements is equally supported by the data .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	confidence intervals for interval censored baseline hazards are an active area of research

90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	several semi - parametric methods have recently been shown to have n 1 2 convergence with gaussian asymptotics making them amenable to bootstrapping ( wang et al .

90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	proportional hazards regression was used to model factors other than duration of use in this framework .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	modeling the data as cross - sectional observations of fit passing versus failure as a function of time is also supportable because no participant - mask pair is observed more than once
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	and there is minimal information to support extrapolation from before the earliest test time .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	because only a very small number of individuals are tested on more than one mask , we do not model or adjust for participant effects .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	integrated b - splines and constrained step functions allow modeling the failure log - odds as a monotone increasing function of time in a traditional logistic regression analysis .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	this approach yields much better studied statistical behavior ; however , given the modest sample size the probability statements produced should be taken as approximate .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	the cross - sectional model does not encode any behavior before the earliest test time ( e.g. that all masks initially fit ) .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	we found that the cross - sectional model and non - parametric and semi - parametric survival models yield essentially identical point estimates when tuned appropriately , which is anticipated based on the use of step functions and splines to model the baseline hazard in the survival routines .
90cf5680ea5db375c477825298d41c2c10cc4472	factors beyond use duration were analyzed with proportional hazards regression ( interval survival ) or logistic regression ( cross sectional ) .

4b4c8d31ce1d963ed055dbf0864758ea16762a11	although there is a significant amount of literature that deals with the identification of plant viral proteins involved in membrane remodeling and vesicle production in infected cells , there are very few investigations that report on the impact that infection has on the overall architecture and dynamics of the early secretory endomembranes .
4b4c8d31ce1d963ed055dbf0864758ea16762a11	recent investigations have shown that for some viruses the endoplasmic reticulum , golgi bodies and other organelles are heavily recruited into virusinduced perinuclear structures .
4b4c8d31ce1d963ed055dbf0864758ea16762a11	these structures are not isolated organelles and are dynamically connected to the bulk of non - modified endomembranes .
4b4c8d31ce1d963ed055dbf0864758ea16762a11	they also have a functional link with peripheral motile vesicles involved in virus intracellular movement .
4b4c8d31ce1d963ed055dbf0864758ea16762a11	the full molecular events that consubstantiate with this endomembrane recruitment in virus - induced structures remain to be elucidated but viral genome replication and virion assembly are probably taking place within these structures .

c9a781f7dbf01a37e830ce4571391ea706aa298e	this chemotype is very rare and is derived from cyclization of a geranyl group with a phenol functionality .
c9a781f7dbf01a37e830ce4571391ea706aa298e	most compounds ( 1 - 12 ) inhibited plpro in a dose dependent manner with ic 50 's raging between 5.0 and 14.4 lm.
c9a781f7dbf01a37e830ce4571391ea706aa298e	all new compounds having the dihydro-2h - pyran group showed better inhibition than their parent compounds ( 1 vs 11 , 2 vs 9 , 4 vs 12 , 5 vs 6 ) .

59961d3a878ffd53e8c7b55b941b94f1d82f97e2	results from cross - sectional and cohort studies show that asthma starts in childhood in a large proportion of cases .
59961d3a878ffd53e8c7b55b941b94f1d82f97e2	a proper diagnosis is easier to make in adults and school - age children , as permanent changes in lung development , the strong impact of environmental factors on the airways , the immunologic maturity process , and the use of some diagnostic tools make asthma more difficult to diagnose in preschool children .
59961d3a878ffd53e8c7b55b941b94f1d82f97e2	this period of a child 's life is an interesting challenge for pediatricians and specialists .
59961d3a878ffd53e8c7b55b941b94f1d82f97e2	the aim of the present review is to analyze the current knowledge regarding making an early and accurate asthma diagnosis and therefore deciding on the correct treatment to gain control over asthma symptoms and minimize health risks .
49d38b24e73f9fc1e483f13ca5b9cbfc298fcd95	camels are livestock that exhibit unique morphological , biochemical , and behavioral traits , which arose by natural and artificial selection .
49d38b24e73f9fc1e483f13ca5b9cbfc298fcd95	investigating the molecular basis of camel traits has been limited by :
49d38b24e73f9fc1e483f13ca5b9cbfc298fcd95	( 1 ) the absence of a comprehensive record of morphological trait variation ( e.g. , diseases ) and the associated mode of inheritance , ( 2 ) the lack of extended pedigrees of specific trait(s ) , and ( 3 ) the long reproductive cycle of the camel , which makes the cost of establishing and maintaining a breeding colony ( i.e. , monitoring crosses )
49d38b24e73f9fc1e483f13ca5b9cbfc298fcd95	prohibitively high .
49d38b24e73f9fc1e483f13ca5b9cbfc298fcd95	overcoming these challenges requires ( 1 ) detailed documentation of phenotypes / genetic diseases and their likely mode of inheritance ( and collection of related dna samples ) ,
49d38b24e73f9fc1e483f13ca5b9cbfc298fcd95	( 2 ) conducting association studies to identify phenotypes / genetic diseases causing genetic variants ( instead of classical linkage analysis , which requires extended pedigrees ) , and ( 3 ) validating likely causative variants by screening a large number of camel samples from different populations .

aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	microbiome - host interactions play significant roles in health and in various diseases including autoimmune disorders .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	uncovering these inter - kingdom cross - talks propels our understanding of disease pathogenesis and provides useful leads on potential therapeutic targets .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	despite the biological significance of microbe - host interactions , there is a big gap in understanding the downstream effects of these interactions on host processes .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	computational methods are expected to fill this gap by generating , integrating , and prioritizing predictions - as experimental detection remains challenging due to feasibility issues .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	here , we present microbiolink , a computational pipeline to integrate predicted interactions between microbial and host proteins together with host molecular networks .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	using the concept of network diffusion , microbiolink can analyse how microbial proteins in a certain context are influencing cellular processes by modulating gene or protein expression .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	we demonstrated the applicability of the pipeline using a case study .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	we used gut metaproteomic data from crohn 's disease patients and healthy controls to uncover the mechanisms by which the microbial proteins can modulate host genes which belong to biological processes implicated in disease pathogenesis .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	microbiolink , which is agnostic of the microbial protein sources ( bacterial , viral , etc . ) , is freely available on github .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	cells 2020 , 9 , 1278 2 of 15 known to have negative impacts on the host [ 7 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	most of the inferences between microbial composition changes and disease phenotypes have been based on associations and correlations , with little explanations of the mechanisms driving the phenotypes .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	studying microbiome - host interactions and its influence on host biological mechanisms is important for monitoring health and disease and for discovering / fine - tuning therapeutic interventions .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	such interactions are mediated by the interplay between various molecular components expressed by the host and the microbiome .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	for example , bacterial molecules such as metabolites [ 8 ] , proteins [ 9 - 12 ] , and small rnas [ 13 ] can interact with host molecules and , through host intracellular pathways and regulatory networks , can modulate the expression of genes in various biological processes [ 14 ]
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	[ 15 ] [ 16 ] , thus maintaining healthy states or transition to diseased states .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	besides the metabolite - mediated interactions , protein - protein interactions ( ppis ) are one of the most relevant types of molecular interplay between microbes and host organisms [ 12 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	experimental techniques to test interspecies
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	ppis are time consuming and have limitations imposed by cost [ 1 , [ 17 ]
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	[ 18 ] [ 19 ]
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	[ 20 ] [ 21 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	hence , there is a dearth of validated interspecies ppis in publicly available databases , and these are mostly limited to pathogens .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	however , using predicted microbe - host ppis , it is possible to build interaction networks to better understand the cross - talk between the microbial and host proteins and how these interactions interfere with host metabolism and physiology [ 22 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	recent studies have also shown how protein - protein interactions between emerging pathogens such as covid-19 and the host have enabled the discovery of potential drug candidates for clinical testing and validation [ 23 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	various resources and pipelines which generate or store microbe - host interaction predictions are currently available .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	they include phisto [ 24 ] , patric [ 25 ] , proteopathogen2 [ 26 ] , virbase [ 27 ] , and hpidb [ 28 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	most of these resources store ppis and/or genomic analysis of virulence but are limited to pathogens [ 22 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	tools such as cobra [ 29 ] , raven [ 30 ] , netcooperate [ 31 ] , and kbase [ 32 ] which consider commensal microbes are based on the use of metabolomics data alone [ 33 ] .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	moreover , most of the existing resources and pipelines are confined to predicting the direct molecular interactions at the microbe - host interface and do not infer the downstream effects on functional processes and host signalling pathways .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	to fill these gaps in understanding the effect of the microbiome on the host , we introduce microbiolink - a computational pipeline to analyse microbiome - host interactions at a cellular level using network and systems biology approaches .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	using microbiolink , it is possible to identify potential pathways by which microbes can modulate the expression of key host molecules such as genes , proteins , or micrornas .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	in order to demonstrate the applicability of microbiolink , we performed a case study investigating how the gut microbiome potentially modulates autophagy genes in crohn 's disease ( cd ) .
aebb4e6b9241b996079c9f39ffe4a600cba0af49	by providing custom - made lists of microbial proteins , host receptor proteins , molecular interaction networks , and the target node sets , users can harness the functionalities of microbiolink to understand the mechanisms which mediate the influence of microbial proteins derived from the individual microbes or the microbiome .

85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	when considered in the context of 50 an increasing number of viral infections , including the recently emerged severe acute respiratory 51 syndrome ( sars)-coronavirus ( cov)-2 , where inflammation appears to be the primary driver of 52 life threatening symptoms ( 7 - 12 ) , the ability of type iii ifns to limit immunopathology but maintain 53 antiviral activity is significant .
85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	indeed , discussions on the possible use of ifn - λ against sars-54 cov-2 have begun ( 13 ) and a clinical trial ( 14 ) has been initiated with the human pegylated - ifn-55 λ1a .
85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	despite this interest of the use of type iii ifns to treat viral infections , we know very little 56 about the short - and long - term actions of this family of secreted factors .

85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	during viral infections of the lung , immunopathology may predispose the host to opportunistic 58 bacterial infections , referred to as superinfections , which take advantage of this unbalanced status 59 and often lead to lethal consequences ( 15 - 17 ) .
85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	in contrast to its protective effect against acute 60 viral infections , ifn - λ was found to decrease bacterial control in virus - bacteria superinfection 61 models(18 - 20 ) .
85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	whether this is due to the anti - inflammatory activity of ifn - λ that results in a 62 reduced resistance of the host to a subsequent bacterial infection or to the capacity of this group 63 of interferons to alter the physiology of the lung upon a viral encounter remains unresolved .
85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	as 64 of present the contribution of type iii ifn to the human pathology of severe viral infections and 65 bacterial superinfections is unknown .
85526a82800d740c91c276b0747efd33d07146c6	superinfections represent the first cause of lethality upon 66 influenza virus infection ( 21 ) and correlate with severity in coronavirus disease ( covid)-19 67 4 patients ( 11 , 22 - 24 ) .

932b0bc60dd3c137493e0dd0cb2c4833919aa9a4	as these applications evolve and mature , it is evident that many of these applications must address similar requirements , such as policies , security and flexibility .
932b0bc60dd3c137493e0dd0cb2c4833919aa9a4	it is important a software architecture is created to meet these requirements .
932b0bc60dd3c137493e0dd0cb2c4833919aa9a4	we outline the requirements for a public health surveillance application , and define a set of common components to address these requirements .
932b0bc60dd3c137493e0dd0cb2c4833919aa9a4	these components are configured to produce services used in the development of public health applications .

5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	the clinical characteristics and chest imaging findings of viral pneumonia and several interstitial lung diseases ( ilds ) overlap , and viral pneumonia may be underrecognized and misdiagnosed as certain ilds .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	to clarify the frequency of viral pneumonia among patients with acute progressive clinical courses that required a differential diagnosis between ilds and pneumonia , and to determine the most frequent ilds misdiagnosed in cases of viral pneumonia .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	we retrospectively analyzed patients hospitalized from 2010 to 2017 with an acute clinical course ( ! 30 days ) who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) for the differential diagnosis of infection and ilds .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	we performed a multiplex pcr for respiratory viruses using the patients ' preserved bal fluid .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	the final diagnosis was made by a multidisciplinary approach and after considering the pcr results .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	the diagnosis at discharge was compared to the final diagnosis .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	results among the 109 patients , 53 were diagnosed with viral pneumonia .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	viral pneumonia and other diseases showed some differences in symptoms and laboratory data ; however , the differences were small or overlapped .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	viral pneumonia was misdiagnosed on discharge as acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia , cryptogenic organizing pneumonia , or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia ( afop / cop / cep )
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	( n=22 ) , acute interstitial pneumonia ( n=5 ) , connective tissue disease - related ilds ( n=3 ) , unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia ( n=2 ) , drug - induced ild ( n=1 ) , and pneumonia ( n=20 ) .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	conclusion
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	approximately half of the patients who underwent bal had viral pneumonia .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	the most common ild - related misdiagnoses were afop / cop / cep .
5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9	differences in symptoms and laboratory findings between viral pneumonia and other diseases were small , and viral pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis when physicians encounter cases in which the abovementioned ilds are suspected .
564a3bbd035d9730cf4a71f5299fd92c83deaecc	an efficient lewis acid - promoted cascade reaction with dimethyl sulfoxide as a methylene source for the synthesis of michael acceptors is reported .
564a3bbd035d9730cf4a71f5299fd92c83deaecc	the key to developing this procedure is the selection of a mild base to modulate the equilibrium of various intermediates in order to drive the reaction forward to the formation of michael acceptor and dimeric compound products .

93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	structural hdv domains , amino acid motifs , and post - translational modifications of hdag regulate the processes of hdv transcription , nuclear localization and export , and replication .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	rna - editing of the amber stop codon of the antigenomic strand leads to l - hdag mrna transcription .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	l - hdag acts mainly as an inhibitor of certain stages of hdv rna replication and is required for virion assembly and attachment to hbv envelope proteins ( 1 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	farnesylation of the c - terminus cys-211 is a crucial modification required for incorporating hdv particles into hbv envelope proteins ( 2 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	recent experimental evidence demonstrates that hdv infectious particles can be produced using envelope proteins from viruses other than hbv ( 3 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	however , farnesylation of the l - hdag c - terminus is a requirement .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	as with the recently described snake deltavirus , duck - associated , and other vertebrate and invertebrate deltavirus sequences ( 4 - 6 ) , the rodent deltavirus ( rdev ) orf does not encode the cxxq c - terminal motif required for packaging .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	genomic and antigenomic hdv rna replication takes place in the nucleus , with genomic hdv rna and mrna synthesized in nuclear bodies , and antigenomic hdv rna replicated in the nucleolus ( 7 , 8) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	s - hdag employs dna - dependent rna polymerase ii ( pol - ii ) for genomic hdv rna replication by functionally interacting with its clamp formation , forcing it to use an rna instead of a dna template ( 9 , 10 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	hdv rna genomes are replicated under a double rolling - circle replication scheme , forming multimers that are later self - cleaved by ribozyme structures ( 11 - 13 ) .

93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	the coiled - coil domain at the n - terminal hdag is responsible for the formation of dimers / multimers as well as for activating / promoting and inhibiting rna replication ( 15 , 16 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	the hdv nuclear localization signal ( nls ) is located between residues 66 - 75 on the s - hdag with the conserved amino acid domains 66-egappakrar-75 ( 17 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	essential for the nuclear import are the acidic glutamic acid residue at position 66 and the basic arginine residue at position 75 ( 17 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	s - rdeag shows a slightly different nls composition , although presenting an acidic aspartic acid residue at position 66 and a basic arginine residue at position 74 .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	pro-205 of the l - hdag is critical for the nuclear export signal 's ( nes ) functionality , which directs l - hdag to the cytoplasm via a chromosome region maintenance 1
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	( crm1)-independent pathway , a transport factor found at nuclear pores ( 18 , 19 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	however , nuclear export of genomic hdv rna is independent of l - hdag and because genomic hdv rna is synthesized by pol - ii , it has been speculated that it may be exported by the same mechanism as for splicing - dependent cellular mrnas ( 18 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	s - hdag is an essential activator for hdv rna replication and undergoes the following modifications : i ) arg-13 methylation , ii )

93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	methylation at arg-13 is essential for translocating s - hdag to the nucleus and for antigenomic rna replication ( 20 , 21 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	experimental evidence shows this site to be involved in transporting the antigenomic rna into the nucleus ( 21 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	non - methylated s - hdag mediates the nuclear transport of genomic hdv rna ( 21 ) .
93e002e505bc6338cb5d9818366a15e545e451d5	the nuclear transport of hdag is also mediated by lys-72 acetylation ( 22 ) .

87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	rabies remains a major public health concern in many developing countries .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	the precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown , though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	mice that received intranasal inoculation of an attenuated rabies virus ( rabv ) strain hep - flury exhibited subtle clinical signs , and eventually recovered , which is different from the fatal encephalitis caused by the virulent rabv strain cvs-11 .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	to understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance , we applied rna sequencing ( rna - seq ) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. hep - flury or cvs-11 intranasally inoculated mice .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	our results revealed that both rabv strains altered positively and negatively the expression levels of many host genes , including genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity , inflammation and cell death .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	it is found that hep - flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the rig - i / mda-5 signaling , and the innate immunity pre - activated by hep - flury or newcastle disease virus ( ndv ) infection can effectively prevent the cvs-11 to invade central nervous system ( cns ) , but fails to clear the cvs-11 after its entry into the cns .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	in addition , following cvs-11 infection , genes implicated in cell adhesion , blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up - regulated , while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down - regulated .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	on the other hand , several genes involved in the mhc class ii - mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the hep - flury infection as compared with the cvs-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of cd4 + t cells and mhc class ii - mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated rabv from the cns .
87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	the differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post - exposure treatment window for rabv infection .

a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	the study of the pathogenesis , spread regularity , and development trend of infectious diseases not only provides a theoretical basis for future research on infectious diseases , but also has practical guiding significance for the prevention and control of their spread .
a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	in this paper , a controlled differential equation and an objective function of infectious diseases were established by mathematical modeling .
a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	based on cellular automata theory and a compartmental model , the slirds (
a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	susceptible - latent - infected - recovered - dead - susceptible ) model was constructed , a model which can better reflect the actual infectious process of infectious diseases .
a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	considering the spread of disease in different populations , the model combines population density , sex ratio , and age structure to set the evolution rules of the model .
a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	finally , on the basis of the slirds model , the complex spread process of pandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) was simulated .
a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	the simulation results are similar to the macroscopic characteristics of pandemic influenza a ( h1n1 ) in real life , thus the accuracy and rationality of the slirds model are confirmed .
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	plant artificial micro - rnas ( amirs ) have been engineered to target viral genomes and induce their degradation .
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	however , the exceptional evolutionary plasticity of rna viruses threatens the durability of the resistance conferred by these amirs .
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	it has recently been shown that viral populations not experiencing strong selective pressure from an antiviral amir may already contain enough genetic variability in the target sequence to escape plant resistance in an almost deterministic manner .
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	furthermore , it has also been shown that viral populations exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of the antiviral amir speed up this process .
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	in this article , we have characterized the molecular evolutionary dynamics of an amir target sequence in a viral genome under both conditions .
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	the use of illumina ultradeep sequencing has allowed us to identify virus sequence variants at frequencies as low as 2
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	â 10 à6 and to track their variation in time before and
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	after the viral population was able of successfully infecting plants fully resistant to the ancestral virus .
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	we found that every site in the amir - target sequence of the viral genome presented variation and that the variant that eventually broke resistance was sampled among the many coexisting ones .
74c27dd895ee9f14d0b9584b8a3551a0600f05e2	in this system , viral evolution in fully susceptible plants results from an equilibrium between mutation and genetic drift , whereas evolution in partially resistant plants originates from more complex dynamics involving mutation , selection , and drift .

7270d1edf2f31f3eefd3130ff8a97ff6840e3248	in spite of the favourable results in majority of our patients , our study shows that patients with sarcoma operated at the height of the pandemic are at a risk of contracting covid-19 and also having associated with mortality .
7270d1edf2f31f3eefd3130ff8a97ff6840e3248	the use of a covidfree facility , surgery in patients < 60 60 years and in asa i & ii category are associated with better outcomes .
7270d1edf2f31f3eefd3130ff8a97ff6840e3248	if a second wave occurs , a serious consideration should be given to ways of minimising the risk of contracting covid-19 in these vulnerable patients either by using covid - free facilities or delaying treatment until peak of infection has passed .

97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5	in this work , we used gene expression and virus growth data from influenza - infected mice to determine how moderate and deadly influenza viruses may invoke unique inflammatory responses and the role these responses play in disease pathology .
97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5	we found that the relationship between virus growth and the inflammatory response for all viruses tested can be characterized by ultrasensitive response in which the inflammatory response is gated until a threshold concentration of virus is exceeded in the lung after which strong inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production occurs .
97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5	this finding challenges the notion that deadly influenza viruses invoke unique cytokine and inflammatory responses and provides additional evidence that pathology is regulated by virus load , albeit in a highly nonlinear fashion .
97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5	these findings suggests immunomodulatory treatments could focus on altering inflammatory response dynamics to improve disease pathology .

70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	we develop an automatic control system to help to design efficient mitigation measures for the covid-19 epidemic in cities .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	taking into account parameters associated to the population of each city and the mobility among them , the optimal control framework suggests the level and duration of protective measures that must be implemented to ensure that the number of infected individuals is within a range that avoids the collapse of the health care system .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	compared against other mitigation measures that are implemented simultaneously and in equal strength across cities our method has three major particularities when : accounts for city commute and health infrastructure : it takes into account the daily commute among cities to estimate the dynamics of infected people while keeping the number of infected people within a desired level at each city avoiding the collapse of its health care system .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	city - specific control
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	: it allows for orchestrating the control measures among cities so as to prevent all cities to face the same level control .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	the model tends to induce alternation between periods of stricter controls and periods of a more normal life in each city and among the cities .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	flexible scenarios : it is flexible enough to allow for simulating the impact of particular actions .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	for example , one can simulate the how the control all cities change when the number of care beds increases in specific places .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	therefore , our method creates an automatic dance adjusting mitigation levels within cities and alternating among cities as suggested in [ 9 ] .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	this automatic dance may help the city economy and orchestration of resources .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	we provide case studies using the major cities of the state of são paulo given by using estimates on the daily mobility among the cities their health care system capacity .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	we use official data in our case studies .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	however , sub - notification of infected people in brazil is notoriously high .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	hence the case study should not be considered as a real world policy suggestion .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	it high sub - notification is taken into account , the optimal control algorithm will suggest stricter mitigation measures , as also shown in the case studies .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	surprisingly , the total duration of the protocol for the state is barely affected by the subnotification , but the severity of such protocols is strengthened .
70fc6ee69793636a9f01192e42be83fbd29ce04a	this stresses a twofold implication , first , the protocol depends on high - quality data and , second , such optimal and orchestrated protocol is robust and can be adjusted to the demand .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	covid-19 is a severe acute respiratory disease caused by sars - cov-2 , a novel betacoronavirus discovered in december 2019 and closely related to the sars coronavirus ( cov ) .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	both viruses use the human ace2 receptor for cell entry , recognizing it with the receptor binding domain ( rbd ) of the s1 subunit of the viral spike ( s ) protein .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	the s2 domain mediates viral fusion with the host cell membrane .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	experience with sars and mers coronavirus has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against the rbd can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor ( ace2 for sars ) and block the virus cell entry .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	assuming that a similar strategy would be successful against sars - cov-2 , we used phage display to select from the human naïve universal antibody gene libraries hal9/10
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	anti sars2 spike antibodies capable of inhibiting interaction with ace2 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	309 unique fully human antibodies against s1 were identified .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	17 showed more than 75 % inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ace2 , assessed by flow cytometry and several antibodies showed even an 50 % inhibition at a molar ratio of the antibody to spike protein or rbd of 1:1 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	furthermore , these antibodies neutralized active sars -

81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	all 17 were all able to bind the isolated rbd , four of them with sub - nanomolar ec50 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	epitope analysis of the antibodies revealed that six bind at the rbd - ace2 interface and two on the opposite side of the domain .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	universal libraries from healthy donors offer the advantage that antibodies can be generated quickly and independent from the availability of material from recovered patients in a pandemic situation .

81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	four years later , a novel coronavirus causing a severe pneumonia was discovered and later named sars - cov-2 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	the outbreak started on a sea food market in wuhan , hubei province ( china ) at the end of 2019 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	the disease was named covid-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ) by the world health organization ( who ) .

81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	the spike ( s ) protein of sars - cov-2 , as well as sars - cov , binds to the human zinc peptidase angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) which is expressed on lung cells , heart , kidney and intestine cells and acts as receptor for virus entry .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	s protein consists of the n - terminal s1 subunit , which includes the receptor binding domain ( rbd ) , and the cterminal s2 subunit which is anchored to the viral membrane and is required for trimerization and fusion of the virus and host membrane 4 - 6 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	the membrane bound host protease tmprss2 is responsible for s protein priming by cleavage of specific sites between s1 and s2 .

81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	antibodies against the spike protein of corona viruses are potential candidates for therapeutic development 11 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	antibodies against the s1 subunit , especially against rbd , can potently neutralize sars - cov and mers 12 - 14 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	monoclonal human antibodies against sars - cov were also described to cross - react with sars - cov-2 , some of them were able to neutralize sars - cov-2 15,16 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	in other approaches monoclonal antibodies against sars - cov-2 were selected by rescreening memory b - cells from a sars patient 17 , selected from covid-19 patients by single b - cell pcr 18,19 or using phage display 20,21 .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	human recombinant antibodies were successfully used for the treatment of other viral diseases .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	the antibody mab114 22 and the three antibody cocktail regn - eb3 23 showed a good efficiency in clinical trials against ebola virus 24 .

81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	antibody phage display is a powerful tool to generate human antibodies against infectious diseases 27 .

81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	the lambda ( hal9 ) and kappa ( hal10 ) libraries were combined and the antigen s1-hfc ( with furin site , produced in high five cells ) was immobilized in pbs .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	here , only seven unique antibodies were identified .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	in a second approach , the selection was performed separately for hal10 ( ste72 ) and hal9 ( ste73 ) using s1-hfc as antigen ( without furin site , sec purified , immobilized in carbonate buffer ) .
81a6c0736cb73f25434d0f681fa93d83b2b795ec	here , 90 unique antibodies were selected from hal10 and 210 from hal9 .

3cff423d90d10aed4310a7d726a6a873d37b2693	in this study , we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel , synthetic , dna vaccine targeting the pre - membrane+envelope proteins ( prme ) of zikv .
3cff423d90d10aed4310a7d726a6a873d37b2693	following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct , mice and non - human primates were immunised with this prme dna - based immunogen through electroporation - mediated enhanced dna delivery .
3cff423d90d10aed4310a7d726a6a873d37b2693	vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen - specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity .

3cff423d90d10aed4310a7d726a6a873d37b2693	in addition , passive transfer of non - human primate anti - zikv immune serum protected ifnar − / − mice against subsequent viral challenge .
3cff423d90d10aed4310a7d726a6a873d37b2693	this study in nhp and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prme in zikv infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for zikv control and disease prevention in humans .
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	hematopoietic cell transplantation ( hct ) is associated with profound compromises in host defenses .
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	the patterns of immune compromise change over time .
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	infections are an important cause of serious morbidity and pose substantial threats to life .
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	thus , the challenges of infection facing the transplant clinician are both myriad and dynamic .
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	early after transplant , neutropenic infections are most important .
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	later herpesvirus and invasive fungal infections predominate .
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	even late after transplant , patients with chronic graft versus host disease remain susceptible to encapsulated bacterial , varicella zoster virus , and invasive fungal infections .
1869016477ca8874c87f649e941017b40b8bfa47	over time , with robust engraftment and control of gvhd , the risk of serious infections recedes with immune reconstitution .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms , as well as by non - infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	it is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	therefore , we used high - throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	in parallel , samples from specific pathogen - free pigs were also analysed .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	this study showed a variable co - infection rate in the different pigs .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	the differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs , while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	in addition , the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained , as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	the results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness .
cda16c8657cf582952bfe3a8e6756acaa8449452	this knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral - viral interactions in relation to disease development .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	the middle east respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus ( mers - cov ) can cause severe disease and has pandemic potential .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	therefore , development of antiviral strategies is an important task .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	the activation of the viral spike protein ( s ) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity and the responsible enzymes are potential therapeutic targets .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	the cellular proteases furin , cathepsin l and tmprss2 can activate mers - s and may cleave the s protein at two distinct sites , termed s1 / s2
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	and s2′.
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	moreover , a potential cathepsin l cleavage site in mers - s has been reported .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	however , the relative importance of these sites for mers - s activation is incompletely understood .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	here , we used mutagenic analysis and mers - s - bearing vectors to study the contribution of specific cleavage sites to s proteindriven entry .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	we found that an intact s1 / s2 site was only required for efficient entry into cells expressing endogenous tmprss2 .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	in keeping with a previous study , pre - cleavage at the s1 / s2 motif ( rsvr ) was important although not essential for subsequent mers - s activation by tmprss2 , and indirect evidence was obtained that this motif is processed by a protease depending on an intact rxxr motif , most likely furin .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	in contrast , the s2′ site ( rsar ) was required for robust viral entry into all cell lines tested and the integrity of one of the two arginines was sufficient for efficient entry .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	these findings suggest that cleavage at s2′ is carried out by proteases recognizing a single arginine , most likely tmprss2 and cathepsin
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	l. finally , mutation of the proposed cathepsin l site did not impact viral entry and double mutation of s1 / s2 and s2′ site was compatible with cathepsin l - but not tmprss2-dependent host cell entry , indicating that cathepsin l can process the s protein at auxiliary sites .
1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771	collectively , our results indicate a rigid sequence requirement for s protein activation by tmprss2 but not cathepsin l.
9f548a03c496ef67ce743572cca4201debbf9910	clinical research under the usual regulatory constraints may be difficult or even impossible in a public health emergency .
9f548a03c496ef67ce743572cca4201debbf9910	regulators must seek to strike a good balance in granting as wide therapeutic access to new drugs as possible at the same time as gathering sound evidence of safety and effectiveness .

b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	objectives :
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	youtube has become the preferred resource for trainees in otolaryngology to prepare for surgery .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	this study aimed to compare the evaluation by 2 attending physicians and 2 resident physicians of the quality of videos on youtube on neck dissection , a key indicator case in head and neck surgery .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	the authors aimed to assess the quality and quantity of youtube videos available for development of a virtual surgical educational curriculum for trainees in otolaryngology .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	methods :
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	using the youtube search feature , the top 10 videos by relevance and view count were compiled using the following search terms : radical neck dissection , selective neck dissection , modified radical neck dissection , lateral neck dissection ,
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	levels i - iii neck dissection , levels ii - iv , left neck dissection , right neck dissection , cervical nodal dissection , and supraomohyoid neck dissection .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	a total of 37 videos on neck dissection were identified and analyzed using the lap - vegas criteria as well as authorspecific modified lap - vegas criteria .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	the mean comprehensive lap - vegas score was 8.74 ( sd 3.10 ) .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	the majority of videos ( 24/37 ) were designated as medium quality ; 10 of 37 videos were low quality and 3 of 37 videos were high quality .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	in the total group analysis , there was excellent inter - rater reliability between attending physicians ( cohen 's kappa coefficient of 0.84 ) and good inter - rater reliability between resident physicians ( cohen 's kappa coefficient of 0.58 ) .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	there was no correlation between total view count , video age , or number of likes / dislikes and the overall lap - vegas score .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	the presence of audio or written commentary had a moderate positive correlation with lap - vegas score ( adjusted r 2 of 0.36 ) .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	there was no statistically significant difference in video quality between videos posted by us and non - us based physicians ( 95 % confidence interval à0.10 to 4.10 ; p = 0.06 ) .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	however , videos made by an otolaryngology - trained physician had a lap - vegas score that was 3.93 points higher ( 95 % confidence interval 2.34 - 5.52 ; p < 0.001 ) than that of videos made by a nonotolaryngology - trained physician .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	conclusions :
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	online videos of neck dissection represent an increasingly ubiquitous and appropriate resource for trainees in learning otolaryngology key indicator cases .
b4bd4fc7a98e91130677670eb18c20ac3cf1b345	while free - to - access video repositories , such as youtube , have become increasingly popular among trainees as a primary resource for learning and preparing for surgical cases , they lack consistent quality and as such , global efforts should be taken to improve the breadth and depth of educational video content in otolaryngology .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	the prevalence of poor sleep quality among students is very high and , in nursing students , has been associated with reduced performance , behavioral changes , dietary changes , and even aggressive behavior due to changes in sleep patterns .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	the lockdown in response to covid-19 may have resulted in lifestyle changes that affected sleep quality .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	for this reason , the objective of this study is to determine the difference in nursing students ' sleep quality before and during the lockdown , put in place in response to the coronavirus ( covid-19 ) pandemic .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	to meet this objective , we conducted a longitudinal observational study on 207 nursing students , with two cut - off points ( february and april ) .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	the main dependent variable was sleep quality , measured using the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) and its seven components .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	parametric and nonparametric tests were used for paired and unpaired data , as well as group - stratified analysis .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	the mean time students spent in bed was 7.6 h ( standard deviation ( sd )
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	= 1.1 h ) before lockdown and 8.5 h ( sd = 1.2 h ) during lockdown .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	the psqi score got 0.91 points worse during lockdown
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	( 95 % ci , −0.51 , −1.31 ) .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	of the five components , five were statistically significantly affected ( p ≤ 0.05 ) , and of these , the most changed were sleep latency , sleep duration , and sleep efficiency .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	when stratified by group , we observed differences in women , first - year students , second - year students , alcohol consumers , those of normal weight , and those that live with family .
0b71cfe8bc692f5d07c83af9619cf3be7402ee9c	the main conclusion is that although students spent more time in bed , overall sleep quality was worse during lockdown , as well as being worse in five of the seven components .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	the presence of a schema for xml documents has numerous advantages .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	unfortunately , many xml documents in practice are not accompanied by a schema or a valid schema .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	therefore , it is essential to devise algorithms to infer schemas .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	the fundamental task in xml schema inference is to learn regular expressions .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	in this paper , we focus on learning the subclass of re ( & ) called sires ( the subclass of regular expressions with interleaving ) .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	previous work in this direction lacks inference algorithms that support inference from positive and negative examples .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	we provide an algorithm to learn sires from positive and negative examples based on genetic algorithms and parallel techniques .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	our algorithm also has better expansibility , which means that our algorithm not only supports learning with positive and negative examples , but also supports learning with positive or negative examples only .
956ed73c60311f2f22b12ad5424dc56083a42cdd	experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm .
16a4b3acbf0f8aeecd2156786377cbe85bd648aa	peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) represent an accessible tissue source for gene expression profiling in schizophrenia that could provide insight into the molecular basis of the disorder .
16a4b3acbf0f8aeecd2156786377cbe85bd648aa	this study used the illumina ht_12 microarray platform and quantitative real time pcr ( qpcr ) to perform mrna expression profiling on 114 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 80 non - psychiatric controls from the australian schizophrenia research bank ( asrb ) .
16a4b3acbf0f8aeecd2156786377cbe85bd648aa	differential expression analysis revealed altered expression of 164 genes ( 59 up - regulated and 105 down - regulated ) in the pbmcs from patients with schizophrenia compared to controls .
16a4b3acbf0f8aeecd2156786377cbe85bd648aa	bioinformatic analysis indicated significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes known to be involved or associated with immune function and regulating the immune response .

16a4b3acbf0f8aeecd2156786377cbe85bd648aa	genome - wide expression analysis of pbmcs from individuals with schizophrenia was characterized by the alteration of genes with immune system function , supporting the hypothesis that the disorder has a significant immunological component in its etiology .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	defensins are an effector component of the innate immune system with broad antimicrobial activity .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	humans express two types of defensins , -and -defensins , which have antiviral activity against both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	the diversity of defensin - sensitive viral species reflects a multitude of antiviral mechanisms .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	these include direct defensin targeting of viral envelopes , glycoproteins , and capsids in addition to inhibition of viral fusion and post - entry neutralization .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	binding and modulation of host cell surface receptors and disruption of intracellular signaling by defensins can also inhibit viral replication .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	in addition , defensins can function as chemokines to augment and alter adaptive immune responses , revealing an indirect antiviral mechanism .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	nonetheless , many questions regarding the antiviral activities of defensins remain .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	although significant mechanistic data is known for -defensins , molecular details fordefensin inhibition are mostly lacking .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	importantly , the role of defensin antiviral activity in vivo has not been addressed due to the lack of a complete defensin knockout model .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	overall , the antiviral activity of defensins is well established as are the variety of mechanisms by which defensins achieve this inhibition ; however , additional research is needed to fully understand the role of defensins in viral pathogenesis .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	simplex virus 1 ( hsv-1 ) was one of the defining criteria in the identification and purification of the -defensins human neutrophil peptide 1 ( hnp1 ) , hnp2 , and hnp3 from human neutrophils 3 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	in this review , we will summarize the known activities of -anddefensins against viruses , and we refer the reader to additional recent reviews on this topic for further insight 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	our focus will be primarily on human defensins , and we have organized our discussion by mechanism ( figure 1 ) to emphasize commonalities in the antiviral activities of defensins against diverse viral families .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	the structure , evolution , and tissue distribution of defensins have been summarized in a number of recent reviews 4 ; 8 ; 9 ; 10 ; 11 ; 12 ; 13 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	briefly , defensins are small ( ~29 - 42 amino acid ) cationic , amphipathic peptides with a predominantly -sheet structure stabilized by 3 disulfide bonds .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	they can be broadly classified on the basis of structure and disulfide bond organization into three groups : - , - , and -defensins .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	as humans lack -defensins , they will not be discussed in detail ; however , their antiviral properties have been recently reviewed 8 ; 14 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	humans express six -defensins and up to 31 -defensins 15 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	the -defensins can be further subdivided into myeloid ( hnp1 - 4 ) and enteric [ human defensin ( hd ) 5 and 6 ] peptides on the basis of both expression patterns and genetic organization 11 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	all of thedefensins have been shown to multimerize into at least dimers either in solution or in crystal structures 16 ; 17 ; 18 ; 19 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	hnp1 - 4 are predominantly expressed by neutrophils but can also be found in or expressed by monocyte / macrophages , natural killer ( nk ) cells , some t cells , b cells , and immature dendritic cells ( dcs ) 11 ; 13 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	hd5 and hd6 are expressed by specialized epithelial paneth cells of the small intestine 20 ; 21 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	hd5 is also expressed by epithelial cells in the male and female genitourinary tract 22 ; 23 ; 24 ; 25 .
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	human -defensins
89d2e3da9d28446b9b8209cad5107c7a0dd85d83	( hbds ) are more widely expressed by epithelial cells in skin and at mucosal surfaces in contact with the environment 26 .

8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	in this study , we show that reducing the levels of expression of ctsw reduces viral titers for different subtypes of iav , and we map the target step of ctsw requirement to viral entry .

8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	targeting ctsw , we demonstrate that knockdown of ctsw results in a decrease of iav nucleoprotein accumulation in the nuclei of infected cells at 3 h postinfection .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	assays specific for the individual stages of iav entry further show that attachment , internalization , and early endosomal trafficking are not affected by
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	ctsw knockdown .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	however , we detected impaired escape of viral particles from late endosomes in ctsw knockdown cells .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	moreover , fusion analysis with a dual - labeled influenza virus revealed a significant reduction in fusion events , with no detectable impact on endosomal ph , suggesting that ctsw is required at the stage of viral fusion .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	the defect in iav entry upon ctsw knockdown could be rescued by ectopic expression of wild - type ctsw but not by the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of ctsw , suggesting that the proteolytic activity of ctsw is required for successful entry of iav .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	our results establish ctsw as an important host factor for entry of iav into target cells and suggest that ctsw could be a promising target for the development of future antiviral drugs .

8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	however , we have only limited knowledge on how these factors support virus replication , which would be required for drug development .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	we have characterized cathepsin w , one of the candidate factors , and found that cathepsin w is required for escape of influenza virus from the late endosome .
8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670	importantly , this required the proteolytic activity of cathepsin

6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02	to see whether genetic polymorphisms regulate inter - individual differences in t cell subset levels , we have conducted a genome scan in two populations of mice , bred as the progeny of a cross between cb6f1 females and c3d2f1 males .
6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02	the data document quantitative trait loci ( qtl ) with statistically significant effects on cd4 , cd8 , and cd8 memory t cells , and on subsets of cd4 and cd8 t cells that express p - glycoprotein .
6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02	some of the loci detected were robust , in the sense that they produced effects of similar size both in mated female mice , and in a population that included male and female virgin animals .
6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02	some of the effects were stable , in that they were apparent at both 8 and 18 months of age , but others were age - specific , showing effects either at 8 or at 18 months but not at both ages .
6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02	genes that had an effect on the same t cell subset were in almost all cases additive rather than epistatic , and their combined effects could produce large overall effects , leading in the most dramatic case to a two - fold difference in cd8 memory cells .
6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02	the analysis also documented two qtl , on chromosomes 4 and 13 , that regulate an age - sensitive composite index of t cell subset pattern which has been shown previously to be a predictor of life expectancy in these mice .
6bbd25f424bf90e5d9bc134e2d799817495c9e02	the analysis thus reveals both subset - specific genes and others which modulate the overall pattern of age - sensitive changes in t cell subset distributions .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	one of the hurdles to understanding the role of viral quasispecies in rna virus cross - species transmission
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	( cst ) events is the need to analyze a densely sampled outbreak using deep sequencing in order to measure the amount of mutation occurring on a small time scale .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	in 2009 , the california department of public health reported a dramatic increase ( .350 % ) in the number of gray foxes infected with a rabies virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in humboldt county .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	to better understand the evolution of rabies , deep - sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the humboldt outbreak .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	for each sample , approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the illumina platform .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	average coverage was 17,4486and
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date ( 1995 vs. 2009 ) and geographic location ( northern vs. southern ) .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	a single amino acid change in the g protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks , suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	deepsequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the cst event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003 - 2010 were present at the sub - consensus level ( as rare variants in the viral population ) in skunk and fox samples from 1995 .
e5526afbb4d770dabb8c34da47c1267ee3342959	these results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change .

eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	phylogeny estimation from aligned haplotype sequences has attracted more and more attention in the recent years due to its importance in analysis of many fine - scale genetic data .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	its application fields range from medical research , to drug discovery , to epidemiology , to population dynamics .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	the literature on molecular phylogenetics proposes a number of criteria for selecting a phylogeny from among plausible alternatives .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	usually , such criteria can be expressed by means of objective functions , and the phylogenies that optimize them are referred to as optimal .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	one of the most important estimation criteria is the parsimony which states that the optimal phylogeny t * for a set h of n haplotype sequences over a common set of variable loci is the one that satisfies the following requirements : ( i ) it has the shortest length and ( ii )
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	it is such that , for each pair of distinct haplotypes h i , h j ∈ h , the sum of the edge weights belonging to the path from h i to h j in t * is not smaller than the observed number of changes between h i and h j .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	finding the most parsimonious phylogeny for h involves solving an optimization problem , called the most parsimonious phylogeny estimation problem ( mppep ) , which is n p - hard in many of its versions .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	results :
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	in this article we investigate a recent version of the mppep that arises when input data consist of single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes extracted from a population of individuals on a common genomic region .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	specifically , we explore the prospects for improving on the implicit enumeration strategy of implicit enumeration strategy used in previous work using a novel problem formulation and a series of strengthening valid inequalities and preliminary symmetry breaking constraints to more precisely bound the solution space and accelerate implicit enumeration of possible optimal phylogenies .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	we present the basic formulation and then introduce a series of provable valid constraints to reduce the solution space .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	we then prove that these constraints can often lead to significant reductions in the gap between the optimal solution and its non - integral linear programming bound relative to the prior art as well as often substantially faster processing of moderately hard problem instances .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	conclusion :
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	we provide an indication of the conditions under which such an optimal enumeration approach is likely to be feasible , suggesting that these strategies are usable for relatively large numbers of taxa , although with stricter limits on numbers of variable sites .
eb5f4f63cdb4bfd57256d362dbd01063522c9f05	the work thus provides methodology suitable for provably optimal solution of some harder instances that resist all prior approaches .

a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	ebola hemorrhagic fever is caused by the ebola filovirus ( ebov ) , which is one of the most aggressive infectious agents known worldwide .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	the ebov pathogenesis starts with uncontrolled viral replication and subversion of both the innate and adaptive host immune response .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	the multifunctional viral vp35 protein is involved in this process by exerting an antagonistic action against the early antiviral alpha / beta interferon ( ifn - α / β ) response , and represents a suitable target for the development of strategies to control ebov infection .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	phage display technology permits to select antibodies as single chain fragment variable ( scfv ) from an artificial immune system , due to their ability to specifically recognize the antigen of interest .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	scfv is ideal for genetic manipulation and to obtain antibody constructs useful for targeting either antigens expressed on cell surface or intracellular antigens if the scfv is expressed as intracellular antibody ( intrabody ) or delivered into the cells .

a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	monoclonal antibodies ( mab ) in scfv format specific for the ebov vp35 were isolated from the eth-2 library of human recombinant antibodies by phage display technology .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	five different clones were identified by sequencing , produced in e.coli and expressed in cho mammalian cells to be characterized in vitro .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	all the selected scfvs were able to react with recombinant vp35 protein in elisa , one of the scfvs being also able to react in western blot assay ( wb ) .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	in addition , all scfvs were expressed in cell cytoplasm as intrabodies ; a luciferase reporter gene inhibition assay performed in a549 cells showed that two of the scfvs can significantly hamper the inhibition of the ifn - β - induced rig - i signaling cascade mediated by ebov vp35 .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	conclusion :
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	five antibodies in scfv format recognize an active form of ebov vp35 in elisa , while one antibody also recognizes vp35 in wb .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	two of these scfvs were also able to interfere with the intracellular activity of vp35 in a cell system in vitro .
a0797dceb80b7f1c136590f3ba4b16da218de23f	these findings suggest that such antibodies in scfv format might be employed to develop therapeutic molecules able to hamper ebov infections .
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	the objective was to describe the probability of cryptosporidium parvum fecal oocyst shedding at different magnitudes of exposure , the pattern of fecal shedding over time , and factors affecting fecal shedding in dairy calves .
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	within the first 24 h of life , 36 calves were experimentally challenged with c. parvum oocysts at one of four possible magnitudes of oral exposure ( 1×10 3 , 1×10 4 , 1×10 5 , and 1× 10 6 oocysts ) , and 7 control calves were sham dosed .
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	fecal shedding occurred in 33 ( 91.7 % )
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves .
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	there was a difference in the log - total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups ; calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure ( 1×10 3 oocysts ) shed less than the other three groups .
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	at higher magnitudes of exposure , there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding .
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	there was an inverse relationship between the log - total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf , i.e. , the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding , the fewer oocysts that were shed .
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	the pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear ; the number of oocysts increased with time , reached a peak , and declined .
cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d	therefore , the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting exposure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding .

7aa307b2fa1b8d8aa3fa0a19abc0bd86c1c139cd	in a cross - sectional study , 135 children , ≤5 years of age who presented with artis in najran maternity and children hospital , najran , saudi arabia between october 2012 and july 2013 were included .
7aa307b2fa1b8d8aa3fa0a19abc0bd86c1c139cd	the clinical and sociodemographic data , and the laboratory results were recorded using a standardized questionnaire .
7aa307b2fa1b8d8aa3fa0a19abc0bd86c1c139cd	two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each child : one for bacteriological examination , and the second for viral detection using multiplex rt - pcr .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	it is unclear which variables contribute to the variance in covid-19 related deaths and covid-19 cases .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	we modelled the relationship of various predictors ( health systems variables , population and population health indicators ) together with variables indicating public health measures ( school closures , border closures , country lockdown ) in 40 european and other countries , using generalized linear models and minimized information criteria to select the best fitting and most parsimonious models .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	we fitted two models with log - linearly linked variables on gamma - distributed outome variables ( cov2 cases and covid-19 related deaths , standardized on population ) .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	population standardized cases were best predicted by number of tests , life - expectancy in a country , and border closure ( negative predictor , i.e. preventive ) .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	population standardized deaths were best predicted by time , the virus had been in the country , life expectancy , smoking ( negative predictor , i.e. preventive ) , and school closures ( positive predictor , i.e. accelerating ) .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	model fit statistics and model adequacy were good .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	interestingly , none of the variables that code for the preparedness of the medical system , for health status or other population parameters were predictive .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	of the public health variables only border closure had the potential of preventing cases and none were predictors for preventing deaths .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	school closures , likely as a proxy for social distancing , was associated with increased deaths .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	the pandemic seems to run its autonomous course and only border closure has the potential to prevent cases .
ae68bb60957f2f5270c662bc37054448e9be1d93	none of the contributes to preventing deaths .
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	aim : to report on a snap audit of all departments in the uk as to the value of preoperative thoracic imaging , preferably computed tomography ( ct ) , of patients undergoing any surgery to assess for changes consistent with covid-19 preoperatively .
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	materials and methods :
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	all imaging departments in the uk were contacted and asked to record the number of preoperative ct examinations performed in patients being considered for both emergency and elective surgical intervention over a 5-day period in may 2020 .
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	results :
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	forty - seven percent of departments replied with data provided on > 820 patients .
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	nineteen percent of additional preoperative ct was in patients undergoing elective intervention and 81 % in patients presenting with surgical abdominal pain .
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	there was a high rate of false positives in patients who tested negative for covid-19 , producing a sensitivity for thoracic ct of 68.4 % .
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	conclusion :
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	this uk - wide audit demonstrates that a large number of additional thoracic imaging examinations over a 5-day period were performed with a low sensitivity for the identification of covid-19 in this preoperative group of patients .
d414489152b2ad91d4f61f284e7c87d10b319b02	given these findings , it is difficult to justify this additional examination in this group of patients .
