0113b9a8d82039e8474e887038d643853b5fdfeb	background : the ministry of health and sanitation ( mohs ) in sierra leone partially rolled out the implementation of integrated disease surveillance and response ( idsr ) in 2003 . after the ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014 - 2015 , there was need to strengthen idsr to ensure prompt detection and response to epidemic - prone diseases . we describe the processes , successes and challenges of revitalizing public health surveillance in a country recovering from a protracted ebola virus disease outbreak . methods : the revitalization process began with adaptation of the revised idsr guidelines and development of customized guidelines to suit the health care systems in sierra leone . public health experts defined data flow , system operations , case definitions , frequency and channels of reporting and dissemination . next , phased training of idsr focal persons in each health facility and the distribution of data collection and reporting tools was done . monitoring activities included periodic supportive supervision and data quality assessments . rapid response teams were formed to investigate and respond to disease outbreak alerts in all districts . results : submission of reports through the idsr system began in mid-2015 and by the 35th epidemiologic week , all district health teams were submitting reports . the key performance indicators measuring the functionality of the idsr system in 2016 and 2017 were achieved ( who africa region target ≥80 % ) ; the annual average proportion of timely weekly health facility reports submitted to the next level was 93 % in 2016 and 97 % in 2017 ; the proportion of suspected outbreaks and public health events detected through the idsr system was 96 % ( n = 87 ) in 2016 and 100 % ( n = 85 ) in 2017 . conclusion : with proper planning , phased implementation and adequate investment of resources , it is possible to establish a functional idsr system in a country recovering from a public health crisis . a functional idsr system requires well trained workforce , provision of the necessary tools and guidelines , information , communication and technology infrastructure to support data transmission , provision of timely feedback as well as logistical support . 
018b1dbd7930fbfa5a2fd5b5d6e6ac3e67aca830	background : while the number of detected sars - cov-2 infections are widely available , an understanding of the extent of undetected cases is urgently needed for an effective tackling of the pandemic . the aim of this work is to estimate the true number of sars - cov-2 ( detected and undetected ) infections in several european countries . the question being asked is : how many cases have actually occurred ? in an open population , based on a day - wise estimator that allows for heterogeneity . the estimator is data - driven and can be easily computed from the distributions of daily cases and deaths . uncertainty surrounding the estimates is obtained using bootstrap methods . results : we focus on the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases at april 17th . differences arise at the country level , and we get estimates ranging from the 3.93 times of norway to the 7.94 times of france . accurate estimates are obtained , as bootstrapbased intervals are rather narrow . many parametric or semi - parametric models have been developed to estimate the population size from aggregated counts leading to an approximation of the missed population and/or to the estimate of the threshold under which the number of missed people can not fall ( i.e. a lower bound ) . here , we provide a methodological contribution introducing an upper bound estimator and provide reliable estimates on the dark number , i.e. how many undetected cases are going around for several european countries , where the epidemic spreads differently .

0333b149fa1bad7b40013227fa125d7a90745265	coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is a global pandemic . governments have implemented combinations of ' lockdown ' measures of various stringencies , including school and workplace closures , cancellations of public events , and restrictions on internal and external movements . these policy interventions are an attempt to shield high risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries ' healthcare systems , or , colloquially , ' flatten the curve ' . however , these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms , group and social harms , and opportunity costs . these policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre - existing inequities , but also generate new ones . we developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorise adverse effects of covid-19 lockdown measures . we based our framework on lorenc and oliver 's framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the progress - plus equity framework . to test its application we purposively sampled covid-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical , psychological , and social harms , as well as opportunity costs , in each of the progress - plus equity domains : place of residence , race / ethnicity , occupation , gender / sex , religion , education , socioeconomic status , social capital , plus ( age , and disability ) . we found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each covid-19 lockdown policy example , stratified by lmic and hic , in every progress - plus equity domain . we identified known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects . the same harms ( anxiety ; depression ; food insecurity ; loneliness ; stigma ; violence ) appear to be repeated across many groups , and are exacerbated by several covid-19 policy interventions . conclusion : our conceptual framework highlights the fact that covid-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms . applying this framework can help in three ways : ( 1 ) identifying areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects ; ( 2 ) mitigating policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence ; and ( 3 ) planning for lifting covid-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world . categories with the remaining four adverse effects domains : direct health harms , psychological harms , group and social harms , and opportunity cost harms . this approach allowed us to ( 1 ) identify relevant peer - reviewed and grey literature of previously known inequities and emerging evidence of the impacts of the lockdown measures , ( 2 ) conceptualise how specific measures may exacerbate , or lead to , inequities , and ( 3 ) relate these considerations to potential mitigation measures . conceptual frameworks represent a network of interlinked concepts in a particular area . they can provide a structure for understanding a phenomenon or subject.(13 ) polit and beck asserted that frameworks can in fact make research more comprehensible , and generalisable . ( 14 ) they are a way to bring together many components on a complex topic , such as covid-19 related inequity . we drew from the literature on health equity impact assessments ( heia ) to develop and complete a ' proof - of - concept ' framework . the world health organization 's commission on social determinants of health highlights the importance of undertaking heias during policy development.(15 ) we iteratively and reflexively developed our framework to cover two dimensions : 1 ) socially - stratifying equity factors , and 2 ) types of harms . these frameworks were developed iteratively through application and testing in systematic reviews , epidemiologic studies , and policy analyses.(4,9,12 ) after testing our framework on emergent reports of covid-19 equity harms , we refined it to capture policies ( rather than programmes ) ; to function on disparate geopolitical levels ; and to capture mitigation strategies . ( 16 ) after we developed the framework , we purposively selected from the many emergent reports of covid-19 policy interventions causing equity harms to demonstrate the application of the framework . we searched the peer - reviewed and emergent covid-19 literature to identify pre - existing evidence on inequities related to the specific harms associated with a particular lockdown policy . we conceptualised the interplay between a given policy , and its equity harms , by drawing upon this literature , and through expert consultation and consensus discussions . we identified examples of ongoing efforts to mitigate the inequity effects generated by the lockdown measures through expert consultation with the campbell and cochrane equity methods group . systematic review of the literature was not performed given ( 1 ) the examples were intended to be illustrative but not exhaustive , ( 2 ) ongoing research and evaluation is needed to measure actual equity harms , and ( 3 ) the need to provide evidence - informed but timely tools in the context of a rapidly evolving situation to draw attention to inequities . we included examples of covid-19 policies to demonstrate how the new framework could be used . we purposively selected our examples of policy interventions from emergent covid-19 literature and media reports to cover : each who region , a range of lenient to stricter policies , one lmic and hic example per progress - plus domain , and measures being monitored by the oxford covid-19 policy tracker.(2 ) we applied our framework to each covid-19 policy case study .

07bf7b392feb438d436be66e2bdfe7513320231b	background : in south korea , an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) occurred in 2015 . it was the second largest mers outbreak . as a result of the outbreak in south korea , 186 infections were reported , and 36 patients died . at least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms . this paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the mers coronavirus ( cov ) , using data on the spread of mers in south korea . the basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population . to estimate the basic reproduction number of the mers - cov , we employ data from the 2015 south korea mers outbreak and the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model , a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . : we fit the model to the epidemic data of the south korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters . also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the sir model . then we determine the basic reproduction number of the mers - cov in south korea in 2015 as 8.0977 . it is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 ebola outbreak in west africa including guinea , sierra leone , and liberia , which had values of 1.5 - 2.5 . conclusions : there was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak , thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of mers , such as the basic reproduction number . an evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak , or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data . such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by korea hospital association .

0d206e54d493ef254aa8c65d0ba986e473dab709	porcine circovirus type 2 ( pcv2 ) has recently been reported to elicit the unfolded protein response ( upr ) via activation of the perk / eif2α ( rna - activated protein kinase - like endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) kinase / eukaryotic initiation factor 2α ) pathway . this study attempted to examine which viral protein might be involved in inducing upr and whether this cellular event would lead to apoptosis of the cells expressing the viral protein . by transient expression , we found that both replicase ( rep ) and capsid ( cap ) proteins of pcv2 could induce er stress as shown by increased phosphorylation of perk with subsequent activation of the eif2α - atf4 ( activating transcription factor 4)-chop ( ccaat / enhancer - binding protein homologous protein ) axis . cap expression , but not rep , significantly reduced antiapoptotic b - cell lymphoma-2 ( bcl-2 ) and increased caspase-3 cleavage , possibly due to increased expression of chop . since knockdown of perk by rna interference clearly reduced cap - induced chop expression , caspase-3 cleavage , and apoptotic cell death possibly by partially rescuing bcl-2 expression , we propose that there is connection between cap - induced upr and apoptosis via the perk / eif2α / atf4 / chop / bcl-2 pathway . this study , together with our earlier studies , provides insight into the mechanisms underlying pcv2 pathogenesis .

0ddcfc9bedfb0a87a7221dd2448bd41d3ba9cc51	acute viral infections pose many practical challenges for the accurate assessment of the impact of novel therapies on viral growth and decay . using the example of influenza a , we illustrate how the measurement of infection - related quantities that determine the dynamics of viral load within the human host , can inform investigators on the course and severity of infection and the efficacy of a novel treatment . we estimated the values of key infectionrelated quantities that determine the course of natural infection from viral load data , using markov chain monte carlo methods . the data were placebo group viral load measurements collected during volunteer challenge studies , conducted by roche , as part of the oseltamivir trials . we calculated the values of the quantities for each patient and the correlations between the quantities , symptom severity and body temperature . the greatest variation among individuals occurred in the viral load peak and area under the viral load curve . total symptom severity correlated positively with the basic reproductive number . the most sensitive endpoint for therapeutic trials with the goal to cure patients is the duration of infection . we suggest laboratory experiments to obtain more precise estimates of virological quantities that can supplement clinical endpoint measurements .

0e8767d1dfd2b5c7ea2a1abd29d808ed41839662	tightly packed complexes of nucleocapsid protein and genomic rna form the core of viruses and may assemble within viral factories , dynamic compartments formed within the host cells . here , we examine the possibility that the multivalent rna - binding nucleocapsid protein ( n ) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov-2 ) compacts rna via protein - rna liquid - liquid phase separation ( llps ) and that n interactions with host rna - binding proteins are mediated by phase separation . to this end , we created a construct expressing recombinant n fused to a nterminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric n soluble for purification . using in vitro phase separation assays , we find that n is assembly - prone and phase separates avidly . phase separation is modulated by addition of rna and changes in ph and is disfavored at high concentrations of salt . furthermore , n enters into in vitro phase separated condensates of full - length human hnrnps ( tdp-43 , fus , and hnrnpa2 ) and their low complexity domains ( lcs ) . however , n partitioning into the 2 lc of fus , but not tdp-43 or hnrnpa2 , requires cleavage of the solubilizing mbp fusion . hence , llps may be an essential mechanism used for sars - cov-2 and other rna viral genome packing and host protein co - opting , functions necessary for viral replication and hence infectivity . 
0e8c94d742f86efea638ceadf11213a809402f95	an epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in northern italy with a strong contagion rate . we implement an seir model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic . the example may ideally regard the situation in the italian region of lombardy , where the epidemic started on february 24 , but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters , namely , the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time , the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people , the incubation and infectious periods , and the fatality rate . first , we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions ( in order for the epidemic to start , there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human ) . then , we consider the lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date ( may 5 , 2020 ) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature . the peak occurs at day 37 ( march 31 ) approximately , with a reproduction ratio r 0 of 3 initially , 1.36 at day 22 , and 0.8 after day 35 , indicating different degrees of lockdown . the predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties , with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic . the incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days , and the infectious period is 4 days , with a fatality rate of 0.00144 / day [ values based on the reported ( official ) number of casualties ] . the infection fatality rate ( ifr ) is 0.57 % , and it is 2.37 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed . however , these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals . if approximately nine times more individuals are exposed , there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and ifr = 0.47 % . if we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods , we observe that a higher incubation period ( 13 vs. 4.25 days ) gives the same ifr ( 0.6 vs. 0.57 % ) , but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case . other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data , but some of the results may not be realistic . therefore , an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters . besides the specific example , carcione et al . modeling the covid-19 epidemic the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures , social distancing , and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic . hence , it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown . 
0ecc36ef369e1d2b3f2d1b00e66123c9e089d98d	african swine fever virus ( asfv ) is a large double - stranded dna virus responsible for a lethal pig disease , to which no vaccine has ever been obtained . its genome encodes a number of proteins involved in virus survival and transmission in its hosts , in particular proteins that inhibit signaling pathways in infected macrophages and , thus , interfere with the host 's innate immune response . a recently identified novel asfv viral protein ( pi329l ) was found to inhibit the toll - like receptor 3 ( tlr3 ) signaling pathway , tlr3 being a crucial ' ' danger detector . ' ' pi329l has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing extracellular putative leucine - rich repeats similar to tlr3 , suggesting that pi329l might act as a tlr3 decoy . to explore this idea , we used comparative modeling and other structure prediction protocols to propose ( a ) a model for the tlr3-toll - interleukin-1 receptor homodimer and ( b ) a structural fold for pi329l , detailed at atomistic level for its cytoplasmic domain . as this later domain shares only remote sequence relationships with the available tlr3 templates , a more complex modeling strategy was employed that combines the iterative implementation of ( multi)threading / assembly / refinement ( i - tasser ) structural prediction with expertise - guided posterior refinement . the final pi329l model presents a plausible fold , good structural quality , is consistent with the available experimental data , and it corroborates our hypothesis of pi329l being a tlr3 antagonist .

12c3660c37af4a311a3a14667a12ce48388dd6ce	under a traditional paradigm , only those with the expected background knowledge consume academic literature . the lay press , as well as government and non - government agencies , play a complementary role of extracting findings of high interest or importance and translating them for general viewing . the need for accurate reporting and public advising is paramount when attempting to tackle epidemic outbreaks through behavior change . yet , public trust in media outlets is at a historic low . the crisis and emergency risk communication ( cerc ) model for media reporting on public health emergencies was established in 2005 and has subsequently been used to analyze media reporting on outbreaks of influenza and measles as well as smoking habits and medication compliance . however , no media analysis had yet been performed on the 2013 - 2016 ebola virus disease ( evd ) outbreak . this study compared the evd information relayed by lay press sources with general review articles in the academic literature through a mixed - methods analysis . these findings suggest that comprehensive review articles could not serve as a source to clarify and contextualize the uncertainties around the evd outbreak , perhaps due to adherence to technical accuracy at the expense of clarity within the context of outbreak conditions . this finding does not imply inferiority of the academic literature , nor does it draw direct causation between confusion in review articles and public misunderstanding . given the erosion of the barriers siloing academia , combined with the demands of today 's fast - paced media environment , contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions to best serve as a source of clarity .

1409c72e99d3620128d50cb0704cbbdcf723ebc0	covid-19 has circled the globe , rapidly expanding from an outbreak in china to a pandemic in a matter of weeks . lacking an effective vaccine or proven , pharmaceutical therapy , countries have enacted an unprecedented series of non - pharmaceutical interventions to combat this disease . however , the potential for variation in free - living virus survival to modulate the efficacy of these interventions remains unclear . using an empirically determined understanding of sars - cov-2 natural history and detailed , country - level case data , we elucidate how variation in free - living virus survival influences key features of covid-19 epidemics . our findings suggest that covid-19 's basic reproductive number ( ℛ0 ) and other key signatures of outbreak intensity are modulated by transmission between infected individuals and the environment . in addition , country - level outbreaks vary in the degree to which environmental transmission appears to modulate covid-19 dynamics . summarizing , we propose that informed models of " sit and wait , " environmental transmission are essential in emerging outbreaks , as they highlight how variation in environmental transmission may explain observed differences in disease dynamics from setting to setting , and can inform public health interventions .

185e7951aa39e6b82e6712ce2ddf40266e67da88	influenza causes seasonal outbreaks yearly and unpredictable pandemics with high morbidity and mortality rates . despite significant efforts to address influenza , it remains a major threat to human public health . this issue is partially due to the lack of antiviral drugs with potent antiviral activity and broad reactivity against all influenza virus strains and the rapid emergence of drug - resistant variants . moreover , designing a universal influenza vaccine that is sufficiently immunogenic to induce universal antibodies is difficult . some novel epitopes hidden in the hemagglutinin ( ha ) trimeric interface have been discovered recently , and a number of antibodies targeting these epitopes have been found to be capable of neutralizing a broad range of influenza isolates . these findings may have important implications for the development of universal influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs . in this review , we focused on the antibodies targeting these newly discovered epitopes in the ha domain of the influenza virus to promote the development of universal anti - influenza antibodies or vaccines and extend the discovery to other viruses with similar conformational changes in envelope proteins .

( 2019 ) recently simulated 18 the evaporation of large droplets ( 20 - 80 μm ) in a simplified 2d industrial building with 19 different ambient temperature and rh conditions . water droplets were employed to 20 represent the industrial airborne pollutants in the form of droplets . furthermore , yang et 21 to quantitatively measure the bio - aerosol transmission , accurate prediction for the 1 deposition of inhaled droplets / particles is essential . deposition of inhalable 2 droplets / particles is commonly dominated by three mechanisms , i.e. , inertial impaction 3 ( kim & fisher , 1999 ) , sedimentation ( chen , feng , et al . , 2018 ; kleinstreuer et al . , 4 2007 ) , and diffusion ( zamankhan et al . , 2006 ) . diffusion , i.e. , brownian motion , has a 5 limited effect on micron droplets / particles ( clement kleinstreuer et al . , 2008 ) . the 6 hygroscopic growth of the droplet / particle increases the diameter and mass of the 7 droplet / particle . therefore , it may further affect the droplet / particle deposition via these 8 three deposition mechanisms . the hygroscopic growth of the droplet / particle is determined by the water vapor 10 concentration distribution in the airway . however , the water vapor concentration 11 distribution is not only determined by rhs in the ambient air , but also influenced by the 12 evaporation rate of the mucus layer that covers the airway . wu et al . ( 2014 ) proposed a 13 numerical method using two domains , i.e. , a mucus - tissue layer and an airway lumen 14 domain , to predict the temperature and rh distributions in the airway . we recently 15 developed a similar method for predicting the deposition of hygroscopic droplets in a 16 mouth - throat ( mt ) airway geometry with an inhalation flow rate equal to 15 l / min 17 ( chen , kleinstreuer , et al . , 2018 ) . the numerical predictions suggested that inhaled 18 thermal airflow and mucus - layer interaction could significantly reduce hygroscopic 19 growth , and thereby decrease the deposition efficiency ( de ) of multi - component 20 droplets up to 10 % compared to the de , using the constant 37 ° c and 99.5 % rh as the 21 3 . numerical investigation of 9 the interaction , transport and deposition of multicomponent droplets in a 10 simple mouth - throat model .

1963efabf6787b33386d7589664bd108ad7f01ba	we identified novel viruses in feces from cattle with diarrhea collected in 2009 in hokkaido prefecture , japan , by using a metagenomics approach and determined the ( near ) complete sequences of the virus . sequence analyses revealed that they had a standard picornavirus genome organization , i.e. 5 untranslated region ( utr ) -lutr - poly(a ) . they are closely related to other unclassified chinese picornaviruses ; bat picornaviruses group 1 - 3 , feline picornavirus , and canine picornavirus , sharing 45.4 - 51.4 % ( p1 ) , 38.0 - 44.9 % ( p2 ) , and 49.6 - 53.3 % ( p3 ) amino acid identities , respectively . the phylogenetic analyses and detailed genome characterization showed that they , together with the unclassified chinese picornaviruses , grouped as a cluster for the p1 , 2c , 3cd and vp1 coding regions . these viruses had conserved features ( e.g. predicted protein cleavage sites , presence of a leader protein , 2a , 2c , 3c , and 3d functional domains ) , suggesting they have a common ancestor . reverse - transcription - pcr assays , using specific primers designed from the 5 utr sequence of these viruses , showed that 23.0 % ( 20/87 ) of fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea were positive , indicating the prevalence of these picornavirus in the japanese cattle population in hokkaido prefecture . however , further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic potential and etiological role of these viruses in cattle . 
19fc55dbef34b03dd94cad3565cf48628bfbe842	introduction : the aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of immunoglobulin m ( igm ) during the different stages of sepsis . methods : in this prospective multicenter study , blood sampling for igm measurement was done within the first 24 hours from diagnosis in 332 critically ill patients ; in 83 patients this was repeated upon progression to more severe stages . among these 83 patients , 30 patients with severe sepsis progressed into shock and igm was monitored daily for seven consecutive days . peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) were isolated from 55 patients and stimulated for igm production . results : serum igm was decreased in septic shock compared to patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) and patients with severe sepsis . paired comparisons at distinct time points of the sepsis course showed that igm was decreased only when patients deteriorated from severe sepsis to septic shock . serial measurements in these patients , beginning from the early start of vasopressors , showed that the distribution of igm over time was significantly greater for survivors than for non - survivors . production of igm by pbmcs was significantly lower at all stages of sepsis compared with healthy controls . conclusions : specific changes of circulating igm occur when patients with severe sepsis progress into septic shock . the distribution of igm is lower among non - survivors . 
1a80ce2336e72d0e9283afaf12e5d25255f4984e	severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) is caused by a novel coronavirus termed sars - cov. no antiviral treatment has been established so far . interferons are cytokines which induce the synthesis of several antivirally active proteins in the cell . in this study , we demonstrated that multiplication of sars - cov in cell culture can be strongly inhibited by pretreatment with interferon - beta . interferon - alpha and interferon - gamma , by contrast , were less effective . the human mxa protein is one of the most prominent proteins induced by interferon - beta . nevertheless , no interference with sars - cov replication was observed in vero cells stably expressing mxa. therefore , other interferon - induced proteins must be responsible for the strong inhibitory effect of interferon - beta against sars - cov. 
1aa091c222e1c37ab245b60ed6432ab597480149	infectious pathogens are known for their rapid evolutionary rates with new mutations arising over days to weeks . the ability to rapidly recover whole genome sequences and analyze the spread and evolution of pathogens using genetic information and pathogen collection dates has lead to interest in real - time tracking of infectious transmission and outbreaks . however , the level of temporal resolution afforded by these analyses may conflict with definitions of what constitutes protected health information ( phi ) and privacy requirements for de - identification for publication and public sharing of research data and metadata . in the united states , dates and locations associated with patient care that provide greater resolution than year or the first three digits of the zip code are generally considered patient identifiers . admission and discharge dates are specifically named as identifiers in department of health and human services guidance . to understand the degree to which one can impute admission dates from specimen collection dates , we examined sample collection dates and patient admission dates associated with more than 270,000 unique microbiological results from the university of washington laboratory medicine department between 2010 and 2017 . across all positive microbiological tests , the sample collection date exactly matched the patient admission date in 68.8 % of tests . collection dates and admission dates were identical from emergency department and outpatient testing 86.7 % and 96.5 % of the time , respectively , with > 99 % of tests collected within 1 day from the patient admission date . samples from female patients were significantly more likely to be collected closer to admission date that those from male patients . we show that phi - associated dates such as admission date can confidently be imputed from deposited collection date . we suggest that publicly depositing microbiological collection dates at greater resolution than the year may not meet routine safe harbor - based requirements for patient de - identification . we recommend the use of expert determination to determine phi for a given study and/or direct patient consent if clinical laboratories or phylodynamic practitioners desire to make these data available . 
1ac29ed81f2c555635d5fb80ffe38913b07a6c21	recombinant canine coronaviruses , resembling the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine ( tgev ) in a 5 fragment of the s glycoprotein , have been detected recently and showed to be present in canine populations . the 5 fragment of the s protein ( s ) of a tgev - like canine coronavirus ( ccov ) , strain 174/06 , was expressed in an escherichia coli cell - free system . the purified recombinant polypeptide was employed to develop an elisa test for the detection of tgev - like ccov - specific antibodies in dog sera . four canine sera positive for tgev - like ccov , six sera positive to classical ccov - ii strains and 10 negative control sera were examined . the recombinant s was not recognized by antibodies to classical ccov - ii , as only sera from dogs infected experimentally with tgev - like ccov reacted strongly with the recombinant s polypeptide whereas dog sera with antibodies to classical ccov - ii did not react . as classical ccov - ii and tegv - like ccovs are related antigenically , the recombinant s elisa is a useful method to investigate serologically the prevalence of tgev - like ccovs in dogs . 
1ac9aac4ecdf40363f1377cc08484db3dc4abf93	this study compared the performances of three commercial transmissible gastroenteritis virus / porcine respiratory coronavirus ( tgev / prcv ) blocking enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisas ) using serum samples ( n ϭ 528 ) collected over a 49-day observation period from pigs inoculated with tgev strain purdue ( n ϭ 12 ) , tgev strain miller ( n ϭ 12 ) , prcv ( n ϭ 12 ) , or with virus - free culture medium ( n ϭ 12 ) . elisa results were evaluated both with " suspect " results interpreted as positive and then as negative . all commercial kits showed excellent diagnostic specificity ( 99 to 100 % ) when testing samples from pigs inoculated with virus - free culture medium . however , analyses revealed differences between the kits in diagnostic sensitivity ( percent tgev - or prcvseropositive pigs ) , and all kits showed significant ( p ͻ 0.05 ) cross - reactivity between tgev and prcv serum antibodies , particularly during early stages of the infections . serologic cross - reactivity between tgev and prcv seemed to be tgev strain dependent , with a higher percentage of prcv - false - positive results for pigs inoculated with tgev purdue than for tgev miller . moreover , the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive , regardless of the elisa kit evaluated . importance current measures to prevent tgev from entering a naive herd include quarantine and testing for tgev - seronegative animals . however , tgev serology is complicated due to the cross - reactivity with prcv , which circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide . conventional serological tests can not distinguish between tgev and prcv antibodies ; however , blocking elisas using antigen containing a large deletion in the amino terminus of the prcv s protein permit differentiation of prcv and tgev antibodies . several commercial tgev / prcv blocking elisas are available , but performance comparisons have not been reported in recent research . this study demonstrates that the serologic cross - reactivity between tgev and prcv affects the accuracy of commercial blocking elisas . individual test results must be interpreted with caution , particularly in the event of suspect results . therefore , commercial tgev / prcv blocking elisas should only be applied on a herd basis .

1b22cceade80fa373b77989b1b82599b179ea1e7	many traditional vaccines have proven to be incapable of controlling newly emerging infectious diseases . they have also achieved limited success in the fight against a variety of human cancers . thus , innovative vaccine strategies are highly needed to overcome the global burden of these diseases . advances in molecular biology and reverse genetics have completely restructured the concept of vaccinology , leading to the emergence of state - of - the - art technologies for vaccine design , development and delivery . among these modern vaccine technologies are the recombinant viral vectored vaccines , which are known for their incredible specificity in antigen delivery as well as the induction of robust immune responses in the vaccinated hosts . although a number of viruses have been used as vaccine vectors , genetically engineered newcastle disease virus ( ndv ) possesses some useful attributes that make it a preferable candidate for vectoring vaccine antigens . here , we review the molecular biology of ndv and discuss the reverse genetics approaches used to engineer the virus into an efficient vaccine vector . we then discuss the prospects of the engineered virus as an efficient vehicle of vaccines against cancer and several infectious diseases of man and animals . viruses 2020 , 12 , 451 2 of 23 the inactivated vaccines , which are known to be incredibly safe as a result of their non - replicating nature , but are often poorly immunogenic and therefore , do not elicit a long lasting immunity [ 6 ] . furthermore , both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have failed to effectively curb the menace of a variety of major global pathogens . these limitations altogether quest for the need to develop novel vaccine strategies that could potentially overcome the weaknesses of the conventional vaccines . interestingly , the recent advancements in molecular genetics and bioinformatics have paved way for the emergence of next generation vaccine technologies such as synthetic peptides , dna vaccines , recombinant viral - vectored vaccines , and reverse genetics - based vaccines , which are all currently on the path of revolutionizing medical and veterinary vaccinology [ 7 , 8 ] . newcastle disease virus is one of the most important avian viral pathogens that inflict huge economic losses in the global poultry industry [ 9 ] . the virus is highly genetically diverse , with currently more than 20 phylogenetically distinct genotypes based on the recently proposed ndv taxonomy criteria [ 10 ] . following the recovery of the first strain of the virus by reverse genetics 20 years ago [ 11 ] , tremendous progress has been recorded in the genetic manipulation of various strains of the virus . so far , ndv has been engineered to express rationally designed , safe and highly stable protective antigens against several human and animal pathogens ( table 1 ) . the virus has also been genetically reprogrammed for improved oncolytic efficacy against a variety of human cancers ( table 2 ) . thus , the prospects of genetically engineered ndv in the era of modern vaccinology can not be over emphasized . in this review , we start by describing the molecular biology of ndv and the various approaches used in the genetic manipulation of the virus for effective vaccine delivery . we then discuss the potentials of the engineered virus as a vaccine against cancer and other life threatening diseases in man and against economically important viruses in various domestic animals . newcastle disease virus ultrastructurally , the particles of ndv are pleomorphic in shape with diameters ranging from 100 - 500 nm . they essentially consist of the ribonucleoprotein ( rnp ) surrounded by the viral envelop with its surface glycoproteins that project as spikes . the rnp is made up of the rna genome completely encapsidated by a protein called nucleocapsid protein ( np ) . other proteins associated with the rnp include the large protein ( l ) , which is the rna - dependent rna polymerase and its co - factor , the phosphoprotein ( p ) [ 12 ] . together , they form a helical structure surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelop with surface projections of hemagglutinin - neuraminidase ( hn ) and fusion proteins ( f ) . the matrix protein ( m ) is found just beneath the viral envelop and maintains the shape and structure of the virion [ 13 ] . the genome of ndv is either 15,198 , 15,192 or 15,186 bp in size [ 14 ] . it is a single stranded , non - segmented negative sense rna that consists of leader ( 55 nucleotides ) and trailer ( 114 nucleotides ) terminal sequences separated by six genes in the order 3 -np - p - m - f - hn - l-5 . these terminal sequences are highly conserved across most of the paramyxoviruses [ 12,15 ] and house the regulatory signals for virus replication [ 16 ] . in addition , each gene in the ndv genome encodes a single protein and is characterized by having a coding sequence flanked by highly conserved gene start ( gs ) and a gene end ( ge ) transcriptional signals [ 17 ] . these features of ndv genome are shared by most of the paramyxoviruses , suggesting a common transcription and replication strategy . using reverse genetics , rnp associated viral structural proteins ( np , p and l ) have been shown to collectively contribute to ndv virulence . experiments involving the swapping of np between pathogenically different strains revealed a change in virulence of the generated recombinant virus only when np along with its other replication proteins partners ( p and l ) were swapped together [ 18 ] . notably , the np encapsidates the entire genomic rna while the l functions as an rna - dependent viruses 2020 , 12 , 451 3 of 23 rna polymerase that binds to p protein and forms a complex that recognizes the rnp for initiating the process of transcription and replication [ 19 ] . recent evidence has indicated that the l protein can significantly contribute to ndv virulence through its role in virus replication [ 20 ] . however , specific regions within the l protein responsible for determining ndv virulence are yet to be discovered . the f protein is the major determinant of ndv virulence . it is synthesized in an inactive form , f 0 , and then becomes activated following its proteolytic cleavage into f1 and f2 . the enzyme involved in the cleavage is determined by the amino acid composition of the cleavage site , which in turn varies in virulent and avirulent ndv strains [ 21 ] . avirulent pathotypes generally have a monobasic f cleavage site acted upon by extracellular trypsin like proteases . on the other hand , the virulent strains have multiple basic amino acid residues at their cleavage sites that are activated by intracellular proteases of the furin family [ 22 ] . in addition to the cleavage site 's amino acid composition , the sites of post translational modifications , notably glycosylation sites , may play a significant role in the virus virulence . recently , [ 23 ] observed an increase in virus virulence following deletion of n glycans from the heptad repeats of the ndv f protein . furthermore , [ 24 ] showed a dramatic increase in ndv virulence when the cytoplasmic tail from a mesogenic strain was used to replace its counterparts in another lentogenic strain , suggesting the possible role of the f protein 's cytoplasmic domain in determining the virulence of ndv . the hn protein is also believed to be a determinant of ndv virulence . depending on the location of the termination codon , the hn protein has several subtypes of varying length , with most of the avirulent strains encoding the longest protein made up of 616 amino acids . in contrast , the virulent strains encode the shortest hn proteins of about 571 amino acids . lentogenic strains such as lasota and b1 encode an hn protein of 577 amino acids in length [ 25 ] . other lengths of hn protein reported include 572 , 580 , 582 , and 585 amino acids . to investigate whether the hn length diversity is directly associated with the virus virulence , several ndv chimeras with shortened or extended hn length were generated by reverse genetics and tested for pathogenicity using standard procedures . it was revealed that varying the lengths of hn directly affects the functions related to viral replication but not pathogenicity [ 26 ] . v protein , a non - structural protein encoded by the p gene , also plays a vital role in determining ndv virulence . the role of v protein is clearly manifested during viral pathogenesis as an interferon antagonist , by selectively targeting stat-1 for degradation [ 27 ] . recombinant ndvs that can not express v protein often show no evidence of growth in 9 - 10 days chicken embryonated eggs and a very impaired growth in cell culture . those recombinant viruses also manifest sensitivity to exogenous interferon administration , indicating that the v protein plays a role in ndv replication and virulence [ 27 ] . collectively , virulence of ndv is determined by individual or collective roles of both structural and non - structural viral proteins . viruses 2020 , 12 , 451 16 of 23 are enormous . given its simple genome , efficient replication , host restriction , and non - pathogenicity in most mammals , ndv is likely to be the vector of choice against many other emerging diseases of man and domestic animals .

1c9b3aa2252e7d57adf0503f71d57f5bc17d49df	in december 2019 , a novel sars - cov-2 coronavirus emerged , causing an outbreak of lifethreatening pneumonia in the hubei province , china , and has now spread worldwide , causing a pandemic . the urgent need to control the disease , combined with the lack of specific and effective treatment modalities , call for the use of fda - approved agents that have shown efficacy against similar pathogens . chloroquine , remdesivir , lopinavir / ritonavir or ribavirin have all been successful in inhibiting sars - cov-2 in vitro . the initial results of a number of clinical trials involving various protocols of administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine mostly point towards their beneficial effect . however , they may not be effective in cases with persistently high viremia , while results on ivermectin ( another antiparasitic agent ) are not yet available . interestingly , azithromycin , a macrolide antibiotic in combination with hydroxychloroquine , might yield clinical benefit as an adjunctive . the results of clinical trials point to the potential clinical efficacy of antivirals , especially remdesivir ( gs-5734 ) , lopinavir / ritonavir , and favipiravir . other therapeutic options that are being explored j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f drożdżal et al . , clinically approved drugs … sars - cov-2 2 involve meplazumab , tocilizumab , and interferon type 1 . we discuss a number of other drugs that are currently in clinical trials , whose results are not yet available , and in various instances we enrich such efficacy analysis by invoking historic data on the treatment of sars , mers , influenza , or in vitro studies . meanwhile , scientists worldwide are seeking to discover novel drugs that take advantage of the molecular structure of the virus , its intracellular life cycle that probably elucidates unfolded - protein response , as well as its mechanism of surface binding and cell invasion , like angiotensin converting enzymes- , hr1 , and metalloproteinase inhibitors . 
1d9529d3a101773ad158072a13e23db5ea3f0054	humanitarian disasters have been on the rise in recent years due to the effects of climate change and socio - political situations such as the refugee crisis . technology can be used to best mobilize resources such as food and water in the event of a natural disaster , by semi - automatically flagging tweets and short messages as indicating an urgent need . the problem is challenging not just because of the sparseness of data in the immediate aftermath of a disaster , but because of the varying characteristics of disasters in developing countries ( making it difficult to train just one system ) and the noise and quirks in social media . in this paper , we present a robust , low - supervision social media urgency system that adapts to arbitrary crises by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in an ensemble setting . the system is also able to adapt to new crises where an unlabeled background corpus may not be available yet by utilizing a simple and effective transfer learning methodology . experimentally , our transfer learning and low - supervision approaches are found to outperform viable baselines with high significance on myriad disaster datasets . 
1dcbe701254463c23a49a37a43be95ce3b36f9bd	it has been 30 years since the passage of the americans with disabilities act and technological development has drastically changed the future for those with disabilities . as healthcare evolves toward promoting telehealth and patient - centered care , leaders must embrace persons with disabilities and caregivers as valued partners in design and implementation , not as passive " end - users " . we call for a new era of inclusive innovation , a term proposed in this publication to describe accessible technological design for all . the next 30 years of the ada leading to year 2050 , should reflect a new era of access , whereby digital health surmounts geographic , social , and economic barriers toward an inclusive virtual society . 
1e4e1f0244348c74423087362d72302b3c213898	the original idea of profiling implies attacking one device with a leakage model generated from an " identical copy " , but this concept can not be always enforced . the leakage model is commonly generated with traces from an " open device " , assuming that a model which works for one device should work for another copy as well . in practice , applying a leakage model to a different copy of the same device ( commonly called portability ) is a hard problem to deal with , as intrinsic differences in the devices or the experimental setups used to obtain the traces cause behavioural variations which lead to an unsuccessful attack . in this paper we propose a novel similarity assessment technique that allows evaluators to quantify the differences among various copies of the same device . moreover , we support this technique with actual experiments to show that this metric is directly related to the portability issue . finally , we derive a method that improves the performance of template attacks . 
1e589559db60e302b6b89f8793cef61207496b07	respiratory virus infections ( rvis ) pose a threat to children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) . in this era of sensitive molecular diagnostics , the incidence and outcome of hsct recipients who are hospitalized with rvi ( h - rvi ) are not well described . a retrospective observational cohort of pediatric hsct recipients ( between january 2010 and june 2013 ) was assembled from 9 us pediatric transplant centers . their medical charts were reviewed for h - rvi events within 1 year after their transplant . an h - rvi diagnosis required respiratory signs or symptoms plus viral detection ( human rhinovirus / enterovirus , human metapneumovirus , influenza , parainfluenza , coronaviruses , and/or respiratory syncytial virus ) . the incidence of h - rvi was calculated , and the association of baseline hsct factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed . results . among 1560 hsct recipients , 259 ( 16.6 % ) acquired at least 1 h - rvi within 1 year after their transplant . the median age of the patients with an h - rvi was lower than that of patients without an h - rvi ( 4.8 vs 7.1 years ; p < .001 ) . among the patients with a first h - rvi , 48 % required some respiratory support , and 14 % suffered significant pulmonary sequelae . the all - cause and attributable case - fatality rates within 3 months of h - rvi onset were 11 % and 5.4 % , respectively . multivariate logistic regression revealed that h - rvi onset within 60 days of hsct , steroid use in the 7 days before h - rvi onset , and the need for respiratory support at h - rvi onset were associated with subsequent morbidity or death . conclusion . results of this multicenter cohort study suggest that h - rvis are relatively common in pediatric hsct recipients and contribute to significant morbidity and death . these data should help inform interventional studies specific to each viral pathogen . 
1e863993819f87abe5cee255ccb97d623838542a	background : bocaviruses are classified as a genus within the parvoviridae family of single - stranded dna viruses and are pathogenic in some mammalian species . two species have been previously reported in dogs , minute virus of canines ( mvc ) , associated with neonatal diseases and fertility disorders ; and canine bocavirus ( cbov ) , associated with respiratory disease . findings : in this study using deep sequencing of enriched viral particles from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis , necrotizing vasculitis , granulomatous lymphadenitis and anuric renal failure , we identified and characterized a novel bocavirus we named canine bocavirus 3 ( cnbov3 ) . the three major orfs of cnbov3 ( ns1 , np1 and vp1 ) shared less than 60 % aa identity with those of other bocaviruses qualifying it as a novel species based on ictv criteria . inverse pcr showed the presence of concatemerized or circular forms of the genome in liver . conclusions : we genetically characterized a bocavirus in a dog liver that is highly distinct from prior canine bocaviruses found in respiratory and fecal samples . its role in this animal 's complex disease remains to be determined . 
1e88d68fd702c8accc72cece9a8df345c64b0b8c	blockade of the ceacam1 signaling pathway has recently been implicated as a novel mechanism for cancer immunotherapy . cc1 , a mouse anti - ceacam1 monoclonal antibody ( mab ) , has been widely used as a pharmacological tool in preclinical studies to inform on ceacam1 pathway biology although limited data are available on its ceacam1 blocking characteristics or pharmacodynamic - pharmacokinetic profiles . we sought to investigate ceacam1 expression on mouse tumor and immune cells , characterize cc1 mab binding , and evaluate cc1 in syngeneic mouse oncology models as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti - pd-1 mab . ceacam1 expression was observed at high levels on neutrophils , nk cells and myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdscs ) , while the expression on tumor - infiltrating cd8 + t cells was low . unexpectedly , rather than blocking , cc1 facilitated binding of soluble ceacam1 to ceacam1 expressing cells . no anti - tumor effects were observed in ct26 , mbt2 or a20 models when tested up to 30 mg / kg dose , a dose that was estimated to achieve > 90 % target engagement in vivo . taken together , tumor infiltrating cd8 + t cells express low levels of ceacam1 and cc1 ab mediates no or minimal anti - tumor effects in vivo , as a monotherapy or in combination with anti - pd-1 treatment . 
1ee191cacc6d1a57595b53dca3f178fe34050079	overcrowding during the yearly hajj mass gatherings is associated with increased risk of spreading infectious diseases , particularly respiratory diseases . non - pharmaceutical interventions ( e.g. , hand hygiene , wearing face masks , social distancing ) are known to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses from person to person and are therefore recommended to pilgrims by public health agencies . the implementation of effective public health policies and recommendations involves evaluating the adherence to and effectiveness of these measures in the specific context of the hajj . this review summarizes the evidence related to the effectiveness of non - pharmaceutical interventions in preventing the spread of respiratory infectious diseases during the hajj . overall , although hand hygiene compliance is high among pilgrims , face mask use and social distancing remain difficult challenges . data about the effectiveness of these measures at the hajj are limited , and results are contradictory , highlighting the need for future large - scale studies . ª 
1ef1ae062aaf0d8a4f8cae27e51cf82cbbf88486	 the future of sustainable healthcare is built on distributed system in which stakeholders are organised into structured dynamic networks ;  cross - sectoral forums are needed to organise and facilitate collaborations and crossfertilisation within the value chain and in synergy with other sectors ;  a change in the role of policy - makers and policy instruments is needed to promote radical innovations that can accelerate the transition to sustainable healthcare ;  awareness - raising and knowledge - building strategies are crucial to boost the sustainable transitions of healthcare systems at the international level . over the past years , the interest in sustainable healthcare has been growing globally and the transition toward environmentally , economically and socially viable health systems is perceived as inevitable and necessary . all the approaches to this emerging field are mainly focusing on short - term specific issues and involving a limited number of stakeholders . this study aimed to address the topic of the possible futures of sustainable healthcare from a multi - stakeholder perspective , in order to define a long - term scenario and the key strategies to enhance this transition . a series of workshops have involved a representative selection of stakeholders based in nordic countries and concerned with sustainable healthcare ( health industries , health providers , managing authorities , universities and research centres , clusters , ngos and healthcare networks , professional consortia ) through a collaborative foresight process . a design - based approach has been adopted to investigate the current scenario and deepen foresight outcomes . the results highlighted three different horizons and the drivers to reshape the roles of individual stakeholders , enhancing the socio - technical transition towards a desirable scenario based on collaboration between distributed dynamic networks . the identified transition strategies move from the local to the international level , focusing on innovation , information and collaboration between stakeholders . this study provides the framework for future studies to deepen the transition process towards sustainable healthcare and its implications at nordics , european and international levels . j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 2 with massive budget deficits in public spending . this is leading to merging individual hospitals to increase cost - efficiency and exploit economies of scale while offering broader service ( deloitte , 2016 ) . new technologies play a key role in this new trend by optimising treatments procedures and enhancing the digital connection between hospitals and physicians . the need for keeping health costs down is also leading to increased transparency into care quality , results , and expenditure , due to mandatory or voluntary monitoring . secondly , healthcare has to face new health needs and find new and efficient ways to meet them . the population is ageing quickly , and by 2050 the number of persons over 60 years is expected to double , from 901 million to nearly 2.1 billion ( united nations , 2017 ) . population ageing puts pressure on health systems , increasing the demand for care , services , and technologies to prevent and treat noncommunicable diseases and chronic conditions associated with old age . overall , there is a shift toward chronic care : chronic noncommunicable diseases are responsible for 68 % of world 's deaths ( who , 2014 ) and account for over 70 % of healthcare spending in the us and european union ( gerteis et al . , 2014 ; busse et al . , 2010 ) . overall , the healthcare sector plays a significant economic role , by accounting , in the european union , for 10 % of gdp and 8 % of the total workforce . public expenditure on healthcare and long - term care is expected to increase , driven by high levels of public expenditure and debt in most countries , demographic pressures and technological advances . today , " the need to make health systems sustainable by making them more effective , accessible and resilient has been duly recognised by policy - makers at the eu and national level " ( european commission , 2016 ) and in the near future , policy actions will be needed to ensure longterm population health and care systems . this attention to regulations , policies and management practices of healthcare does not concern only europe . healthcare systems worldwide need to respond to these challenges , and healthcare stakeholders need to cooperate to face these new societal needs and move towards more sustainable systems . expenses and patient numbers will inevitably increase , and healthcare must pursue the goal of becoming more effective , more efficient , and more equitable for all people , by controlling spending , improving and implementing the use of available technology and engaging patients in prevention and self - care . the transition toward more resilient health systems is both delicate and complex , and it needs radical changes of perspective as regards the patients ' role and the systemic and multidisciplinary approach to healthcare . j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f promoting information campaigns targeted at decision - makers conducting information campaigns aimed at decision - makers to raise awareness of sh and the opportunities that are linked to this area national and regional authorities . defining the most appropriate communication methods to reach the target group . developing an international communication package on sh creating a multi - media communication package to disseminate topics and initiatives related to sh at an international level to increase global awareness .

1fe3f895e38e337398e1ab4c612339d3b8e72c90	targeted recombination was carried out to select mouse hepatitis viruses ( mhvs ) in a defined genetic background , containing an mhv - jhm spike gene encoding either three heptad repeat 1 ( hr1 ) substitutions ( q1067h , q1094h , and l1114r ) or l1114r alone . the recombinant virus , which expresses spike with the three substitutions , was nonfusogenic at neutral ph. its replication was significantly inhibited by lysosomotropic agents , and it was highly neuroattenuated in vivo . in contrast , the recombinant expressing spike with l1114r alone mediated cell - to - cell fusion at neutral ph and replicated efficiently despite the presence of lysosomotropic agents ; however , it still caused only subclinical morbidity and no mortality in animals . thus , both recombinant viruses were highly attenuated and expressed viral antigen which was restricted to the olfactory bulbs and was markedly absent from other regions of the brains at 5 days postinfection . these data demonstrate that amino acid substitutions , in particular l1114r , within hr1 of the jhm spike reduced the ability of mhv to spread in the central nervous system . furthermore , the requirements for low ph for fusion and viral entry are not prerequisites for the highly attenuated phenotype . 
20308c2a1349e993e82115a8dc869c011298dd06	influenza - like illness ( ili ) surveillance is important to identify circulating and emerging / reemerging strains and unusual epidemiological trends . the present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012 - 2013 ili outbreak in corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems : general practice , emergency general practice , hospital emergency units , intensive care units , and nursing homes . twenty - eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ili . sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses ( a(h1n1)pdm2009 , a(h3n2 ) and b ) was performed . the trends in ili / influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios ( rirs ) of having an ili consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed . of the 182 ili patients enrolled by general practitioners , 57.7 % tested positive for influenza viruses . phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza b and a(h3n2 ) viruses . the ili / influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated . in accordance with virological data , the rirs of having an ili consultation were highest among the young ( , 15 years old ) and decreased with age . no clusters of acute respiratory illness were declared by the sentinel nursing homes . this study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012 - 2013 ili outbreak in corsica as monitored through several surveillance systems . to improve ili surveillance in corsica , a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ili systems described here is being implemented . 
20488171771062895127afbb276541247cf2b0e0	in order to adapt random forests to the dynamic nature of data streams , the state - of - the - art technique discards trained trees and grows new trees when concept drifts are detected . this is particularly wasteful when recurrent patterns exist . in this work , we introduce a novel framework called pearl , which uses both an exact technique and a probabilistic graphical model with lossy counting , to replace drifted trees with relevant trees built from the past . the exact technique utilizes pattern matching to find the set of drifted trees , that co - occurred in predictions in the past . meanwhile , a probabilistic graphical model is being built to capture the tree replacements among recurrent concept drifts . once the graphical model becomes stable , it replaces the exact technique and finds relevant trees in a probabilistic fashion . further , lossy counting is applied to the graphical model which brings an added theoretical guarantee for both error rate and space complexity . we empirically show our technique outperforms baselines in terms of cumulative accuracy on both synthetic and real - world datasets .

221aab6d1b17b44bcfe5673d55d95f8a6d5d3b90	covid-19 pandemia is a major concern for patients and healthcare systems . the fear of infection by patients with concomitant rheumatic diseases ( either adult or children ) and connective tissue diseases is arising worldwide , because of their immunological background and immunological therapies . analysing the basic biology of single diseases , the data suggest that there is an " immunological umbrella " that seems to protect against the infection , through ifn type 1 and nk cell function . to date , reports from china , united states and europe did not reveal an higher risk of infection , either for rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile idiopathic arthritis nor for lupus erythematosus . antimalarials , anti - il6-anti - il6 receptor , anti - il1 , anti - gm - csf receptor and jak1/2/3 inhibitors , are under investigation in covid - dedicated clinical trials to control the inflammation raised by sars - cov-2 infection . initial reports on the occurrence of autoimmune phenomena in the convalescence phase of sars - cov-2 infection suggests that the immunological consequences of the infection need to be strictly understood . reporting of the study conforms to broad equator guidelines ( simera et al january 2010 issue of ejci ) . 
22aa3907c854fe265261d1950a68177bc90e2a83	we report a naturally occurring human astrovirus ( hastv ) strain detected in two different geographic locations . we identified two isolates of this strain in a diarrhea outbreak at a child care center in houston , texas ; and two isolates in diarrhea stool samples from two children in mexico city . all four isolates were detected in stool samples by enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) . one of the mexican isolates was typed by eia and all four isolates were hastv-5 by typing rt - pcr . the four isolates were > 97 % nucleotide - identical in two different genomic regions : orf1a ( 246nt ) , and the 3 end of the genome ( 471nt ) . one isolate from each geographic location was further sequenced in the transition region from orf1b to orf2 ( 1255nt ) and this region of the two isolates showed ≥ 99 % nt identity . phylogenetic analyses of sequences of eight hastv antigenic types and the novel strain in the transition region demonstrated the new strain being closely related to hastv-3 in orf1b , but closest to hastv-5 in orf2 . these results and high sequence identity among all hastv antigenic types in the transition region and rna structural predictions supported a potential recombination site at the orf1b / orf2 junction . this is the first evidence that recombination occurs among human astroviruses . 
22bbb20ac3f96141fe6f89bcc3fca37b4fd1f0f5	in response to the global pandemic of the last four months , some progress has been made in understanding the molecular - level host interactions of the new coronavirus sars - cov-2 responsible for covid-19 . however , when the virus enters the body it interacts not only with the host but also with the micro - organisms already inhabiting the host . understanding the virus - hostmicrobiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by the viral invasion . we carry out a comparative functional analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight covid-19 , twenty - five community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) patients and twenty healthy controls . the resulting functional profiles clearly separate the cohorts , even more sharply than just their corresponding taxonomic profiles . we also detect distinct pathway signatures in the respiratory tract microbiome that consistently distinguish covid-19 patients from both the cap and healthy cohorts . these include increased vitamin , drug , nucleotide , and energy metabolism during sars - cov-2 infection , contrasted with decreased amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism . this comparative analysis indicates consistent differences in covid-19 respiratory tract metatranscriptomes compared to cap and healthy samples .

2490a12ef4b700055d34bde4325a59ca90b8186e	porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) has caused economic losses in the americas , asia and europe in recent years . reliable serological assays are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation . the objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisas ) to detect antibodies against different pedv strains in pig serum . a total of 732 serum samples from north american or european pigs were tested . samples included experimental samples from pigs infected with classical ( g1a pedv ) or variant genogroup 1 pedv ( g1b pedv ) , pandemic genogroup 2 pedv ( g2b pedv ) or non - infected controls . field samples from herds with confirmed or unknown pedv exposure were also used . three indirect elisas based on g2b antigens ( elisas 1 , 2 and 3 ) , a competitive elisa based on the g2b antigen ( elisa 4 ) and a competitive elisa based on the g1a antigen ( elisa 5 ) were compared . overall , the tests had a moderate agreement ( = 0.61 ) . g1a pedv infected pigs were earliest detected by elisa 3 , g1b pedv infected pigs were earliest detected by elisas 4 and 5 and the performance of all tests was similar for the g2b pedv group . elisa 1 showed the overall lowest detection on experimentally and field derived samples . diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with a 95 % probability interval were estimated to be 68.2 % ( 62.1 - 74.4 % ) and 97.5 % ( 95.2 - 99.0 % ) for elisa 1 , 73.7 % ( 71.5 - 79.6 % ) and 98.4 % ( 96.6 - 99.5 % ) for elisa 2 , 86.2 % ( 81.1 - 90.6 % ) and 91.6 % ( 87.7 - 94.8 % ) for elisa 3 , 78.3 % ( 72.8 - 83.5 % ) and 99.7 % ( 98.2 - 100 % ) for elisa 4 , and 93.5 % ( 90.3 - 96.0 % ) and 91.2 % ( 83.8 - 97.9 % ) for elisa 5 . differences in detection among assays seem to be more related to intrinsic factors of an assay than to the pedv antigen used . 
24a61244c69f09bc9392bbbb4a97e881ee68dc5e	african swine fever virus ( asfv ) is a dsdna virus responsible for a severe , highly contagious , and lethal disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs . asfv has brought enormous economic loss to a number of countries , and effective vaccine and therapy are still lacking . therefore , a rapid , sensitive , and field - deployable detection of asfv is important for disease surveillance and control . herein , we developed a cas12a - mediated portable paper assay to rapidly and precisely detect asfv . we identified a robust set of crrnas that recognized the highly conserved region of essential asfv genes . the cas12a - mediated detection assay showed low tolerance for mismatch mutations , and no cross - reactivity against other common swine pathogens . we further developed a paper - based assay to allow instrument - free detection of asfv . specifically , we applied gold nanoparticle - antibody conjugate to engineer homemade strips and combined it with cas12a - mediated asfv detection . this portable paper , instrument - free diagnostics , faithfully detected asfv in swine samples , showing comparable sensitivity to the traditionally instrumentdependent qpcr method . taking together , we developed a highly sensitive , instant , and economic cas12a - mediated paper diagnostics of asfv , with a great application potential for monitoring asfv in the field .

24da9eb1bf5b54581deda2e999cd5058674ceac4	the bacterium tropheryma whipplei , which causes whipple disease in humans , is commonly detected in the feces of persons in africa . it is also associated with acute infections . we investigated the role of t. whipplei in febrile patients from 2 rural villages in senegal . during june 2010-march 2012 , we collected whole - blood finger - prick samples from 786 febrile and 385 healthy villagers . t. whipplei was detected in blood specimens from 36 ( 4.6 % ) of the 786 febrile patients and in 1 ( 0.25 % ) of the 385 apparently healthy persons . of the 37 t. whipplei cases , 26 ( 70.2 % ) were detected in august 2010 . familial cases and a potential new genotype were observed . the patients ' symptoms were mainly headache ( 68.9 % ) and cough ( 36.1 % ) . our findings suggest that t. whipplei is a cause of epidemic fever in senegal . 
253c524bd6c14b1df0a6340e310672113d359991	the 2014 ebola crisis has highlighted public - health vulnerabilities in liberia , sierra leone , and guinea - countries ravaged by extreme poverty , deforestation and mining - related disruption of livelihoods and ecosystems , and bloody civil wars in the cases of liberia and sierra leone . ebola 's emergence and impact are grounded in the legacy of colonialism and its creation of enduring inequalities within african nations and globally , via neoliberalism and the washington consensus . recent experiences with new and emerging diseases such as sars and various strains of hn influenzas have demonstrated the effectiveness of a coordinated local and global public health and education - oriented response to contain epidemics . to what extent is international assistance to fight ebola strengthening local public health and medical capacity in a sustainable way , so that other emerging disease threats , which are accelerating with climate change , may be met successfully ? this chapter considers the wide - ranging socio - political , medical , legal and environmental factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of ebola , with particular emphasis on the politics of the global and public health response and the role of gender , social inequality , colonialism and racism as they relate to the mobilization and establishment of the public health infrastructure required to combat ebola and other emerging diseases in times of climate change . the ebola crisis of 2014 - 2015 holds a number of lessons regarding global preparedness to meet the challenges posed by emerging diseases in times of climate change . these lessons relate to the causes and origins of the ebola spread , the initial responses to the epidemic at the local level , international responses and their longterm effects , and global disparities in health access . this chapter brings together a range of facts and commentary about the ebola epidemic , focusing on the role of climate change in exacerbating socio - economic vulnerabilities , and extending the discussion and analysis to future / emerging diseases and their relation to global climate change . by combining discourse analysis and sources of public information about the ebola crisis such as newspapers and online sources with statistics and academic analyses of local health systems , global institutions , climate change - induced weather patterns , social institutions , public opinion , economic trends , investment and urbanization , we present an interdisciplinary contextual analysis of emergent pressures on local health systems in times of climate change , with global implications . while direct causality among factors is nearly impossible to " prove " in complex circumstances such as this , systems researchers rely on such triangulation and multiple evidence - based methodologies to track trends and make sense of emergent linked phenomena ( klenk and meehan 2015 ; poteete et al . 2010 ; roe 1998 ; moran - ellis et al . 2006 ) . the literature on hazards and disasters distinguishes between the former as being a precondition ( in the form of a hazardous agent or circumstance ) to a disaster . a hazard is therefore a disaster waiting to happen . hazardous conditions set the stage for a disaster to occur . in the case of ebola , the hazardous agent is the virus itself . the virus itself does not in itself " cause " the outbreak , just as a hazard in itself does not " cause " the disaster . rather , the social , political , cultural , economic and biophysical conditions and factors we write about in this chapter all contributed to enabling the disease to spread . here the enablement of disease spread also , notably , extends to the outbreak response , including how these numerous factors hindered the outbreak response . the following section discusses the ebola epidemic 's roots in globalization , international trade pressures , financial flows , bretton woods institutions , incapacity and created weakness in african health - care systems , and the prospects for addressing these inequities as climate change worsens . section 3 " ebola 's roots in extended urbanization " , gives more detail on how mining , transportation networks , urbanization , and the scale of environmental - economic transformations both in africa and worldwide lead to the conditions in which new diseases emerge and spread . in section 4 " health infrastructure , climate change , and ebola 's spread " , photos and statistics demonstrate the relationship between climate change , poverty ,

25fcf9b7042d134127c272d27f5a4dda16e0c5ff	currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear . it is believed that once rabv enters the central nervous system ( cns ) , virus neutralizing antibodies ( vnas ) in the periphery can not pass through the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) and into the cns . furthermore , it has been hypothesized that vnas produced in the cns by invading b cells , rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the cns , are important in clearing rabv from the cns . in the present study , mouse serum containing vna was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild - type rabv . our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of vnas is crucial in the clearance of rabv from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the bbb permeability remains enhanced . this present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing vna therapy for clinical rabies in humans .

265550669ed69c2cf7a7a76fe0a3bad644dbb8a8	parasites and pathogens are a fundamental driving force in the ecology and evolution of mammalian populations , and understanding disease processes in natural populations is an urgent priority in the face of increased rates of infectious disease emergence . in this review , we argue that mammalogists are uniquely placed to contribute to addressing these challenges because in - depth knowledge of mammal species is fundamental to the development of wild model systems that could accelerate discovery in disease ecology . the use of animal models - species for which a broad range of diagnostic , molecular , and genetic tools have been developed - in tightly controlled laboratory environments has been instrumental in driving progress in the biomedical sciences . however , in natural populations , disease processes operate in the context of enormous genetic , phenotypic , and environmental variability . understanding diseases in animal populations ( including humans ) thus requires investment in " wild animal models " that explicitly include individual variation and relevant environmental gradients . wild mammal groups such as primates and rodents have already been identified as potentially useful models of infectious diseases in the wild . here , we discuss the enormous potential that ungulates hold as candidates for wild model systems . the diversity , broad geographic distribution , and often high abundance of species in this group make them a highly accessible target for disease research . moreover , a depth of background knowledge , close relationships to domesticated animals , and ongoing management of many wild ungulate species provide context , tools , and opportunity for cutting - edge research at the interface of ecological and biomedical sciences . studies of wild ungulates are already helping to unravel some key challenges in infectious disease research , including the role of parasites in trophic cascades , the consequences of climate change for disease dynamics , and the systems biology of host - parasite interactions . other areas where ungulate studies may provide new insight include research on the sources and drivers of emerging infectious diseases . 
26e08ced295167f38992debd4d79a410624d6485	waterborne enteric viruses are an emerging cause of disease outbreaks and represent a major threat to 23 global public health . enteric viruses may originate from human wastewater and can undergo rapid 24 transport through aquatic environments with minimal decay . surveillance and source apportionment of 25 enteric viruses in environmental waters is therefore essential for accurate risk management . however , 26 individual monitoring of the > 100 enteric viral strains that have been identified as aquatic contaminants is 27 unfeasible . instead , viral indicators are often used for quantitative assessments of wastewater 28 contamination , viral decay and transport in water . an ideal indicator for tracking wastewater 29 contamination should be ( i ) easy to detect and quantify , ( ii ) source - specific , ( iii ) resistant to wastewater 30 treatment processes , and ( iv ) persistent in the aquatic environment , with similar behaviour to viral 31 pathogens . here , we conducted a comprehensive review of 127 peer - reviewed publications , to critically 32 evaluate the effectiveness of several viral indicators of wastewater pollution , including common enteric 33 viruses ( mastadenoviruses , polyomaviruses , and aichi viruses ) , the pepper mild mottle virus ( pmmov ) , and 34 gut - associated bacteriophages ( type ii / iii frna phages and phages infecting human bacteroides species , 35 including crassphage ) . our analysis suggests that overall , human mastadenoviruses have the greatest 36 potential to indicate contamination by domestic wastewater due to their easy detection , culturability , and 37 high prevalence in wastewater and in the polluted environment . aichi virus , crassphage and pmmov are 38 also widely detected in wastewater and in the environment , and may be used as molecular markers for 39 human - derived contamination . we conclude that viral indicators are suitable for the long - term monitoring 40 of viral contamination in freshwater and marine environments and that these should be implemented 41 within monitoring programmes to provide a holistic assessment of microbiological water quality and 42 wastewater - based epidemiology , improve current risk management strategies and protect global human 43 health . 44 45 
26efe2480c96d93ed23f8adf49ace5671c55d6d1	respiratory infections remain a common and serious complication of transplantation and chronic immunosuppressive therapy . manifestations are often more severe than in immunocompetent hosts and may be atypical . human herpesviruses ( hhvs ) cause a major burden of disease in patients with impaired immunity and cause a wide spectrum of disease , including pulmonary infection . in addition , epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) and hhv-8 are oncogenic viruses , and in certain settings , infection with these pathogens may evolve into malignancy that can include respiratory tract involvement . this review will focus on the epidemiology , clinical manifestations , treatment , and preventive strategies for infection by hhvs in immunocompromised persons , including hematopoietic cell transplant ( hct ) and solid organ transplant ( sot ) recipients . cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) , also known as hhv-5 , is a ubiquitous human dna virus of the subfamily β - herpesviridae . it typically infects individuals early in life , with rates of seropositivity varying from 40 % in industrialized countries to 100 % in some underdeveloped countries . 1,2 acute cmv infection in immunocompromised hosts such as sotor hct recipients and those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) not only causes direct morbidity and mortality , it may have widespread indirect effects on the host . 3 despite progress in the management of cmv infection , it remains a leading complication of transplantation , and prevention and treatment of active cmv can positively impact transplant outcomes . 4 among immunocompromised individuals , members of the human herpesviridae family are frequently encountered pathogens . cytomegalovirus , herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 , varicella zoster virus , epstein - barr virus , and human herpesvirus-6 , -7 , and -8 all establish latency after infection and can reactivate during periods of immunosuppression , leading to both direct and indirect adverse effects on the host including severe organ dysfunction as well as allograft rejection and loss after transplantation . while not all herpesviruses are primary respiratory pathogens , many of their manifestations include involvement of the respiratory tract . this article discusses the individual viruses , their epidemiology , and clinical manifestations as well as recommended treatment and preventive strategies . 
2864304d9d9f38db572ca1d8783df6c6bb94a970	this chapter outlines the widespread acceptance of speed as a positive aspect of urban transport during the 20th century , along with a growing recognition in recent decades that speed may not provide the advantages that have long been assumed . in 21st century urban planning , no longer are higher speeds always seen as the main objective . new goals are increasingly recognised as being more important : accessibility , liveability , economic vitality , child - friendliness , sustainability and health . the concept of ' health ' in this book applies to human health , as well as economic health and environmental health . we explain how all of these types of health can be enhanced using the simple strategy of slowing city transport . a brief history of increases in transport speed is followed by a discussion of the evolution of the culture of speed in modern societies , to a level that can be compared to an addiction . an important aspect of the culture of speed is the story of motordom , the grouping of automobile clubs , car dealers and car manufacturers that began in the united states in the 1920s . a concerted campaign by motordom comprehensively dismissed the public 's negative views on speed . we then outline how , from the 1980s onwards , new thinking began to emerge about motorised city transport , in which the value of slowing it down became more widely discussed . we provide examples of various slow movements that have emerged since the 1980s . while some citizens and policy - makers may question ( or even ridicule ) the idea of slow movements , we reflect on where the ' fast movement ' has taken us over the last 100 years . this chapter concludes with a preview of the chapters and parts of the book .

29bea86b0ba016595710141d2e9ad5775438fbfa	canada 's history of nation building , combined with its status as a so - called middle power in international affairs , has been translated into an approach to global health that is focused on equity and global citizenship . canada has often aspired to be a socially progressive force abroad , using alliance building and collective action to exert influence beyond that expected from a country with moderate financial and military resources . conversely , when canada has primarily used economic self - interest to define its global role , the country 's perceived leadership in global health has diminished . current prime minister justin trudeau 's liberal federal government has signalled a return to progressive values , driven by appreciation for diversity , equality , and canada 's responsibility to be a good global citizen . however , poor coordination of efforts , limited funding , and the unaddressed legacy of canada 's colonisation of indigenous peoples weaken the potential for canadians to make meaningful contributions to improvement of global health equity . amid increased nationalism and uncertainty towards multilateral commitments by some major powers in the world , the canadian federal government has a clear opportunity to convert its commitments to equity and global citizenship into stronger leadership on the global stage . such leadership will require the translation of aspirational messages about health equity and inclusion into concrete action at home and internationally . 
2a423f15be9162d939e0402df6f74c31ee2e9486	viruses are among the most common causes of opportunistic infection after transplantation . the risk for viral infection is a function of the specific virus encountered , the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection , and other host factors governing susceptibility . although cytomegalovirus is the most common opportunistic pathogen seen in transplant recipients , numerous other viruses have also affected outcomes . in some cases , preventive measures such as pretransplant screening , prophylactic antiviral therapy , or posttransplant viral monitoring may limit the impact of these infections . recent advances in laboratory monitoring and antiviral therapy have improved outcomes . studies of viral latency , reactivation , and the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections . this paper will summarize the major viral infections seen following transplant and discuss strategies for prevention and management of these potential pathogens . 
2aa4efa617a2ed9b62eecb177462d5609ca87aff	explicit theory axioms are added by a saturation - based theorem prover as one of the techniques for supporting theory reasoning . while simple and effective , adding theory axioms can also pollute the search space with many irrelevant consequences . as a result , the prover often gets lost in parts of the search space where the chance to find a proof is low . in this paper , we describe a new strategy for controlling the amount of reasoning with explicit theory axioms . the strategy refines a recently proposed two - layer - queue clause selection and combines it with a heuristic measure of the amount of theory reasoning in the derivation of a clause . we implemented the new strategy in the automatic theorem prover vampire and present an evaluation showing that our work dramatically improves the state - of - the - art clause - selection strategy in the presence of theory axioms .

2afcf2ab2330cb56ec493f82d87fa0c5b5f076e9	the ideal method to encourage uptake of clinical guidelines in hospitals is not known . several strategies have been suggested . this study evaluates the impact of academic detailing and a computerised decision support system ( cdss ) on clinicians ' prescribing behaviour for patients with community acquired pneumonia ( cap ) . the management of all patients presenting to the emergency department over three successive time periods was evaluated ; the baseline , academic detailing and cdss periods . the rate of empiric antibiotic prescribing that was concordant with recommendations was studied over time comparing pre and post periods and using an interrupted time series analysis . the odds ratio for concordant therapy in the academic detailing period , after adjustment for age , illness severity and suspicion of aspiration , compared with the baseline period was or = 2.79 [ 1.88 , 4.14 ] , p < 0.01 , and for the computerised decision support period compared to the academic detailing period was or = 1.99 [ 1.07 , 3.69 ] , p = 0.02 . during the first months of the computerised decision support period an improvement in the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing was demonstrated , which was greater than that expected to have occurred with time and academic detailing alone , based on predictions from a binary logistic model . deployment of a computerised decision support system was associated with an early improvement in antibiotic prescribing practices which was greater than the changes seen with academic detailing . the sustainability of this intervention requires further evaluation . 
2b66ed26516699b02d14bcf0d59671fb611f12ca	 the effects of climatology factors and population density on the infection rate of the covid 19 are investigated .  adaptive network - based fuzzy inference system ( anfis ) and virus optimization algorithms ( voa ) are used .  population density shows the most significant effect on the infection rate .  an increase in maximum temperature reduces the infection rate . recently , a novel coronavirus virus disease ( covid-19 ) has become a serious concern for global public health hazards . infectious disease outbreaks such as covid-19 can also 3 significantly affect the sustainable development of urban areas . several factors such as population density and climatology parameters could potentially affect the spread of the covid-19 . in this study , a combination of the virus optimization algorithm ( voa ) and adaptive network - based fuzzy inference system ( anfis ) to investigate the effects of various climaterelated factors and population density on the spread of the covid-19 . for this purpose , data on the climate - related factors and the confirmed infected cases by the covid-19 across the u.s counties was used . the results show that the variable defined for the population density had the most significant impact on the performance of the developed models , which is an indication of the importance social distancing in reducing the infection rate and spread rate of the covid-19 . among the climatology parameters , an increase in the maximum temperature was found to reduce the infection rate . average temperature , minimum temperature , precipitation , and average wind speed were not found to significantly affect the spread of the covid-19 while an increase in the relative humidity was found to slightly increase the infection rate . the findings of this research show that it could be expected to have reduced infection rate over the summer season . however , it should be noted that the models developed in this study were based on limited onemonth data . future investigation can benefit from using more comprehensive data covering a wider range for the input variables . 
2b7e25165c47ed61e78a9bfe6ede3028f3729a54	two full - length porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( prrsv ) genomes , strain vr-2332 and its cell culture passaged descendent respprrs vaccine strain , were compared and analyzed in order to identify possible sites of attenuation . of the 41 nucleotide changes , 12 resulted in conservative changes and 18 produced non - conservative changes . the results suggest that key amino acids in orf1 may contribute to the phenotype of respprrs , which includes increased growth rate on ma-104 cells and decreased virulence in swine . the results provide a genetic basis for future manipulation of a prrsv reverse genetics system . 
2bc3cdd87d1f68b7672f5b4033de824363c28604	available vaccines fail to induce lasting and protective immunity to equine herpesvirus 1 ( ehv-1 ) associated diseases . rna interference is a novel approach showing promise for therapeutic use in outbreak situations . this study examined the effect of small interfering rna ( sirna ) on clinical signs as well as the presence of live virus and viral dna in nasal secretions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) in horses experimentally infected with ehv-1 . sirna targeting two ehv-1 genes ( glycoprotein b and the origin binding protein ) was administered 12 h before and 12 h after intranasal infection with ehv-1 . control horses received sirna targeting firefly luciferase . a significantly smaller proportion ( 0/10 ) of horses receiving sirna targeting viral genes required euthanasia due to intractable neurologic disease as compared to horses in the control group ( 3/4 ; p = 0.01 ) . there was no significant difference in the presence of live virus or viral dna in the nasal secretions or pbmcs between the two groups . future studies are necessary to define the relative contributions of host and virus factors in the development of the neurological form of the infection and to determine an optimal dosing regimen for metaphylactic or therapeutic use of sirna for treating ehv-1 infection . 
2bd6e33d92632dfcba4056a2d7355ced5b7ab1fd	the outbreak of highly pathogenic h5n1 influenza in domestic poultry and wild birds has caused global concern over the possible evolution of a novel human strain [ 1 ] . if such a strain emerges , and is not controlled at source [ 2,3 ] , a pandemic is likely to result . health policy in most countries will then be focused on reducing morbidity and mortality . we estimate the expected reduction in primary attack rates for different household - based interventions using a mathematical model of influenza transmission within and between households . we show that , for lower transmissibility strains [ 2 , 4 ] , the combination of household - based quarantine , isolation of cases outside the household , and targeted prophylactic use of anti - virals will be highly effective and likely feasible across a range of plausible transmission scenarios . for example , for a basic reproductive number ( the average number of people infected by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population ) of 1.8 , assuming only 50 % compliance , this combination could reduce the infection ( symptomatic ) attack rate from 74 % ( 49 % ) to 40 % ( 27 % ) , requiring peak quarantine and isolation levels of 6.2 % and 0.8 % of the population , respectively , and an overall anti - viral stockpile of 3.9 doses per member of the population . although contact tracing may be additionally effective , the resources required make it impractical in most scenarios . national influenza pandemic preparedness plans currently focus on reducing the impact associated with a constant attack rate , rather than on reducing transmission . our findings suggest that the additional benefits and resource requirements of household - based interventions in reducing average levels of transmission should also be considered , even when expected levels of compliance are only moderate .

2dc623e0fed100b9e166ece1962fd0fb0b5cbeb5	hepatitis a virus ( hav ) 3c proteinase is a member of the picornain cysteine proteases responsible for the processing of the viral polyprotein , a function essential for viral maturation and infectivity . this and its structural similarity to other 3c and 3c - like proteases make it an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs . previous solution nmr studies have shown that a cys24ser ( c24s ) variant of hav 3c protein , which displays catalytic properties indistinguishable from the native enzyme , is irreversibly inactivated by n - benzyloxycarbonyl - l - serineb - lactone ( 1a ) through alkylation of the sulfur atom at the active site cys172 . however , crystallization of an enzyme - inhibitor adduct from the reaction mixture followed by x - ray structural analysis shows only covalent modification of the 32-nitrogen of the surface his102 by the b - lactone with no reaction at cys172 . re - examination of the heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence ( hmqc ) nmr spectra of the enzyme - inhibitor mixture indicates that dual modes of single covalent modification occur with a r3:1 ratio of s - alkylation of cys172 to n - alkylation of his102 . the latter product crystallizes readily , probably due to the interaction between the phenyl ring of the n - benzyloxycarbonyl ( n - cbz ) moiety and a hydrophobic pocket of a neighboring protein molecule in the crystal . furthermore , significant structural changes are observed in the active site of the 3c protease , which lead to the formation of a functional catalytic triad with asp84 accepting one hydrogen bond from his44 . although the 3c protease modified at cys172 is catalytically inactive , the singly modified his102 n 32 -alkylated protein displays a significant level of enzymatic activity , which can be further modified / inhibited by n - iodoacetyl - valinephenylalanine - amide ( ivf ) ( in solution and in crystal ) or excessive amount of the same b - lactone inhibitor ( in solution ) . the success of soaking ivf into hav 3c-1a crystals demonstrates the usefulness of this new crystal form in the study of enzyme - inhibitor interactions in the proteolytic active site . 
2dcddabe840e858d91d04286f71d69c184ec0d88	the coronavirus disease , covid-19 , caused by the novel coronavirus sars - cov-2 , which first emerged in wuhan , china and was made known to the world in december 2019 turned into a pandemic causing more than 126,124 deaths worldwide up to april 16th , 2020 . it has 79.5 % sequence identity with sars - cov-1 and the same strategy for host cell invasion through the ace-2 surface protein . since the development of novel drugs is a long - lasting process , researchers look for effective substances among drugs already approved or developed for other purposes . the 3d structure of the sars - cov-2 main protease was compared with the 3d structures of seven proteases , which are drug targets , and docking analysis to the sars - cov-2 protease structure of thirty four approved and on - trial protease inhibitors was performed . increased 3d structural similarity between the sars - cov-2 main protease , the hcv protease and α - thrombin was found . according to docking analysis the most promising results were found for hcv protease , dpp-4 , α - thrombin and coagulation factor xa known inhibitors , with several of them exhibiting estimated free binding energy lower than −8.00 kcal / mol and better prediction results than reference compounds . since some of the compounds are well - tolerated drugs , the promising in silico results may warrant further evaluation for viral anticipation . dpp-4 inhibitors with anti - viral action may be more useful for infected patients with diabetes , while anti - coagulant treatment is proposed in severe sars - cov-2 induced pneumonia . due to the urgent need for effective drugs to attenuate the disease , and the long - lasting process of novel drug development , researchers are focusing on " drug repositioning " . among the drugs approved or developed for other purposes that have been proposed for the treatment of sars - cov-2 and are under clinical trials , most are enzyme inhibitors , targeting the rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) or the protease of the virus . among them , favipinavir , ribavirin , remdesivir and galidesivir act as rdrp inhibitors while lopinavir , ritonavir [ 5,6 ] and danoprevir are viral protease inhibitors . in addition , drugs aiming to prevent the entrance and formation of the viral particles have been proposed , such as chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine [ 7 ] and apn01 [ 8 ] . lopinavir and ritonavir designed and approved for the treatment of aids were the first protease inhibitors used for the treatment of sars - cov-2 [ 5,6 ] . both drugs were proposed as promising agents for the treatment of sars - cov-1 by an in silico study conducted in 2016 which had evaluated the probable activity of several hiv-1 protease inhibitors against the sars - cov-1 protease using docking analysis [ 6 ] . the in silico results were promising , although coronavirus proteases are cysteine proteases while the hiv-1 protease belongs to the aspartate protease family [ 6 ] . upon release of the first sars - cov-2 main protease structure ( mpro ) to the protein data bank , on march 2020 , several in silico studies have been conducted to find potent protease inhibitors [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . the in silico - evaluated compounds were mostly approved drugs of all categories [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] , and natural plant [ 11 , 13 ] as well as marine [ 16 ] products . since docking analysis was performed , in most cases , in randomly selected approved drugs , independently of the rational of their initial design and their initial target , pharmaceutical agents of different drug categories have been proposed . among the most potent predicted inhibitors were anti - bacterial [ 10 , 19 ] , anti - fungal [ 10 ] , anti - viral [ 12 ] , anti - tuberculosis [ 12 ] , anti - nimatoid [ 17 ] , anti - protozoal [ 17 ] , anti - helminthic [ 19 ] , anti - inflammatory [ 19 ] , anti - tumor [ 10,12 ] , vasodilator [ 10 ] vasoprotective [ 12 ] , anti - convulsant [ 12 ] , bronchodilator [ 12 ] , anti - psychotic [ 10 ] agents and vitamins [ 12 ] . among the anti - viral agents are ribavirin , a nucleoside analogue used for the treatment of lassa fever virus , influenza a and b and hcv [ 12 ] ; telbivudine , a nucleoside analogue used for the treatment of hav [ 12 ] ; the hiv-1 integrase inhibitors raltegravir and dolutegravir [ 13 ] and the hiv-1 protease inhibitors , darunavir and saquinavir [ 14 ] . according to a more recent in silico research , published on april 15th , the hcv protease inhibitors , simeprevir and faldaprevir as well as the hiv-1 protease inhibitors indinavir and tipranavir along with saquinavir were predicted to act as better mpro inhibitors compared to the lopinavir and ritonavir used in clinical practice [ 15 ] . danoprevir was the first anti - hcv protease inhibitor which was approved for clinical trials ( clinical trial : nct04291729 ) . proteases are central enzymes in the biology of humans and viruses , and several of them have become drug targets for anti - viral therapy as well as for the treatment of various diseases . there is a number of approved drugs that act as protease inhibitors [ 20 ] . among the main proteolytic enzymes are the viral proteases of hiv-1 , with more than fifteen approved or on - trial drugs , and of hcv , with more than ten drugs . in addition , a number of drugs against human proteases have been developed . among them are renin inhibitors , with seven compounds and ace inhibitors , with more than twenty compounds with applications in the treatment of hypertension ; thrombin as well as coagulation factor xa inhibitors used as anti - thrombotic agents . dpp-4 inhibitors , gliptins , are used for the treatment of type ii diabetes , with seventeen drugs of this type mentioned in the who drugs stem book [ 21 ] . the above proteases belong to different classes according to the catalytic amino acid . while the sars - cov-2 main protease is a cysteine protease [ 20 , 22 ] , the hiv-1 enzyme is an aspartate protease [ 20 , 23 ] . the human drug target renin also belongs to this family . on the other hand , the hcv protease [ 24 ] as well as the human protease , the coagulation factor xa [ 26 ] and thrombin [ 27 ] are serine proteases , while the angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) belongs to the metalloproteinase family [ 20 , 28 ] .

3053529090a8974edc1ad695d3be4d407eef9674	background : in rats , urine - borne male pheromones comprise organic volatile compounds and major urinary proteins ( mups ) . a number of volatile pheromones have been reported , but no mup pheromones have been identified in rat urine . we used sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) , isoelectric focusing electrophoresis ( ief ) , nano - liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( nlc - ms / ms ) after in gel digestion of the proteins and quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) and showed that the levels of two mups , odorant - binding protein 3 ( obp3 ) ( i.e. pgcl4 ) and mup13 ( i.e. pgcl1 ) , in urine and their mrnas in liver were higher in males than in females and were suppressed by orchidectomy and restored by testosterone treatment ( t treatment ) . we then generated recombinant mups ( rmups ) and found that the sexual attractiveness of urine from castrated males to females significantly increased after the addition of either recombinant obp3 ( robp3 ) or recombinant mup13 ( rmup13 ) . using c - fos immunohistochemistry , we further examined neuronal activation in the brains of female rats after they sniffed robp3 or rmup13 . both robp3 and rmup13 activated the accessory olfactory bulb ( aob ) , medial preoptic area ( mpa ) , bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( bst ) , medial amygdala ( mea ) , posteromedial cortical amygdala ( pmco ) and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus ( vmh ) , which participate in the neural circuits responsible for pheromone - induced sexual behaviours . in particular , more c - fos - immunopositive ( c - fos - ir ) cells were observed in the posterior aob than in the anterior aob . conclusions : the expression of obp3 and mup13 was male - biased and androgen - dependent . they attracted females and activated brain areas related to sexual behaviours in female rats , suggesting that both obp3 and mup13 are male pheromones in rats . particularly , an obp excreted into urine was exemplified to be a chemical signal .

inflammatory cytokines production in macrophages and toxin - induced inflammation in mice . however , this drug has never been studied as a sepsis treatment method . we found that rolipram significantly improves survival in mice challenged with gram - negative bacterium e. coli , clp , or e. coli derived lipopolysaccharide . we have also found that rolipram inhibits organ damage , pro - inflammatory cytokine production , and intracellular migration of early - stage inflammatory elements . our results also show that rolipram increases anti - inflammatory cytokine production . the protective effects of rolipram on septic mice may result from inhibition of the map kinase and nf - κb signaling pathways . rolipram may therefore be a potential novel sepsis treatment , one that would bypass the time - consuming and costly drug - discovery process . sepsis is triggered by an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response to pathogenic microorganisms , and may lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mods ) and death . sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality , even under optimal conditions of critical care . it is the leading cause of death in non - coronary intensive care units 1 . the hospital case - fatality rate of severe sepsis patients has been estimated at approximately 25 % , while close to 50 % of septic shock patients die 2 . most importantly , the incidence of sepsis has risen by nearly 30 % in the past decade 3 . because sepsis can be induced by different microorganisms , vaccine development is difficult to impossible . moreover , the abuse of antibiotics in the hospital setting has induced drug resistance in common pathogens . therefore , despite enormous advancements in understanding the pathogenesis of sepsis , drug treatment remains largely ineffective . the identification , validation , and development of more effective drug treatments is extremely important . while sepsis can be induced by a number of traumatic and/or pathogenic events , it is commonly induced by a host inflammatory reaction to a number of different microbes and their products 3 - 6 . gram - negative bacteria are the leading cause of infection in both hospital - acquired and community - acquired infections . lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) is a major component of the gram - negative bacterial cell wall , and is itself the biggest player in induction of this antibacterial immune response 7 . lps induces inflammation by binding to toll - like receptor 4 on the host cell surface . upon activation of this receptor , the adaptor protein myd88 is recruited to the receptor , which in turn triggers a cascade of signaling events that leads to the transcription of the transcription factor nf - κb and the mitogen - activated protein ( map ) kinases . a subsequent series of downstream pro - inflammatory reactions leads to the expression of cytokines , chemokines , stress - responsive proteins , and other inflammatory elements 8 . nf - κb plays a pivotal role in the transcription of pro - inflammatory cytokines , including tumor necrosis factor α ( tnf - α ) , interleukin-1β ( il-1β ) , and il-6 . map kinases , including extracellular signal - related kinase ( erk ) , c - jun nh2-terminal kinase ( jnk ) , and p38 , also modulate cytokine expression at multiple levels . erk is required 1 open scientific reports | ( 2020 ) 10:175 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56899-6 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ for the transportation of tnf - α mrna from the nucleus to the cytoplasm 9 . p38 is a critical mediator of the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines , and has been identified as the target of a class of small - molecule inhibitors capable of inhibiting this process 10,11 . lps - induced transcription and translation of inflammatory mediators leads to inflammatory reactions , organ damage , and ultimately shock in the host 12 . rolipram is a typical phosphodiesterase-4 ( pde-4 ) inhibitor , which can inhibit tnf production in activated mouse macrophages . furthermore , studies have shown that rolipram markedly restrains carrageenan - induced acute inflammatory responses in mice 13 . both human and animal experiments have shown that rolipram is also an effective antidepressant , indicating significant bioavailability and effectiveness in the blood 14,15 . however , rolipram has never been studied as a sepsis treatment . we therefore hypothesized , based on preliminary results , that rolipram may protect mice from e. coli induced septic shock and e. coli derived lps resultant massive inflammatory response . our findings indicate that rolipram may protect mice from sepsis and septic shock - like symptoms induced by e. coli , clp , or e. coli derived lps , through inhibition of the nf - κb and map kinase signaling pathways . rolipram is already approved and in use for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder in the united states . as a result , if rolipram is shown to be a viable sepsis treatment in future experiments , significant time and money that would otherwise be spent on the drug - discovery process may be avoided altogether .

34e4b49c46c5462089f516983eeb19a6aff69d01	monocytes are a heterogeneous population of bone marrow - derived cells that are recruited to sites of infection and inflammation in many models of human diseases , including those of the central nervous system ( cns ) . ly6c hi / ccr2 hi inflammatory monocytes have been identified as the circulating precursors of brain macrophages , dendritic cells and arguably microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ; alzheimer 's disease ; stroke ; and more recently in cns infection caused by herpes simplex virus , murine hepatitis virus , theiler 's murine encephalomyelitis virus , japanese encephalitis virus and west nile virus . the precise differentiation pathways and functions of inflammatory monocyte - derived populations in the inflamed cns remains a contentious issue , especially in regard to the existence of monocyte - derived microglia . furthermore , the contributions of monocyte - derived subsets to viral clearance and immunopathology are not well - defined . thus , understanding the pathways through which inflammatory monocytes migrate to the brain and their functional capacity within the cns is critical to inform future therapeutic strategies . this review discusses some of the key aspects of inflammatory monocyte trafficking to the brain and addresses the role of these cells in viral encephalitis . 
35216abe0a88edda40c6249dd732c68d60dc9e8c	the potential for environmental and occupational exposures of populations to nanomaterials ( nms ) has fostered concerns of associated adverse health effects , with a particular emphasis on pulmonary injury and disease . many studies have revealed that several types of nms can evoke a variety of biological responses , such as pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress , which contribute to allergy , fibrosis , and granuloma formation . less attention has been paid to health effects that may result from exposure to nms and additional stressors such as pathogens , with a particular focus on susceptibility to viral infection . this chapter will summarize the current body of literature related to nms and viral exposures with a primary focus on immune modulation . a summary of the studies performed and major findings to date will be discussed , highlighting proposed molecular mechanisms behind nm - driven host susceptibility , challenges , limitations , and future research needs . specific mechanisms discussed include direct interaction between nms and biological molecules , activation of pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) and related signaling pathways , production of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction , inflammasome activation , and modulation of lipid signaling networks . 
3576b9e0d1895a2d2cb0231304425e1633e86e82	reverse transcriptase ( rt ) of human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv)-1 plays a key role in initiating viral replication and is an important target for developing anti - hiv drugs . our previous study showed that two mutations ( y271a and i274a ) in the turn rt ( gln 269 -arg 277 ) abrogated viral replication , but the replication capacity and rt activity was discordant . in this study , we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication . we found that both rt activity and rt protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants , although the pr160 gag - pol mutants were properly expressed , transported and incorporated . using protease inhibition assay , we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the rt mutants and the activity of viral protease . our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes , leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers , resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease . thus , residues 271 and 274 are critical to rt stability and resistance to viral protease . the conservation of the two amino acid residues among different strains of hiv-1 lent further support to this conclusion . the knowledge gained here may prove useful in drug design . 
357a008270023e621d758ada372b14e676edb782	the 2009 pandemic of h1n1 influenza , compounded with seasonal influenza , posed a global challenge . despite the announcement of post - pandemic period on 10 august 2010 by thewho , h1n1 ( 2009 ) virus would continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years and national health authorities should remain vigilant due to unpredictable behaviour of the virus . majority of the world population is living in countries with inadequate resources to purchase vaccines and stockpile antiviral drugs . basic hygienic measures such as wearing face masks and the hygienic practice of hand washing could reduce the spread of the respiratory viruses . however , the imminent issue is translating these measures into day - to - day practice . the experience from severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in hong kong has shown that general practitioners ( gps ) were willing to discharge their duties despite risks of getting infected themselves . sars event has highlighted the inadequate interface between primary and secondary care and valuable health care resources were thus inappropriately matched to community needs . there are various ways for gps to contribute in combating the influenza pandemic . they are prompt in detecting and monitoring epidemics and mini - epidemics of viral illnesses in the community . they can empower and raise the health literacy of the community such as advocating personal hygiene and other precautious measures . gps could also assist in the development of protocols for primary care management of patients with flu - like illnesses and conduct clinical audits on the standards of preventive and treatment measures . gps with adequate liaison with public health agencies would facilitate early diagnosis of patients with influenza . in this article , we summarise the primary care actions for phases 4 - 6 of the pandemic . we shall discuss the novel roles of gps as alternative source of health care for patients who would otherwise be cared for in the secondary care level . the health care system would thus remain sustainable during the public health crisis . 
357ecba25af78078e54800e90def3223f93d162b	an important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading . several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses , subunit vaccines , virus - like particles ( vlps ) , dna vaccines , heterologous expression systems , and vaccines derived from sars - cov genome by reverse genetics . this review describes several aspects essential to develop sars - cov vaccines , such as the correlates of protection , virus serotypes , vaccination side effects , and bio - safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the sars - cov genome . the production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent sars has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates , in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses , that in general has been less successful . after preclinical trials in animal models , efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humans .

360991ff283a6ec08b264813dba65427cecfa615	dromedary camels ( camelus dromedarius ) are now known to be the vertebrate animal reservoir that intermittently transmits the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) to humans . yet , details as to the specific mechanism(s ) of zoonotic transmission from dromedaries to humans remain unclear . the aim of this study was to describe direct and indirect contact with dromedaries among all cases , and then separately for primary , non - primary , and unclassified cases of laboratory - confirmed mers - cov reported to the world health organization ( who ) between 1 january 2015 and 13 april 2018 . we present any reported dromedary contact : direct , indirect , and type of indirect contact . of all 1125 laboratory - confirmed mers - cov cases reported to who during the time period , there were 348 ( 30.9 % ) primary cases , 455 ( 40.4 % ) non - primary cases , and 322 ( 28.6 % ) unclassified cases . among primary cases , 191 ( 54.9 % ) reported contact with dromedaries : 164 ( 47.1 % ) reported direct contact , 155 ( 44.5 % ) reported indirect contact . five ( 1.1 % ) non - primary cases also reported contact with dromedaries . overall , unpasteurized milk was the most frequent type of dromedary product consumed . among cases for whom exposure was systematically collected and reported to who , contact with dromedaries or dromedary products has played an important role in zoonotic transmission . viruses 2018 , 10 , 425 2 of 10 and associated clusters in other regions of the world . outbreaks of non - sustained , human - to - human transmission have primarily occurred in healthcare settings [ 2 ] . mers - cov appears to be transmitted inefficiently between humans through casual contact in the general community [ 3 ] . in contrast , limited human - to - human transmission has occurred in healthcare settings from unprotected contact with or inadequate infection prevention and control measures in the care of mers patients [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . health - care associated outbreaks have , on occasion , resulted in large outbreaks with significant public health and economic consequences , and health - care associated infections account for approximately half of the mers - cov infections reported to who to date . there have been significant improvements in implementation of adequate and specific infection prevention and control measures during healthcare outbreaks and these efforts have been shown to reduce human - to - human transmission in healthcare settings [ 11 ] . despite this , substantial work remains to understand and prevent mers - cov from entering the human population and thus reducing the potential for amplified transmission in healthcare settings . there is now strong consensus that dromedary camels ( camelus dromedarius ) are the main source of transmission of mers - cov to humans . despite mers - cov causing little to no disease in dromedaries , mers - cov can circulate within and between dromedary herds , and from dromedaries to humans [ 12 ] . mers - cov rna has been detected , and viable virus has been isolated from dromedaries , including partial mers - cov genome sequences [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . analysis of outbreaks associated with a barn in ksa [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] and in qatar [ 17 , 24 ] inferred animal - to - human transmission following parallel dromedary and human infections with nearly identical strains of mers - cov. field surveys have been conducted on several domestic and wildlife species , including dromedary and bactrian camels ( camelus bactrianus ) , 
3621c51926a3c013cc756f5f4b5b996db2b87883	this paper illustrates how chronic uncertainty caused by crisis events affects the availability of entrepreneurial sources of finance for start - ups and small and medium - sized enterprises ( smes ) . to explore this line of argument , this paper examines crunchbase real - time data examining entrepreneurial finance investments in china during unfolding covid-19 crisis . the paper shows that these equity investments slumped dramatically in the immediate aftermath of the covid-19 virus , resulting in a year on year decrease of 60 % in the total volume of investment raised between quarter 1 in 2019 and quarter 1 in 2020 . importantly , the paper found early - stage seed investments falling the steepest , suggesting nascent start - ups are those most heavily affected by the crisis . while the global financial crisis heavily hit debt markets , the relational nature of equity investments may mean entrepreneurial finance is even more susceptible to major upheaval caused by the covid-19 crisis . overall , enterprise policy makers need to become better attuned at monitoring real - time data sources to mitigate chronic entrepreneurial uncertainty via strategic policy responses . 
366b6d0b2e9e495191749ab57814cebd64993105	acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child morbidity , especially in developing countries . viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections . in senegal , few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available , and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections . clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old . a standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient . these samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex rt - pcr or by viral culture . a total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included , and 48 ( 58.5 % ) were found to be positive , with a total of 55 viral detections ; several samples were positive for two ( n ¼ 5 ) or 3 ( n ¼ 1 ) viruses . ten different viruses were identified : influenza viruses a , b , and c ( n ¼ 25 ) , human respiratory syncytial virus type a ( n ¼ 13 ) , rhinoviruses ( n ¼ 8) , human coronaviruses type 229e and nl63 ( n ¼ 6 ) , parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 ( n ¼ 2 ) , and bocavirus ( n ¼ 1 ) . these results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in senegal . the establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies . 
3686cc6679e6b69e0ff3187aeb37ab90478236f5	to celebrate the 60th anniversary of science china , the second issue of science china life sciences ( 2010 ) focuses on immunology , with six articles contributed by immunologists working both in and outside china . the articles review the current position and recent developments in the field of immunology , including tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) receptor - associated factor ( traf ) family molecules , innate recognition , plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pdcs ) , costimulatory molecules , t cells , and humanized mouse models . as early as 1798 , the word " vaccination " was coined specifically to describe the injection of smallpox vaccine . in 1880 , louis pasteur published a paper on pasteurella septica cholera , heralding the beginning of a new scientific field : immunology . from then on , pasteur 's germ theory of human infectious disease facilitated the development of various vaccines , leading to a greater understanding of the immune system which , in turn , resulted in the expansion of the field of immunology . for a century , immunologists around the world have enhanced our understanding of the immune system ; from humoral and cellular adaptive immunity to the pattern recognition involved in innate immunity . alongside great advances due to the expansion of molecular biology over the past decade , immunology has become a central pillar of the life sciences , developing many branches such as medical immunology , tumor immunology , clinical immunology and transplantation immunology . as an integral component of medical science , immunology plays an important role in deepening the understanding of the pathophysiology of human disease , and also contributes to the development of modern therapeutics to treat infection , autoimmune diseases , allergies and cancer . in recent years , chinese immunologists have produced many important studies in immunology . the following reviews provide a brief overview of recent advances in immunology , highlighting the contributions of leading chinese immunologists . the first review " traf - mediated regulation of immune and inflammatory responses " by wang et al . [ 1 ] focuses on the traf family , beginning with a comprehensive introduction to structure and function . over the past few years , research studies have established a central role of traf proteins in inflammation and immunity . the traf family plays divergent and non - redundant roles in regulating the many signal transduction pathways involved in innate and adaptive immune responses . these molecules participate in signal transduction by a large number of receptor families , including the tnf receptor family and the toll - like receptor - interleukin-1 receptor family . the review summarizes the divergent roles played by traf proteins in positive and negative regulation of the canonical and non - canonical nf - κb pathways and type i interferon pathways , and also points out many aspects of traf biology that , although not clear , may still be of great significance to related research . the second review is entitled " on self - non - self discrimination in pattern recognition " by liu et al . [ 2 ] . the first section of this article discusses the development of immunity from a historical perspective . the second part deals with two different patterns of innate immune recognition . the third part then goes on to summarize the latest advances in the authors ' own research into the cd24-siglecg/10 pathway . according to their studies , the cd24 / siglec 10 pathway discriminates pathogen - associated molecular patterns

37f71b88b0091fb0d6232dd9e8ee4cfd7c3b6f64	background : respiratory infections are common reasons for hospital admission , and are associated with enormous economic burden due to significant morbidity and mortality . the wide spectrum of microbial agents underlying the pathology renders the diagnosis of respiratory infections challenging . molecular diagnostics offer an advantage to the current serological and culture - based methods in terms of sensitivity , coverage , hands - on time , and time to results . objectives : this study aimed to compare the clinical performance of three commercial kits for respiratory viral detection . study design : the performance of filmarray respiratory panel , anyplexii rv16 , and argene was compared using clinical respiratory samples ( n = 224 , comprising 189 nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium ( utm ) and 35 endotracheal aspirates ) , based on common overlapping targets across the platforms . influenza a " equivocal " and " no - subtype " samples by filmarray were further compared to a laboratory - developed influenza a / b test . the overall performance of all three platforms appeared to be comparable with regards to sensitivities ( 95.8 - 97.9 % ) and specificities ( 96.1 - 98.0 % ) , detection of coinfections , and distinguishment of influenza from non - influenza cases . " equivocal " and " no - subtype " samples by filmarray mostly represented weak influenza a by laboratory - developed test . lower respiratory tract samples had comparable final - run success - rates and discordant - rates as compared to utm . coronavirus hku1 , which was not targeted by anyplexii rv16 , were detected as oc43 . the expected test volume would be the main determinant for the selection of platform . among the platforms , the filmarray is the most automated but is of the lowest - throughput and has the highest reagent cost . 
384aeafc2fba9e88eb8be90a973006e97d5b74a4	viral infections are important causes of disease of the respiratory tract . respiratory viral infections frequently complicate the course of patients with copd and asthma . infl uenza continues to be a major cause of mortality and serious morbidity , not only in the tropics but on a worldwide basis . another viral pathogen that causes serious pneumonia in adults is the varicella - zoster virus . recent years have seen the emergence of new respiratory pathogens , such as the avian and porcine infl uenza a viruses , the sars coronaviruses , and the h1n1 virus . the need for advanced laboratory technology to investigate the etiology of viral infections is probably the main reason for the patchy data on viral pulmonary infection in the tropics . because viral infections may be complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonias , invasive procedures would be needed to accurately differentiate among pure viral pneumonias , secondary bacterial pneumonias , and mixed viral and bacterial infections . the recommended approach to these infections is mainly preventive which includes vaccination ( if available for the particular virus ) and early medical consultation . 
384f32cfc1c0011b6984771ca33a225e9ded6f48	background : viral upper respiratory tract infection ( vuri ) may or may not present with a cold / flu - like illness ( cfli ) . objectives : for common upper respiratory viruses that cause vuris , to determine the relative frequencies of virus detection by pcr in subjects with and without cflis . study design : prospective follow - up of 170 children aged 1 - 8.6 years through the cfli season by daily parental diary for cfli episodes and nasal secretion sampling using pcr assays for adenovirus , coronavirus ( types 229e and oc43 ) , influenza virus ( types a and b ) , parainfluenza ( types 1 - 3 ) virus , rhinovirus , and respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) . results : virus was detected in 415 of 956 independent assays : 425 cfli episodes and 531 non - cfli periods were sampled ; samples from 270 ( 64 % ) cfli episodes and 145 ( 27 % ) non - cfli periods contained virus detected by pcr . rhinovirus was most frequently detected at 64 % , followed by mixed viruses at 12 % , rsv at 7 % , and the other viruses at 3 - 5 % of all detections . about 85 % of rsv , influenza a and adenovirus detections were associated with a cfli , whereas less than 62 % of other virus detections were associated with cfli . conclusions : the frequency of pcr virus detection without cfli was different among viruses . this introduces virus - specific biases to estimating the frequencies of specific complications attributable to a vuri when ascertained by cfli identification .

390986fafd862ce729f6b70687723d8c002e58a8	background : drug safety assessments in clinical trials present unique analytical challenges . some of these include adjusting for individual follow - up time , repeated measurements of multiple outcomes and missing data among others . furthermore , pre - specifying appropriate analysis becomes difficult as some safety endpoints are unexpected . although existing guidelines such as consort encourage thorough reporting of adverse events ( aes ) in clinical trials , they provide limited details for safety data analysis . the limited guidelines may influence suboptimal analysis by failing to account for some analysis challenges above . a typical example where such challenges exist are trials of anti - malarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy . lack of proper standardized evaluation of the safety of antimalarial drugs has limited the ability to draw conclusions about safety . therefore , a systematic review was conducted to establish the current practice in statistical analysis for preventive antimalarial drug safety in pregnancy . eighteen trials were included in this review that collected multiple longitudinal safety outcomes including aes . statistical analysis and reporting of the safety outcomes in all the trials used descriptive statistics ; proportions/ counts ( n = 18 , 100 % ) and mean / median ( n = 2 , 11.1 % ) . results presentation included tabular ( n = 16 , 88.9 % ) and text description ( n = 2 , 11.1 % ) . univariate inferential methods were reported in most trials ( n = 16 , 88.9 % ) ; including chi square / fisher 's exact test ( n = 12 , 66.7 % ) , t test ( n = 2 , 11.1 % ) and mann - whitney / wilcoxon test ( n = 1 , 5.6 % ) . multivariable methods , including poisson and negative binomial were reported in few trials ( n = 3 , 16.7 % ) . assessment of a potential link between missing efficacy data and safety outcomes was not reported in any of the trials that reported efficacy missing data ( n = 7 , 38.9 % ) . the review demonstrated that statistical analysis of safety data in anti - malarial drugs for malarial chemoprevention in pregnancy rcts is inadequate . the analyses insufficiently account for multiple safety outcomes potential dependence , follow - up time and informative missing data which can compromise anti - malarial drug safety evidence development , based on the available data . 
3965a2d31b31a317f72d0f08695060dbd6952f82	the initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the covid-19 epidemic was identified in wuhan , china in december 2019 . while early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market , human - to - human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout china . the chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city - wide lockdowns , screening at airports and train stations , and isolation of suspected patients ; however , the cumulative case count keeps growing every day . the ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers , as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory , and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated . we use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short - term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in hubei province , the epicenter of the epidemic , and for the overall trajectory in china , excluding the province of hubei . we collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-ncov outbreak for each chinese province from the national health commission of china . here , we provide 5 , 10 , and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days , february 5th through february 9th , with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model , the richards growth model , and a sub - epidemic wave model . our most recent forecasts reported here , based on data up until february 9 , 2020 , largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409e7496 additional confirmed cases in hubei and 1128e1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days . models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in hubei and 11,588e13,499 in other provinces by february 24 , 2020 . mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates ( february 7th e 9th ) . we also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both hubei and other provinces . our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in china are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days . 
39d57801c57e1abf6a5f5e9e05f9834a1dd7ee90	the potential for infection by coronaviruses ( covs ) has become a serious concern with the recent emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in the human population . covs encode two large polyproteins , which are then processed into 15 - 16 nonstructural proteins ( nsps ) that make significant contributions to viral replication and transcription by assembling the rna replicase complex . among them , nsp9 plays an essential role in viral replication by forming a homodimer that binds single - stranded rna . thus , disrupting nsp9 dimerization is a potential anti - cov therapy . however , different nsp9 dimer forms have been reported for alpha - and beta - covs , and no structural information is available for gamma - covs . here we determined the crystal structure of nsp9 from the avian infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) , a representative gamma - cov that affects the economy of the poultry industry because it can infect domestic fowl . ibv nsp9 forms a homodimer via interactions across a hydrophobic interface , which consists of two parallel alpha helices near the carboxy terminus of the protein . the ibv nsp9 dimer resembles that of sars - cov nsp9 , indicating that this type of dimerization is conserved among all covs . this makes disruption of the dimeric interface an excellent strategy for developing anti - cov protein data bank accession codes : the atomic coordinate and structure factors of ibv nsp9 were submitted to rcsb protein data bank , with accession code 5c94 . therapies . to facilitate this effort , we characterized the roles of six conserved residues on this interface using site - directed mutagenesis and a multitude of biochemical and biophysical methods . we found that three residues are critical for nsp9 dimerization and its abitlity to bind rna . in this study , the dimeric nsp9 crystal structure of avian infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) was solved at 2.5 å resolution . a hydrophobic region and two parallel a - helices were found to be essential for nsp9 dimerization . the dimeric state was independently evaluated using multiple biochemical methods , including mutagenesis , circular dichroism , size exclusion chromatography with in - line multi - angle light scattering analysis ( sec - mals ) , electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( esi - ms ) , and analytical ultracentrifugation . this is the first time an nsp9 structure for a gamma - coronavirus has been determined . 
39fae6df128e98e970b22ea35cebdaaac78a647e	middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a contagious respiratory pathogen that is contracted via close contact with an infected subject . transmission of the pathogen has occurred through animal - to - human contact at first followed by human - to - human contact within families and health care facilities . this study is based on a retrospective analysis of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak in the kingdom of saudi arabia between june 2012 and july 2015 . a geoadditive variable model for binary outcomes was applied to account for both individual level risk factors as well spatial variation via a fully bayesian approach . out of 959 confirmed cases , 642 ( 67 % ) were males and 317 ( 33 % ) had died . three hundred and sixty four ( 38 % ) cases occurred in ar riyad province , while 325 ( 34 % ) cases occurred in makkah . individuals with some comorbidity had a significantly higher likelihood of dying from mers - cov compared with those who did not suffer comorbidity [ odds ratio ( or ) = 2.071 ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 1.307 , 3.263 ] . health - care workers were significantly less likely to die from the disease compared with non - health workers [ or = 0.372 , 95 % ci : 0.151 , 0.827 ] . patients who had fatal clinical experience and those with clinical and subclinical experiences were equally less likely to die from the disease compared with patients who did not have fatal clinical experience and those without clinical and subclinical experiences respectively . the odds of dying from the disease was found to increase as age increased beyond 25 years and was much higher for individuals with any underlying comorbidities . 
3acbd6e6bb0e683cf6818c1ac8e761d9ac9911d8	spinal cord injuries ( scis ) present distinct physiological and social considerations for the emergency physician . during the covid-19 pandemic , these considerations may generate unique challenges for emergency physicians managing patients with scis . physiological disruptions may alter the way sci patients present with covid-19 . the same disruptions can affect management of this vulnerable patient group , perhaps warranting early aggressive treatment . the medical picture will often be complicated by unique social characteristics . the reliance on caregivers for activities of daily living can , as an example , increase the human resource requirement of an ed . considering the vulnerabilities and complexities of patients with sci , the community should prioritise prevention of covid-19 infections in this group . in the event that they do present to an ed , planning for and understanding their complexities will facilitate optimal management . 
3af50b021800015594a4a895b7e0825eb1731ad2	fecal indicator bacteria , such as escherichia coli ( e.coli ) and enterococcus , have been widely used to indicate the presence of pathogens . however , the suitability of fecal indicator bacteria to represent health risks is still being challenged , particularly in tropical aquatic environments . the objective of this study is to understand the occurrence and prevalence of indicators and pathogens in areas with contrasting land use , as well as to identify the major correlations between indicators , pathogens and environmental parameters . the spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use , and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations . a total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries , and tested for fecal indicator bacteria , coliphages , human specific markers , pathogenic bacteria and viruses . the prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low , while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees . of the enteric viruses , norovirus gii was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration . although strong correlations were found between indicators , only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens . the results in this study showed that none of the bacteria / phage indicators were universal predictors for pathogens . inclusion of the alternative indicators , methanobrevibacter smithii , bacteroides and human polyomaviruses ( hpyvs ) to monitoring programs could help to determine whether the fecal source was human . the microbial distribution patterns allow the classification of sampling sites to different clusters and thus , help to identify sites which have poor water quality . this approach will be useful for water quality management to pinpoint factors that influence water quality and help to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality . 
3b0b0f730fbd22ac5857143b28950a28e7b458e1	bats are notorious reservoirs of several zoonotic diseases and may be uniquely tolerant of infection among mammals . broad sampling has revealed the importance of bats in the diversification and spread of viruses and eukaryotes to other animal hosts . vector - borne bacteria of the genus bartonella are prevalent and diverse in mammals globally and recent surveys have revealed numerous bartonella lineages in bats . we assembled a sequence database of bartonella strains , consisting of nine genetic loci from 209 previously characterized lineages and 121 new cultured strains from bats , and used these data to perform the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of bartonella to date . this analysis included estimation of divergence dates using a molecular clock and ancestral reconstruction of host associations and geography . we estimate that bartonella began infecting mammals 62 million years ago near the cretaceous - paleogene boundary . additionally , the radiation of particular bartonella clades correlate strongly to the timing of diversification and biogeography of mammalian hosts . bats were inferred to be the ancestral hosts of all mammal - associated bartonella and appear to be responsible for the early geographic expansion of the genus . we conclude that bats have had a deep influence on the evolutionary radiation of bartonella bacteria and their spread to other mammalian orders . these results support a ' bat seeding ' hypothesis that could explain similar evolutionary patterns in other mammalian parasite taxa . application of such phylogenetic tools as we have used to other taxa may reveal the general importance of bats in the ancient diversification of mammalian parasites . discovering the evolutionary history of infectious agents in animals is important for understanding the process of host adaptation and the origins of human diseases . to clarify the evolution of the bartonella genus , which contains important human pathogens , we performed phylogenetic analysis on a broad diversity of bartonella strains , including novel strains from bats . our results indicate that bartonella clades diversified along with their mammal hosts over millions of years . bats appear to be especially important in the early radiation and geographic dispersal of bartonella lineages . these patterns are consistent with research indicating a chiropteran origin of important human viruses and eukaryotic parasites , suggesting that bats may play a unique role as historical sources of infections to other hosts .

3e35ff32458a72969e8a16972a4d16bc9f89478d	covid-19 pandemy has ignited a broad scientific interest in coronavirus research . the identification of coronaviridae species in natural reservoirs often requires de novo assembly . however , existing transcriptome assemblers often are not able to assemble coronaviruses into a single contig . we developed coronaspades , a new module for spades assembler for coronavirus species recovery . coronaspades uses the knowledge about coronaviridae genome structure to improve assembly . we have shown that coronaspades outperforms existing spades modes and other popular short - read assemblers in the recovery of full - length coronavirus genomes . this should allow to better understand the coronaviridae spread and diversity . background covid-19 pandemy has increased a scientific interest in coronavirus research . the analysis of coronavirus dataset starts with obtaining full - length virus genome sequence that can be performed using read alignment[1,2 ] or de novo assembly [ 1,3 ] . the assembly pipeline based on read alignment is a tool of choice for the same strains of the close species , e.g. for sars - cov-2 snp profiling of confirmed covid-19 patients . de novo assembly is better suited for novel species recovery since read alignment for distant species is unreliable . recently , there were multiple studies that used megahit[4 ] assembler to recover full - length sequence of the sars - cov-2 genome . though previous studies show that different spades[5 ] modes also perform well in virus recovery [ 6 ] . nevertheless , none of these assemblers was initially designed for viral assemblies in general and for coronaviridae species recovery in particular . megahit and metaspades[7 ] are metagenomic assemblers , spades[8 ] is designed to assemble single - cell and isolate bacterial datasets . all these assemblers can produce fragmented assemblies due to sequencing artifacts , coverage variations , host contamination , multiple strains presence , and coronavirus splice events [ 9 ] . fast and correct characterization of virus datasets might be a key step in predicting and preventing the future outbreaks . coronaviruses have a conserved gene structure[10 ] that can help to better assemble full - length genomes . in this study , we present coronaspades -a new mode for spades assembler designed to assemble coronaviridae species .

3f551bf91d2b52cadac39dbd62e7ae0f51066446	the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) in 2012 has generated enormous interest in the biodiversity , genomics and cross - species transmission potential of coronaviruses , especially those from bats , the second most speciose order of mammals . herein , we identified a novel coronavirus , provisionally designated rousettus bat coronavirus gccdc1 ( ro - batcov gccdc1 ) , in the rectal swab samples of rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan - coronavirus rt - pcr and next - generation sequencing . although the virus is similar to rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 ( ro - batcov hku9 ) in genome characteristics , it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the international committee of taxonomy of viruses ( ictv ) . more striking was that ro - batcov gccdc1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3'-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus , but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus . subgenomic mrna and cellular - level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia . therefore , here we report a putative heterologous inter - family recombination event between a single - stranded , positive - sense plos pathogens |

4041dbdf50df73b5c4dd4f9d11f74c7335c33564	s epsis is a common clinical syndrome arising from a dysregulated host response to systemic infection leading to lifethreatening end - organ damage 1 . while the incidence of sepsis varies 2 , the substantial burden of critical illness reflects an aging and susceptible population with escalating comorbid conditions 3 , 4 . with the exception of early antibiotics and fluids 5 - 7 , targeted new therapies for sepsis have remained elusive 8 . however , through research , our understanding of sepsis has evolved from being seen solely as an exuberant host immune response 9 to the intersection of pro - and anti - inflammatory , endothelial , coagulation , metabolic , endocrine , and neural pathways 10,11 . the foundation of such research has been the use of small animals in studies to unravel mechanisms of sepsis pathophysiology and develop novel therapeutics 12,13 . this review briefly presents the common nonhuman primate ( nhp ) models of bacterial sepsis and summarizes the contributions to our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and drug discovery , and how they might impact on future targeted research . an ideal animal model of sepsis must balance biological feasibility and practical considerations . the animal species should recapitulate the same hemodynamic changes to infection seen in humans , such as hypotension , low systemic vascular resistance ( svr ) , and a compensatory increase in cardiac output ( co ) following fluid resuscitation [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] . animals should also demonstrate similar signs and symptoms of infection , such as decreased activity or oral intake , change in body temperature , and change in white blood cell count 12 . the model should include provision of antibiotics 17,18 , a standard of care treatment for patients 1 that may alter host cytokine responses 19 and significantly improves survival 20 . the species should also activate similar molecular pathways , such as cytokine release in response to circulating pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) 11 , and should lead to development of multiple organ dysfunction ( mod ) 21 , 22 . practically , the model must be economically reasonable , easy to support , and large enough for the collection of physiological data . the earliest and most widely used animal species for sepsis studies has been rats and mice . murines are attractive because they are inexpensive , easy to breed , versatile , and genetically modifiable 8,12,13 . the rat model of endotoxemic sepsis with fluid resuscitation relies on intravenous lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) to mimic the physiological responses of gram - negative sepsis in humans . unlike human sepsis , which is a protracted response to live pathogens , lps induces a rapid , transient inflammatory surge that causes mainly vascular injury 13 . the rat cecal - ligation and puncture ( clp ) technique was developed to mimic human abdominal sepsis from live polymicrobial bacteria 12,23,24 . though this model has been widely considered the gold standard for rodent studies , it is limited by variability in technique ( e.g. number of punctures , size of puncture ) 23 and pathogen ( e.g. polymicrobial ) 24 . as an alternative rat model , the monomicrobial staphylococcus aureus impregnated clot model of peritoneal sepsis was developed to simulate post - operative abdominal wound infections 25 . another model using intravenous injection of live bacteria simulates the bacteremia seen in up to 69 % of human septic shock 24 , but does so by artificially infusing a large inoculum of bacteria into the bloodstream rather than by slow release from an established nidus of infection 12 . rodent models suffer from important technical limitations . their small size makes invasive hemodynamic monitoring difficult , and their small total blood volume ( approximately 2 ml in mice and 20 ml in rats ) limits serial phlebotomy 23 . mice are also more resistant to lps and bacterial pathogens than are humans , requiring 10 4 -to 10 5 -fold higher doses to achieve shock 8,13,24 . once shock develops , the hemodynamic and cytokine profiles of small rodents differ greatly from those of humans 8,24 , though the inconsistent use of fluid resuscitation in these studies may have affected the results . the sizable technical and biological challenges ultimately led to the use of larger mammals such as rabbits , sheep , dogs , and pigs , whose sizes permitted invasive and serial procedures 12,23 . many large animals also exhibit sepsis physiology that is similar to humans . for instance , pigs are prone to sepsis - induced capillary leak and development of pulmonary edema , and sheep display similar hyperdynamic responses ( i.e. elevated heart rate , cardiac output , and oxygen delivery with depressed systemic vascular resistance ) to endotoxin sepsis involves a disordered host response to systemic infection leading to high morbidity and mortality . despite intense research , targeted sepsis therapies beyond antibiotics have remained elusive . the cornerstone of sepsis research is the development of animal models to mimic human bacterial infections and test novel pharmacologic targets . nonhuman primates ( nhps ) have served as an attractive , but expensive , animal to model human bacterial infections due to their nearly identical cardiopulmonary anatomy and physiology , as well as host response to infection . several nhp species have provided substantial insight into sepsis - mediated inflammation , endothelial dysfunction , acute lung injury , and multi - organ failure . the use of nhps has usually focused on translating therapies from early preclinical models to human clinical trials . however , despite successful sepsis interventions in nhp models , there are still no fda - approved sepsis therapies . this review highlights major nhp models of bacterial sepsis and their relevance to clinical medicine . lab animal | vol 48 | february 2019 | 57 - 65 | www.nature.com/laban 57 
40897ed0606a6a0e1eba23f7690270abdfc297ff	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) is the causative agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pandemic . understanding both the immunological processes providing specific immunity and potential immunopathology underlying the pathogenesis of this disease may provide valuable insights for potential therapeutic interventions . here , we quantified sars - cov-2 specific immune responses in patients with different clinical courses . compared to individuals with a mild clinical presentation , cd4 + t cell responses were qualitatively impaired in critically ill patients . strikingly , however , in these patients the specific igg antibody response was remarkably strong . the observed disparate t and b cell responses could be indicative of a deregulated immune response in critically ill covid-19 patients . 
40afe56736a9733a103c22570b574165d7d38edd	the type i interferon system plays a critical role in limiting the spread of viral infection . viruses induce the production of interferon ( ifn ) , which after binding to the ifn- receptor ( ifnar ) , and triggering of the jak / stat signaling cascade , results in the induction of interferon - stimulated genes ( isgs ) . these isgs function to inhibit viral replication and to regulate the host immune response . among these isgs , the ubiquitin - like molecule , isg15 , is one of the most strongly induced proteins . similar to ubiquitin , through an ifn induced conjugation cascade , isg15 is covalently linked to a variety of cellular proteins , suggesting regulation of different cellular processes . studies performed over the past several years have shown that isg15 plays a central role in the host 's antiviral response against many viruses . mice lacking isg15 display increased susceptibility to multiple viruses . furthermore , several viruses have developed immune evasion strategies that directly target the isg15 pathway . work is now underway to determine the mechanism by which isg15 functions as an antiviral molecule , such that therapies targeting this pathway can be developed in the future . keywords : isg15 ; interferon ; antiviral ; ubiquitin - like molecule 1 . introduction - the isg15 pathway isg15 was first noted in type i interferon(ifn ; ifn- , -β ) treated cell lysates in 1984 and was soon after identified as having sequence homology to ubiquitin ( reviewed in reference [ 1 ] ) [ 2,3 ] . the crystal structure of isg15 revealed that it is composed of two domains , each of which assumes a β - grasp fold open access viruses 2010 , 2 2155 similar to the ubiquitin structure [ 2 ] . isg15 is one of the most abundantly - induced transcripts upon type i ifn treatment , as well as following tlr ligation and viral infection [ 3 , 4 ] . it is synthesized as a 17 kda precursor protein that is proteolytically processed into its mature 15 kda form [ 3 ] . following stimulation with type i ifn , isg15 exists in three distinct states - free within the cell , released into the extracellular space , or conjugated to target proteins . early after its identification , isg15 was reported to be found in an extracellular form . stimulation of human monocytes with type i ifn resulted in as much as 50 % of the accumulated isg15 being released into the media [ 5 ] . furthermore , the repeated treatment of patients with interferon - β ser resulted in detectable levels of isg15 in their sera within 48 hours of treatment [ 5 ] . isg15 does n't contain a signal sequence ; therefore , the mechanism by which it is released remains unknown . several immunomodulatory activities have been attributed to recombinant or extracellular isg15 including its ability to induce nk cell proliferation , augment lymphokine - activated - killer ( lak ) activity , stimulate the production of ifn - γ , induce dc maturation , and to function as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] . to date no cell surface receptor has been identified that binds to isg15 ; therefore the role that its potential cytokine activity plays in vivo is yet to be ascertained . similar to ubiquitin , the mature form of isg15 contains a c - terminal lrlrgg motif that mediates its covalent conjugation to target proteins , termed isgylation [ 9,10 ] . within two hours after type i ifn treatment , free isg15 is detectable in cell lysates , followed by conjugate formation 12 - 16 hours later [ 9 ] . isgylation utilizes a mechanism similar to ubiquitin , requiring three enzymatic steps ( figure 1 ) . the activating e1 enzyme , ube1l , was initially identified by robert krug and colleagues and functions only in the isg15 pathway , forming an atp - dependent thioester bond with isg15 [ 11 ] . the recent generation of an ube1l knockout mouse has confirmed its role as the isg15 e1 . these mice express free isg15 , but do not form isg15 conjugates following lps stimulation or during viral infection [ 12 ] . following activation , isg15 is transferred to the active - site cysteine of the conjugating e2 enzyme ubcm8 / ubch8 [ 13 , 14 ] . this is followed by the transfer of isg15 to lysine residues on target proteins by the e3 ligases . to date , three e3 ligases have been shown to interact with the isg15 pathway and include human herc5 ( ceb1)/mouse herc6 , hhari , . isgylation is reversible due to specific removal of isg15 from conjugated proteins by the deconjugating enzyme ubp43 ( usp18 ) [ 21 , 22 ] . a screen for additional deubiquitinating enzymes that could target isg15 conjugates identified usp2 , usp5 , usp13 , and usp14 as potential candidates , whose significance remain to be determined in vivo [ 23 ] . while in many ways the isg15 pathway parallels the ubiquitin conjugation pathway , there are differences that exist . first , all members of the isg15 conjugation cascade are upregulated by type i ifns . second , unlike ubiquitin , in which hundreds of e3s are responsible for the individual substrate specificity , in the isg15 pathway , herc5 appears to be a dominant e3 ligase that coordinates the conjugation of the majority of substrates to isg15 . the inhibition of herc5 expression with sirna abrogated greater than 90 % of the isg15 conjugate formation that was induced [ 15 ] . a recent study by durfee and colleagues has shown the herc5 associates with polyribosomes and appears to target newly synthesized proteins , including viral proteins , for modification by isg15 , helping to explain the broad substrate specificity of herc5 [ 24 ] . 
40c0532640a8bb9d9a0aac07d017d5982af33fdb	feline coronavirus ( fcov ) is classified into two biotypes based on its pathogenicity in cats : a feline enteric coronavirus of low pathogenicity and a highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus . it has been suspected that fcov alters its biotype via mutations in the viral genome . the s and 3c genes of fcov have been considered the candidates for viral pathogenicity conversion . in the present study , fcovs were analyzed for the frequency and location of mutations in the s and 3c genes from faecal samples of cats in an animal shelter and the faeces , effusions , and tissues of cats that were referred to veterinary hospitals . our results indicated that approximately 95 % fcovs in faeces did not carry mutations in the two genes . however , 80 % fcovs in effusion samples exhibited mutations in the s and 3c genes with remainder displaying a mutation in the s or 3c gene . it was also suggested that mutational analysis of the 3c gene could be useful for studying the horizontal transmission of fcovs in multi - cat environments . the genome of feline coronavirus ( fcov ) , a member of the alphacoronavirus 1 species of the genus alphacoronavirus , comprises single - stranded positive - sense rna [ 9 ] . fcov infection is prevalent in cats worldwide and is divided into two biotypes : feline enteric coronavirus ( fecv ) and feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) . the former has low pathogenicity , causing mild enteritis or unapparent infection , and the latter is highly virulent and lethal . fip is characterised by the accumulation of body cavity effusions ( effusive or wet form ) and the formation of granulomatous lesions affecting multiple organs ( non - effusive or dry form ) [ 10 ] . fipvs are considered mutants of fecvs [ 11 , 12 , 14 ] . although the viral genes responsible for biotype conversion have not been completely elucidated , the candidate genes have been identified . the s gene encodes spike protein on the viral membrane . it was reported that 95.8 % of 118 serotype i fipvs displayed missense mutations in codon 1,058 or 1,060 of the s gene , whereas none of the sample of 183 fecvs exhibited these mutations [ 6 ] . the non - synonymous mutations in codons 1,058 and 1,060 substituted methionine to leucine ( m1,058l ) and serine to alanine ( s1,060a ) , respectively . the 3c gene encoding an accessory viral protein was also reported to be mutated in 60 - 100 % of fipvs , resulting in the loss or truncation of the 3c protein , whereas most fecvs carried an intact 3c gene [ 3 - 5 , 8 , 11 , 13 , 14 ] . accordingly , it was considered that mutation of the s gene , 3c gene or both was involved in the acquisition or augmentation of lethal pathogenicity in the majorityof fipv field strains . in the present study , we analyzed the s and 3c genes of fcovs detected in faecal materials , effusion samples , and tissues that were obtained from cats in japan to determine the frequency and location of the mutations . an analysis of the 3c gene suggested the horizontal infection of fcovs , which were detected in effusions and tissues , among several housemate cats in a multi - cat environment . materials and methods clinical specimens were obtained from 93 cats referred to private veterinary hospitals in japan for suspected fip based on clinical symptoms , including pyrexia , vomiting , diarrhoea , jaundice , emaciation , anaemia , ascites , pleural effusion , ophthalmologic abnormalities , neurological signs , and death . some animals displayed an enlargement of abdominal organs that was noticed on palpation , radiography , or ultrasound . the samples of abdominal and pleural effusions , whole blood , serum , rectal swabs , faeces and tissues were sent to our laboratory under refrigeration . tissues were obtained via autopsy of four cats that had been kept by the 
410e6ed33957e3d51b0f0066ff86a44284bfd501	together with influenza , the non - influenza rna respiratory viruses ( nirvs ) , which include respiratory syncytial virus , parainfluenza viruses , coronavirus , rhinovirus , and human metapneumovirus , represent a considerable global health burden , as recognised by who 's battle against respiratory viruses initiative . by contrast with influenza viruses , little is known about the contemporaneous global diversity of these viruses , and the relevance of such for development of pharmaceutical interventions . although far less advanced than for influenza , antiviral drugs and vaccines are in different stages of development for several of these viruses , but no interventions have been licensed . this scarcity of global genetic data represents a substantial knowledge gap and impediment to the eventual licensing of new antiviral drugs and vaccines for nirvs . enhanced genetic surveillance will assist and boost research and development into new antiviral drugs and vaccines for these viruses . additionally , understanding the global diversity of respiratory viruses is also part of emerging disease preparedness , because non - human coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses have been listed as priority concerns in a recent who research and development blueprint initiative for emerging infectious diseases . in this personal view , we explain further the rationale for expanding the genetic database of nirvs and emphasise the need for greater investment in this area of research .

4375209ab5826b2fab6be0f440c4b401e396e0f9	the exponential increase in covid-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare systems across the world . with limited testing kits , it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques ( rt - pcr ) . the tests also have long turn - around time , and limited sensitivity . detecting possible covid-19 infections on chest x - ray may help quarantine high risk patients while test results are awaited . x - ray machines are already available in most healthcare systems , and with most modern x - ray systems already digitized , there is no transportation time involved for the samples either . in this work we propose the use of chest x - ray to prioritize the selection of patients for further rt - pcr testing . this may be useful in an inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in covid-19 areas . it would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood of covid with a false negative rt - pcr who would need repeat testing . further , we propose the use of modern ai techniques to detect the covid-19 patients using x - ray images in an automated manner , particularly in settings where radiologists are not available , and help make the proposed testing technology scalable . we present covidaid : covid-19 ai detector , a novel deep neural network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing . on the publicly available covid - chestxray - dataset [ 2 ] dataset , our model gives 90.5 % accuracy with 100 % sensitivity ( recall ) for the covid-19 infection . we significantly improve upon the results of covid - net [ 10 ] on the same dataset . 
441421494c2a4ed45a8d6b711842ed8ee43ec038	fever screening based on infrared ( ir ) thermographs ( irts ) is an approach that has been implemented during infectious disease pandemics , such as ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome . a recently published international standard indicates that regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi provide accurate estimates of core body temperature and are preferred sites for fever screening . therefore , rapid , automated identification of the canthi regions within facial ir images may greatly facilitate rapid fever screening of asymptomatic travelers . however , it is more difficult to accurately identify the canthi regions from ir images than from visible images that are rich with exploitable features . in this study , we developed and evaluated techniques for multi - modality image registration ( mmir ) of simultaneously captured visible and ir facial images for fever screening . we used free form deformation ( ffd ) models based on edge maps to improve registration accuracy after an affine transformation . two widely used ffd models in medical image registration based on the demons and cubic b - spline algorithms were qualitatively compared . the results showed that the demons algorithm outperformed the cubic b - spline algorithm , likely due to overfitting of outliers by the latter method . the quantitative measure of registration accuracy , obtained through selected control point correspondence , was within 2.8 ± 1.2 mm , which enables accurate and automatic localization of canthi regions in the ir images for temperature measurement . 
44346ee6a8dc71d2d78915a44b407ef7cee177a9	the recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) in different countries around the world . because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols , facemasks and n95 respirators that require complex certification , are urgently needed . given the situation , the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) recommends that " in settings where facemasks are not available , healthcare personnel might use homemade masks ( e.g. , bandana , scarf ) for the care of patients with covid-19 as a last resort . " although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms , their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail . moreover , there are a series of non - medical materials available on the market , such as household air filters , coffee filters , and different types of fabrics , which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available . in this study , we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size - dependent filtration performances of non - medical materials . the experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size - dependent filtration performances . the flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials . the results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the n95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance . considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes , it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators .

471dbde40b162d112bacc68148816f63e83ecd12	the rise of machine learning in image processing has created a gap between trainable data - driven and classical modeldriven approaches : while learning - based models often show superior performance , classical ones are often more transparent . to reduce this gap , we introduce a generic wavelet shrinkage function for denoising which is adaptive to both the wavelet scales as well as the noise standard deviation . it is inferred from trained results of a tightly parametrised function which is inherited from nonlinear diffusion . our proposed shrinkage function is smooth and compact while only using two parameters . in contrast to many existing shrinkage functions , it is able to enhance image structures by amplifying wavelet coefficients . experiments show that it outperforms classical shrinkage functions by a significant margin .

47a9f294822514b5a4ebfea8f18cdfcd326f2f48	because outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) might reemerge , identifying antiviral compounds is of key importance . previously , we showed that the cellular factor tnf- ␣ converting enzyme ( tace ) , activated by the spike protein of sars - cov ( sars - s protein ) , was positively involved in viral entry , implying that tace is a possible target for developing antiviral compounds . to demonstrate this possibility , we here tested the effects of tace inhibitors on viral entry . in vitro and in vivo data revealed that the tace inhibitor tapi-2 attenuated entry of both pseudotyped virus expressing the sars - s protein in a lentiviral vector backbone and infectious sars - cov. tapi-2 blocked both the sars - s protein - induced shedding of angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , a receptor of sars - cov , and tnf- ␣ production in lung tissues . since the downregulation of ace2 by sars - s protein was proposed as an etiological event in the severe clinical manifestations , our data suggest that tace antagonists block sars - cov infection and also attenuate its severe clinical outcome .

4a5bedf760df7254411080fa445a34f5d964f054	there is a growing interest in one health , reflected by the rising number of publications relating to one health literature , but also through zoonotic disease outbreaks becoming more frequent , such as ebola , zika virus and covid-19 . this paper uses bibliometric analysis to explore the state of one health in academic literature , to visualise the characteristics and trends within the field through a network analysis of citation patterns and bibliographic links . the analysis focuses on publication trends , co - citation network of scientific journals , cocitation network of authors , and co - occurrence of keywords . the bibliometric analysis showed an increasing interest for one health in academic research . however , it revealed some thematic and disciplinary shortcomings , in particular with respect to the inclusion of environmental themes and social science insights pertaining to the implementation of one health policies . the analysis indicated that there is a need for more applicable approaches to strengthen intersectoral collaboration and knowledge sharing . silos between the disciplines of human medicine , veterinary medicine and environment still persist . engaging researchers with different expertise and disciplinary backgrounds will facilitate a more comprehensive perspective where the human - animal - environment interface is not researched as separate entities but as a coherent whole . further , journals dedicated to one health or interdisciplinary research provide scholars the possibility to publish multifaceted research . these journals are uniquely positioned to bridge between fields , strengthen interdisciplinary research and create room for social science approaches alongside of medical and natural sciences . j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre - proof the characteristics and trends within the field through a network analysis of citation patterns and bibliographic links . a bibliometric analysis is a quantitative method to capture , in this case , the networks of journals , authors and occurrences of keywords . by investigating these citation indices , it is possible to get an overview of the academic features and dynamics , the strengths and the shortcomings , that characterise a particular scientific field ( 3 ) . previous bibliometric studies have investigated the use of one health documents , examining journals over time , tracking the increase of public health research involving animals , or investigating the issue of citation indices in relation to veterinary medicine and one health publications ( 4 - 6 ) . this paper is the first to use bibliometric analysis to explore one health contributions across disciplines and sectors . the study documents an increased academic attention for the one health concept across multiple disciplines and sectors . however , the bibliometric analysis revealed some thematic and disciplinary shortcomings , in particular with respect to the incl usion of environmental themes and social science insights pertaining to the implementation and management of one health policies . rigid silos j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre - proof sample . second , the abstract of the remaining contributions ( 1.417 ) were manually screened to determine whether one health was included as a concept or was just a generic syntax . this screening exercise led to 937 contributions being discarded . the final sample consisted of 1.067 contributions pertaining to the concept of one health . j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre - proof fao , oie , and the world bank . generally , the network shows that the field is dominated by the who and zinsstag ( red and purple cluster ) , these clusters are also the most central to the flow of information in the network . scholars within the biodiversity and ecohealth cluster are less connected with the other clusters but especially scholars in the green cluster are more isolated from the other clusters . more specific , the network shows that , degeling and steve hinchliffe are often cited together with zinsstag by other authors , j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre - proof indicating similar characteristics in their research . the network also shows that zinsstag is often cited with the schelling and roth , which again signifies that the authors share similar properties . the organisations in the network are also co - cited by each other . especially the who was co - cited heavily within the network . notably , the european centre for disease prevention and control ( ecdc ) is not cited together with the american counterpart , the cdc . further , the european food safety authority ( efsa ) , an eu funded agency that provides independent scientific advice on food security , animal and plant health shows no direct connection to the ecdc or any other organisations . it indicates that the two european institutions are not commonly cited together despite covering similar one health topics . within the bibliometric analysis , the co - occurrence of keywords plus in the reviewed articles is analysed to reveal topics and concepts that are the most mentioned and interconnected . the clustering algorithm produces five distinct thematic clusters within the network ( red : microbiology ; blue : medical science ; green : veterinary science ; orange : public health management ; purple : anthropology ) . figure 5 illustrates that the blue ' medical science'-cluster is very central , connecting to all other disciplines and showing strong relations within and outside the cluster . most central keywords are prevalence , epidemiology , infection , risk factors and disease . the green cluster of veterinarian science is also central in the network with many and strong links to the other clusters . the microbiology cluster is also a prominent cluster in the network , although it is primarily a self - referential cluster with limited keyword links to other thematic clusters . the public health management and anthropology clusters are the least prominent clusters . in the anthropology cluster , there are only seven nodes , which are sparsely distributed with distant connections and no central nodes . the orange cluster is more central but key concepts such as strategies , knowledge , management and attitudes play a peripheral role . j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre - proof there has been a steady increase of one health articles , in particular in the wake of the fao / oie / who collaboration in 2010 . external pressures primarily in the form of disease outbreaks such as ebola and zika virus also appear to have facilitated further research into one health . in short , more and more scholars appear to display an interest in the holistic approach of one health . while this is indeed a welcome development , the bibliometric analysis reveals certain shortcomings in the academic field of one health that can be structured around three important dimensions : 1 ) diversity of sectors and disciplines ; 2 ) themes and interfaces addressed ; 3 ) scholars and institutions involved . the citation network of journals showed that one health is heavily researched in the sciences , particularly in the fields of microbiology , parasitology , infectious diseases and general sciences . the mostly cited journals for one health themes are the epidemiological journal emerging infectious diseases and the medical journal plos one . this is certainly merited , as many one health issues directly concern humans and animals , such as infectious diseases , foodborne illnesses and antimicrobial resistance . comprehensive research in these areas is crucial to combat health challenges within a one health approach . however , one health is also a tool to inform policy - makers , to manage infectious disease outbreaks , to implement strategies and to enhance institutionalisation ( 1 ) . the current coivid-19 pandemic has made it painstakingly clear that attention to these broader sets of socio - economic issues are essential in public health responses . scholars have long expressed concern of silo research in one health , advocating for more interdisciplinary research to include diverse perspectives ( e.g. social , political , anthropological ) ( 14,21 - 24 ) . the network analysis indicates that there is a general lack of journals for the type of interdisciplinary research that is promoted by the one health approach . the network analysis does identify some interdisciplinary journals well - positioned to capture broader socio - economic and management perspectives such as social science & medicine and ecohealth . interestingly , the bibliometric analysis did not reveal one j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre - proof health research in monodisciplinary social science outlets such as political science , global governance or public administration . neither did it reveal dedicated one health outlets . there are a few established one health journals such as one health outlook published by biomed central and the present one health outlet published by elsevier for the international federation for tropical medicine . however , these journals are recently established and have not yet made it into the wos. stronger cross - sectoral and interdisciplinary one health research can be promoted by either expanding the thematic areas in existing journals or by increasing the engagement of other types of journals such as those dedicated to one health or interdisciplinary journals . one health journals can provide a platform that encourages holistic research from multiple angles , combining quantitative and qualitative research that investigates one health issues not only as medical and biological themes , but as political as well as socio - cultural themes . social and political contributions can foster one health institutionalisation and facilitate policy dialogue . however , the journal network reveals few journals that bridge not just disciplines but whole research traditions , most notably between the medical and social sciences . hence , interdisciplinary work should be encouraged , as it can promote collaboration , communication as well as knowledge sharing across scientific traditions , disciplines and sectors . one health and broader public health outlets can facilitate the understanding of complex problems and promote the development of innovations also in the fields of implementation , management , strategy or institutionalisation . one of the defining features of a one health approach is the attention paid to the nexus between human , animal and environment . however , the field of environment is often disregarded in much one health research . the colour coding of the co - citation networks of journals and authors reveal that environmental perspectives are dwarfed in comparison to epidemiological , microbiological and public health perspectives . additionally , the co - occurrence of keywords shows that keywords relating to environment , ecology and biodiversity are scarce . these finding are in line with khan et al . and lebov et al . who both found that j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre - proof strategy to inform policy - making ( 16 ) . lebov et al . have also devised concrete planning guidelines for one health researchers on how to construct an interdisciplinary and holistic study design that covers all three health domains ( 24 ) . further , guidance documents such as the 2019 published tripartite guide should be considered when implementing one health activities ( 2 ) . 3 ) scholars and institutions j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f the study reveals a high degree of author proximity within and across departments and universities . the physical and academic closeness of the most active scholars might indicate the presence of homophily . homophily is the tendency of individuals to associate and interact with other individuals similar to them ( 28 ) . the proximity might increase effectiveness and create synergies , but risks resulting in a lack of diversity in approaches and themes ( 29 ) . some of these themes might be the environmental issues or social science perspectives . the citation network also illustrates the centrality of organisations such as the who , fao , cdc , oie and the world bank . these organisations appear to have a key role in scientific communication . the organisations have been working together , sharing information , which pushed forward the one health approach and contributed to the recognition of the approach . this is illustrated by the increase in publications of one health articles after their engagement in 2010 . especially the who is co - cited heavily by various authors and institutes , which is reflective of the institute 's engagement with research and guidance on one health related topics . however , these international organisations appear to completely dominate the policycluster at the expense of academic scholars . thus , there is clearly an opportunity for academic scholars to engage more with the policy field of management , implementation , strategies and policy collaboration in the context of one health . furthermore , to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and to strengthen the engagement of the environment field into one health , the fao / oie / who collaboration could involve the environmental sector . for example , the united nations environment programme could be engaged to push forward and connect human and animal health to the environment . maybe the tripartite could evolve to a quadripartite agreement ? the co - citation network for the ecdc , efsa and cdc indicates that although they all contribute to similar research areas , only limited connections between them could be traced in their research . the lack of co - citations indicates a potential barrier for cooperation beyond the limits of the own organisation . the organisations share core principles of the one health approach but appear to work in epistemological and/or institutional silos , as evidenced by limited cross - citations between organisations . to facilitate cross - institutional collaboration on one health research , more focus could be on activities that j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre - proof not only promote interdisciplinarity but cross - institutional engagements such as hosting one health workshops with broad participation , establishing cross - organisational research groups and encouraging coauthored research projects . it is essential to take advantage of the current momentum to advance the one health approach . the momentum is not only reflected by the rising number of publications relating to one health literature , but also through zoonotic disease outbreaks becoming more frequent , such as ebola , zika virus and the current case of covid-19 . the bibliometric analysis showed the potential and increasing interest for one health . however , it also revealed little engagement with the environmental sector . it indicated that there is a need for more applicable approaches to strengthen intersectoral collaboration and knowledge sharing . engaging researchers with different expertise and disciplinary backgrounds will facilitate a more comprehensive perspective where one health is researched in an interdisciplinary way that conceives of the humananimal - environment interface not as separate entities but as a coherent whole . existing frameworks and guidelines should be used to promote one health activities . further , journals dedicated to one health or interdisciplinary research provide scholars the possibility to publish multifaceted research . journals , such as this one , are uniquely positioned to bridge between fields and strengthen interdisciplinary research . with case studies of one health implementation and themes of governance as well as interdisciplinary collaboration , the journals can also create room for social science approaches alongside of medical and natural sciences . despite the success of one health , there is a need to pay attention to the persistent challenges of integrating social science disciplines , the environmental sector and researchers from diverse disciplines . nevertheless , the one health approach has the potential to be established as a comprehensive research field , engaging multifaceted expertise across disciplines . j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre -

4a7f4fc5641ee4b954a8c823c7c23858d0f9bd9b	in the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 transmission in the united states , there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases . hospital beds , intensive care units ( icus ) , and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness . to project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of icu beds required at peak , we simulated a covid-19 outbreak parameterized with the us population demographics . in scenario analyses , we varied the delay from symptom onset to self - isolation , the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self - isolation , and the basic reproduction number r 0 . without self - isolation , when r 0 = 2.5 , treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more icu beds than exist in the united states . self - isolation by 20 % of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory , reducing the number of icu beds needed at the peak by 48.4 % ( interquartile range 46.4 - 50.3 % ) , although still exceeding existing capacity . when r 0 = 2 , twice as many icu beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of selfisolation . in this scenario , the proportional impact of self - isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of icu beds is substantially higher at 73.5 % ( interquartile range 71.4 - 75.3 % ) . our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak . policies that encourage self - isolation , such as paid sick leave , may delay the epidemic peak , giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity . sars - cov-2 | hospitalization | self - isolation | critical care need 
4ae013938dce3aa0f6b63b49e37489f06a5d9a57	we thank cohen et al for their letter on our recent report on the association of inpatient use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors ( aceis ) and angiotensin ii receptor blockers ( arbs ) with mortality among the hospitalized coronavirus 2019 ( covid-19 ) patients with hypertension from hubei , china . 1 as cohen et al pointed out , and clearly discussed in our original report , the inherent limitations of such retrospective study must be carefully considered in interpreting the results . indeed , we had a great deal of concerns about potential bias and implemented 3 different models to cross - validate the key conclusions . first , a mixedeffect cox model was used by adjusting for confounding variables . second , we applied a stricter propensity scorematched analysis , followed by adjusting imbalanced variables . finally , to further minimize the potential bias resulting from patients who did not receive antihypertensive drugs , we conducted a subgroup propensity score - matched analysis by including only the patients who received antihypertensive medication during hospitalization . we did not find an association for harm with those on acei / arb in all 3 models . cohen et al stated that " sicker patients will almost invariably be less likely to receive aceis / arbs . " as we reported , after matching , the baseline characteristics of the acei / arb group and nonuser group were largely comparable , while the remaining imbalanced variables were further adjusted . we agree with cohen et al that there might be some unmeasured confounders . as such , we performed an e - value and 2 other sensitivity analyses to further assess the robustness of the conclusion . the results remained consistent and statistically significant in these sensitivity analyses for both mixed - effect cox and propensity score - matched models . regarding the proportion of acei / arb users , however , the calculation by cohen et al was inappropriate . in china , the therapeutic ratio of hypertension was only 40.7 % , and acei / arb was used only in 25 % to 30 % among those patients . 2 in our study , this proportion was 25.2 % , which was consistent with that for the general hypertensive patients in china . thus , the concern from cohen et al regarding the lower - than - expected number of patients taking acei / arb was not correct . about the immortal time bias mentioned by cohen et al , we agree that a longer - term and stable exposure to acei / arb would further solidify their association with covid-19 mortality . unfortunately , as we clearly acknowledged in our original article , prehospital medications were not available in the in - hospital electronic record systems due to the urgent circumstance of the covid-19 pandemic . we agree that this potential immortal time - related bias may still exist as an inherent limitation of an observational study even after rigorous matching and adjustment . more recently , rentsch et al 3 reported a retrospective study including 2 026 227 veterans from the united states but did not find a significant association between acei / arb use and the need for intensive care in patients with however , they did not analyze whether the use of acei / arb was associated with mortality . the complex composition and obvious confounders ( eg , ethnicity , comorbidities , severity , and in - hospital medications ) of this large - scale cohort may have significant impact on this conclusion , which , however , was not matched or rigorously adjusted . another recent jama report including 5700 patients with covid-19 in the new york city also included the data of acei / arb usage . 4 the mortality rates for patients with hypertension taking acei ( 32.7 % ) , or taking arb ( 30.6 % ) , or not taking acei or arb ( 26.7 % ) were calculated . unfortunately ,

4b17934f88f73e2414aab28cd49dd50e67915d34	an urgent demand of assessing passengers ' exposure risks in airliner cabins was raised as commercial airliners are one of the major media that carrying and transmitting infectious disease worldwide . in this study , simulations were conducted using a boeing 737 cabin model to study the transport characteristics of airborne droplets and the associated infection risks of passengers . the numerical results of the airflow field were firstly compared against the experimental data in the literature to validate the reliability of the simulations . airborne droplets were assumed to be released by passengers through coughing and their transport characteristics were modelled using the lagrangian approach . numerical results found that the particle travel distance was very sensitive to the release locations , and the impact was more significant along the longitudinal and horizontal directions . particles released by passengers sitting next to the windows could travel much further than the others . a quantifiable approach was then applied to assess the individual infection risks of passengers . the key particle transport information such as the particle residence time yielded from the lagrangian tracking process was extracted and integrated into the wells - riley equation to estimate the risks of infection . compared to the eulerian - based approach , the lagrangian - based approach presented in this study is more robust as it addresses both the particle concentration and particle residence time in the breathing zone of every individual passenger . 
4b3ab0475496277336ed686539bb05e7b65854d7	covid-19 disease with a high rate of contagious and highly nonspecific symptoms , is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus . most people who fall sick with covid-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms such as respiratory symptoms , cough , dyspnea , fever , and viral pneumonia and recover without any special cure . however , some others need special and emergency treatment to get rid of this widespread disease . till now , there are numbers of proposed novel compounds as well as standards therapeutics agent existed for other conditions seems to have efficacy against the 2019-ncov. some which are being tested for mers - cov and sars - cov are validated that could be also efficient against this new coronavirus . however , there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations introduced for 2019-ncov specifically that be supported by highlevel evidence . the main purpose of this paper is to review typical and ongoing treatments for coronavirus disease including home remedies , herbal medicine , chemical drugs , plasma therapy , and also vaccinies . in this regards , famous herbal medicines and common chemical drugs which are routinely to be prescribed for patients are introduced . moreover , a section is assigned to the drug interactions and some outdated drugs which have been proved to be inefficient . we hope that this work could pave the way for researchers to develop faster and more reliable methods for earlier treatment of patients and rescue more people .

4b72bc09e112441f66281556728d4b02f86b16eb	presently , covid-19 has posed a serious threat to researchers , scientists , health professionals , and administrations around the globe from its detection to its treatment . the whole world is witnessing a lockdown like situation because of covid-19 pandemic . persistent efforts are being made by the researchers to obtain the possible solutions to control this pandemic in their respective areas . one of the most common and effective methods applied by the researchers is the use of ct - scans and x - rays to analyze the images of lungs for covid-19 . however , it requires several radiology specialists and time to manually inspect each report which is one of the challenging tasks in a pandemic . in this paper , we have proposed a deep learning neural network - based method ncovnet , an alternative fast screening method that can be used for detecting the covid-19 by analyzing the x - rays of patients which will look for visual indicators found in the chest radiography imaging of covid-19 patients . 
4b92d46245d381baf3f129821749af720d65e34d	in early 2020 , cities across china enacted strict social distancing measures to contain emerging coronavirus ( covid-19 ) outbreaks . we estimated the speed with which these measures contained community transmission in each of 58 chinese cities . on average , containment was achieved 7.83 days ( sd 6.79 days ) after the implementation of social distancing interventions , with an average reduction in the reproduction number ( r t ) of 54.3 % ( sd 17.6 % ) over that time period . a single day delay in the implementation of social distancing led to a 2.41 ( 95 % ci : 0.97 , 3.86 ) day delay in containment . swift social distancing interventions may thus achieve rapid containment of newly emerging covid-19 outbreaks . 
4b9d87001b5c14cd1388a57dae583d2207823075	in this paper we take up three terms -containment , delay , mitigation -that have been used by the uk government to describe their phased response to the covid-19 pandemic . although the terms refer to a political and public health strategy -contain the virus , flatten the peak of the epidemic , mitigate its effects -we offer a psychosocial reading that draws attention to the relation between time and care embedded in each term . we do so to call for the development of a form of care - ful attention under conditions that tend to prompt action rather than reflection , closing down time for thinking . using adriana notion of ' horrorism ' , in which violence is enacted cavarero 's at precisely the point that care is most needed , we discuss the ever - present possibility of failures acts of care . we argue that dwelling in the within temporality of delay can be understood as an act of care if delaying allows us to pay care - ful attention to violence . we then circle back to a point in twentieth - century history -world war ii -that was also concerned with an existential threat requiring a response from a whole population . our purpose is not to invoke a fantasised narrative of ' blitz spirit ' , but to suggest that the british psychoanalytic tradition born of that moment offers resources for understanding how to keep thinking while ' under fire ' through containing unbearable anxiety and the capacity for violence in the intersubjective space and time between people . in conditions of lockdown and what will be a long and drawn - out ' after life ' of covid-19 , this commitment to thinking in and with delay and containment might help to inhabit this time of waiting -waiting that is the management and mitigation of a future threat , but also a time of care in and for the present .

4d64fdae4e12b2123320d7e7e8b16b94c19e6ac1	previous work shows that the mean first - passage time ͑mfpt͒ for random walks to a given hub node ͑node with maximum degree͒ in uncorrelated random scale - free networks is closely related to the exponent ␥ of power - law degree distribution p͑k͒ϳk − ␥ , which describes the extent of heterogeneity of scale - free network structure . however , extensive empirical research indicates that real networked systems also display ubiquitous degree correlations . in this paper , we address the trapping issue on the koch networks , which is a special random walk with one trap fixed at a hub node . the koch networks are power - law with the characteristic exponent ␥ in the range between 2 and 3 , they are either assortative or disassortative . we calculate exactly the mfpt that is the average of first - passage time from all other nodes to the trap . the obtained explicit solution shows that in large networks the mfpt varies lineally with node number n , which is obviously independent of ␥ and is sharp contrast to the scaling behavior of mfpt observed for uncorrelated random scale - free networks , where ␥ influences qualitatively the mfpt of trapping problem . as a fundamental dynamical process , random walks have received considerable interest from the scientific community . recent work shows that the key quantity - mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) for random walks to a given hub node ( node with highest degree ) on uncorrelated random scale - free networks - is qualitatively reliant on the heterogeneity of network structure . however , in addition to the power - law behavior , most real systems are also characterized by degree correlations . in this paper , we study random walks on a family of recently proposed networks - koch networks that are transformed from the well - known koch curves and have simultaneously powerlaw degree distribution and degree correlations with the power exponent of degree distribution lying between 2 and 3 . we explicitly determine the mfpt , i.e. , the average of first - passage time to a target hub node averaged over all possible starting positions , and show that the mfpt varies linearly with node number , independent of the inhomogeneity of network structure . our result indicates that the heterogeneous structure of koch networks has little impact on the scaling of mfpt in the network family , which is in contrast with the result of mfpt previously reported for uncorrelated stochastic scale - free graphs . a͒ electronic 
4d69cb1dd202569b16047de0d8ef3b7ac3b76310	background : japanese encephalitis virus ( jev ) has a significant impact on public health throughout asia , and there is a pressing need for development of new therapeutics against it . methods : peptide - conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers ( ppmos ) are antisense agents that enter cells readily and interfere with gene expression . four ppmos , targeting various locations in the jev genome , were evaluated for antiviral activity against jev in cultured cells and the mouse model of jev infection . results : a ppmo ( p10882 ) targeting the jev 3 ′ cyclization sequence ( 3 ′ csi ) had significant antiviral activity in vero ( epithelial ) , neuro2a ( neuronal ) and j774e ( macrophage ) cells at concentrations that were not cytotoxic . p10882 added before infection suppressed jev replication to an undetectable level in vero cells and produced a 93 % and 66 % reduction in titre in j774e and neuro2a cells , respectively , when measured at 24 h postinfection . in uninfected cells , fluorescein - labelled ppmos entered j774e cells most efficiently , followed by vero and neuro2a cells . the antiviral effect of p10882 was also demonstrated in vivo , where 60 % -80 % of 1-week - old mice treated intracerebrally with a 20 mg / kg dose of p10882 every 12 h for 5 days were protected from a lethal dose of jev and showed an undetectable level of virus in brain tissue at 2 days post - infection . conclusions : p10882 , which targets sequence that is highly conserved across members of the jev serocomplex , was previously shown to be effective in a mouse model of west nile disease , and represents a candidate antiviral agent against members of the jev serocomplex . 
4e84f6a67b0cb8087b5948f5b161bdd66d565c48	due to the recent outbreak of covid-19 , many governments suspended outdoor activities and imposed social distancing policies to prevent the transmission of sars - cov-2 . these measures have had severe impact on the economy and peoples ' daily lives . an alternative to widespread lockdowns is effective contact tracing during an outbreak 's early stage . however , mathematical models ( e.g. , [ 24 ] ) suggest that epidemic control for sars - cov-2 transmission with manual contact tracing is implausible . to reduce the effort of contact tracing , many digital contact tracing projects ( e.g. , pepp - pt [ 7 ] , dp-3 t [ 34 ] , tcn [ 8 ] , bluetrace [ 13 ] , google / apple exposure notification [ 4 ] , and east / west coast pact [ 6 , 17 ] ) are being developed to supplement manual contact tracing . however , digital contact tracing has drawn scrutiny from privacy advocates , since governments or other parties may attempt to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance . as a result , many digital contact tracing projects build privacy - preserving mechanisms to limit the amount of privacy - sensitive information leaked by the protocol . in this paper , we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks , specifically dos attacks , and present blindsignedids , a privacypreserving digital contact tracing mechanism , which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers to limit the effectiveness of mac - compliant dos attacks . in our evaluations , we showed blindsignedid can effectively deny bogus ephids , mitigating dos attacks on the local storage beyond 90 % of stored ephids . our ex - ample dos attacks showed that using 4 attackers can cause the gigabyte level dos attacks within normal working hours and days .

4fc6644d7e69edea8aab46db3e152a9061c99a2f	coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) that emerged as a health problem worldwide . it seems that covid-19 is more lethal for iranian veterans with a history of exposure to mustard gas . there are some similarities in the pathogenesis of sars - cov-2 and mustard gas in immune system disruption and pulmonary infection . sars - cov-2 and mustard gas inducing oxidative stress , immune system dysregulation , cytokine storm , and overexpression of angiotensin - converting enzyme ii ( ace2 ) receptor in lungs that act as functional entry receptors for sars - cov-2 . moreover , iranian survivors of mustard gas exposure are more susceptible and vulnerable to covid-19 . it is suggested that the principles of covid-19 infection prevention and control be adhered to more stringently in iranian survivors of mustard gas exposure than others who have not been exposed to mustard gas . therefore , in this review , we discuss the different pathologic aspects of lung injury caused by mustard gas and also the relationship between this damage and the increased susceptibility of iranian mustard gas exposed survivors to covid-19 . 
503720a53e5c63f6d99b150d92268eedb180dc9a	policy decisions about public health services differ from those for personal health services . both require trade - offs between such policy goals as liberty , security , efficiency , and equity . in public health , however , decisions about who will approve , pay for , and deliver services are often accompanied by decisions on when and how to compel individual behaviour . policy becomes complex because different stakeholders interpret evidence differently : stakeholders may assign different weights to policy goals and may even define the same goals differently . in the debate over mandatory annual influenza vaccination for health care workers , for example , proponents as well as opponents of mandatory vaccination may convey arguments in security terms . those in favour of mandatory vaccination emphasize subclinical infections and duty of care ( public security ) while those opposed emphasize risk of adverse events ( personal security ) . proponents assert less worker absenteeism ( efficiency ) while opponents stress coercion and alternate personal infection control measures ( liberty and individual rights / responsibilities ) . consequently , stakeholders talk past each other . determining the place of mandatory influenza vaccination for health care workers thus demands reconciling policy trade - offs and clarifying the underlying disputes hidden in the language of the policy debate .

51678579179185c61f5d66b64b11afccff937858	the unprecedented global pandemic of covid-19 is currently occupying the attention of physicians worldwide . this disease caused by the novel coronavirus , now designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) is primarily an upper respiratory tract infection . however , it does impact on all specialties as medical organisations are redirected to fight the infection . the impact of covid-19 on gastroenterology is multifaceted . firstly , the effect of virus sars - cov-2 is there on the gi tract . 1 secondly , there is the effect of the highly infectious agent on the ongoing care of gi and liver patients , particularly at endoscopy where close contact with the patient may result in potential contamination . finally there is the effect of the redirection of healthcare priorities and the negative impact it may have on many important gastroenterology services . sars - cov-2 is an enveloped , single - stranded rna virus be- 
521b8f72592093c1d8aa63039b88c54df83f4d3f	chloroquine ( cq ) is a weak base that was originally used to treat malaria infection . 1 however , recent findings have pinpointed the modulatory effect of cq in models of chronic inflammation and viral infections . the antiviral effect of cq and its derivative hydroxychloroquine has attracted great attention due to the recent sars - cov-2 virus outbreak . 2,3 as an immunomodulatory agent , cq reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( eae ) , likely by inducing regulatory t cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells ( dcs ) . 4,5 eae and multiple sclerosis ( ms ) are demyelinating disorders of the cns in which interleukin ( il)-17-producing helper t ( th17 ) cells play a major role in disease severity . to date , there has been no report of the effect of cq on t cell differentiation ; thus , we aimed to investigate whether cq interferes with th17 cell differentiation . we isolated cd4 + t cells from the spleens of wild - type ( wt ) c57bl/6 mice and activated the cells with agonistic anti - cd3/ cd28 antibodies under th17 polarizing conditions in the presence or absence of cq . we found that cultures with cq had a significant decrease in il-17 production ( fig . 1a ) . moreover , cq at low concentrations was toxic to th17 cells but not to th1 cells or dcs ( fig . 1b ) . indeed , cq augmented th1 cell differentiation ( fig . 1b ) . these results show that th17 cells are more susceptible to cq toxicity than th1 cells and dcs . we then investigated whether cq also impacts tc17 cell differentiation and found that il-17 production by cd8 + t cells was also reduced by cq treatment ( fig . 1c ) . because t - bet and stat1 are major suppressors of th17 cell differentiation , 6,7 we aimed to investigate t - bet and stat1 expression in cq - treated cells . cultures of cq - treated th17 cells with the least toxic dose of cq had a significant increase in t - bet but not stat1 expression ( fig . 1d ) . this result is interesting because we recently showed that cq - induced tolerogenic dcs rely on stat1 expression to maintain their suppressive function . 8 collectively , our current results indicate that , in t cells , cq suppresses th17 cell differentiation by stimulating t - bet rather than stat1 expression . finally , we investigated whether eae suppression in cqtreated mice is associated with an increase in t - bet expression in th17 cells . we immunized wt mice with mog 35 - 55 peptide in complete freund 's adjuvant to induce eae and monitored the mice daily for disease development . cq treatment started once the mice showed the first signs of eae ( approximately day 10 p.i . ) and continued for 7 consecutive days . similar to what we previously published , 4 cq - treated mice displayed significantly less severe eae than pbs - treated mice ( fig . 1e ) . analysis of cns cells at day 21 p.i . revealed that cq - treated mice had a significant decrease in il-17-producing th17 cells and no effect on ifn - γ - producing th1 cells compared with cells from pbstreated mice ( fig . 1f ) . further analyses showed that stat1 expression was unchanged , while t - bet expression was increased in th17 cells in the cns of cq - treated mice compared with those treated with pbs ( fig . 1 g ) . collectively , our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which cq reduces inflammation in eae through inducing t - bet expression in t cells and reducing th17 differentiation . interestingly , the shift in the balance between th17 / th1 cells towards ifnγ production may reflect another pathway by which cq augments antiviral responses . nevertheless , further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis . our results provide further evidence that cq may be a powerful therapeutic agent in ms and the other chronic inflammatory diseases of the cns . 
526625cf5000ab29d70641c70564d1f49b42946a	the ongoing sars - cov-2 pandemic has caused large outbreaks around the world and every heavily affected community has experienced a substantial strain on the health care system and a high death toll . communities therefore have to monitor the incidence of covid-19 carefully and attempt to project the demand for health care . to enable such projections , we have developed an interactive web application that simulates an age - structured seir model with separate compartments for severely and critically ill patients . the tool allows the users to modify most parameters of the model , including age specific assumptions on severity . infection control and mitigation measures that reduce transmission can be specified , as well as age - group specific isolation . the simulation of the model runs entirely on the client side in the browser ; all parameter settings and results of the simulation can be exported for further downstream analysis . the tool is available at covid19-scenarios.org and the source code at github.com

52ab5a88deeaf66cac9068488b1acfff454eea2f	aims : covid-19 is now a global pandemic . at the time of survey , fewer than 150 children in australia and new zealand had documented infection . the aim of this study was to assess attitudes , readiness and confidence in the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic through an online survey of paediatric physicians and sub - specialists across australia and new zealand . methods : multiple email list groups were used to contact paediatric physicians to undertake an online likert scale survey between 17 and 24 march . respondents ' specialty , experience and work setting were recorded . ordinal logistic regression was used to determine respondent factors . results : there were 542 respondents from across australia and new zealand : an estimated 11 % of the paediatric physician workforce . a minority ( 36.6 % ) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated ; the majority ( 92.7 % ) agreed that senior - level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously . most reported a good understanding of the natural history of covid-19 in children , and knowledge of where to find local information . a large proportion of physicians ( 86.1 % ) were worried about becoming infected through their work ; few ( 5.8 % ) reported that they would not come to work to avoid infection . closure of school and childcares would reduce the ability to continue work at current capacity for 23.6 % of respondents . conclusion : despite limited experience in pandemics , most paediatric physicians felt informed . concern about exposure at work is common ; most were willing to work regardless . the closure of schools and daycares may have an impact on staffing . coordination and leadership will be critical .

52ef40cbfbd93f506eb4d57a15a7fac62a43e778	chronic cigarette smoking induces pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) by largely unknown mechanisms . renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) is known to function in the development of pah . losartan , a specific angiotensin ii receptor antagonist , is a well - known antihypertensive drug with a potential role in regulating angiotensin - converting enzyme-2 ( ace2 ) , a recently found regulator of ras . to determine the effect of losartan on smoke - induced pah and its possible mechanism , rats were daily exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months in the absence and in the presence of losartan . elevated right ventricular systolic pressure ( rvsp ) , thickened wall of pulmonary arteries with apparent medial hypertrophy along with increased angiotensin ii ( ang ii ) and decreased ace2 levels were observed in smoke - exposed - only rats . losartan administration ameliorated pulmonary vascular remodeling , inhibited the smoke - induced rvsp and ang ii elevation and partially reversed the ace2 decrease in rat lungs . in cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells ( pasmcs ) from 3-and 6-month smoke - exposed rats , ace2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats . moreover , pasmcs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3month exposed or control rats , and cells grew even more rapidly in the presence of dx600 , an ace2 inhibitor . consistent with the in vivo study , in vitro losartan pretreatment also inhibited cigarette smoke extract ( cse)-induced cell proliferation and ace2 reduction in rat pasmcs . the results suggest that losartan may be therapeutically useful in the chronic smoking - induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and pah and ace2 may be involved as part of its mechanism . our study might provide insight into the development of new therapeutic interventions for pah smokers . 
538da7be2912819fdff34d89d51560ae452ecc54	coronavirus mhv - jhm infections of rats provide useful models to study the pathogenesis of virus - induced central nervous system disease . to analyze the role of the immune response against defined mhv - jhm antigens , we tested the protective efficacy of vaccinia virus ( vv ) recombinants expressing either the nucleocapsid ( n ) or the spike ( s ) protein . a strong protection was mediated in animals by immunization with recombinant vv encoding a wild - type s protein ( vv - swildtype ) , whereas vv recombinant expressing a mutant s 3 5 4~~ protein ( vv - s354~~ ) had no protective effect . recombinant vv encoding n protein ( vv - n ) induces a humoral and a cd4 + tcell response , but did not prevent acute disease regardless of the immunization protocol . in these experiments , challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of mhv - jhm was performed prior to the induction of virus - neutralizing antibodies and studies with the anti - cd8 + monoclonal antibody , mrc ox8 showed that elimination of the cd8 + subset of tcells abrogates the protective effect . this result indicates that cd8 + tcells primed by recombinant vv expressing wild - type s protein are a primary mechanism of immunological defense against mhv - jhm infection in rats . 
53b037bc3483125f095c2ce8cde0040f57c55d64	various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person - to - person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic . so accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs . in this paper , we develop the model in dirk brockmann and dirk helbing ( 2013 ) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic , and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in china at the present stage using econometric approach . we found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic . nationally , social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures ; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect ; traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere . traffic control only works in cities with higher gdp per capita and population size , while fails in cities with lower gdp per capita and population size . in cities with lower population size , social distancing becomes inoperative ; the rapid and accurate transmission of information , a higher protection awareness of the public , and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects . the findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in china at present , at the same time , we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures , cooperating and complementing each other ; what 's more , measures should be formulated according to the city 's own situation , achieving precise epidemic prevention ; finally , we should increase the transparency of information , improve protection awareness of the public , guide emotions of the public in a proper way , enhancing public confidence .

540ccda8bb32d2b9192782b878cc2759da109212	the phosphoprotein ( p ) gene of most paramyxovirinae encodes several proteins in overlapping frames : p and v , which share a common n - terminus ( pnt ) , and c , which overlaps pnt . overlapping genes are of particular interest because they encode proteins originated de novo , some of which have unknown structural folds , challenging the notion that nature utilizes only a limited , well - mapped area of fold space . the c proteins cluster in three groups , comprising measles , nipah , and sendai virus . we predicted that all c proteins have a similar organization : a variable , disordered n - terminus and a conserved , a - helical cterminus . we confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant c proteins from tupaia paramyxovirus ( measles group ) and human parainfluenza virus 1 ( sendai group ) . we also found that the c of the measles and nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity , indicating a common origin . although the c of the sendai group lack sequence similarity with them , we speculate that they also have a common origin , given their similar genomic location and structural organization . since c is dispensable for viral replication , unlike pnt , we hypothesize that c may have originated de novo by overprinting pnt in the ancestor of paramyxovirinae . intriguingly , in measles virus and nipah virus , pnt encodes stat1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the c - terminus of c , indicating they have probably originated independently . this arrangement , in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif ( a stat1-binding site ) and a highly constrained region ( the c - terminus of c ) , seems paradoxical , since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt . the fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage , perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations . citation : lo mk , søgaard tm , karlin dg ( 2014 ) evolution and structural organization of the c proteins of paramyxovirinae . plos one 9(2 ) : e90003 . 
5411fcc705afb94a32bd3f1360455016b96bc4be	nowadays , the increasing number of patients accompanied with the emergence of new symptoms and diseases makes heath monitoring and assessment a complicated task for medical staff and hospitals . indeed , the processing of big and heterogeneous data collected by biomedical sensors along with the need of patients ' classification and disease diagnosis become major challenges for several health - based sensing applications . thus , the combination between remote sensing devices and the big data technologies have been proven as an efficient and low cost solution for healthcare applications . in this paper , we propose a robust big data analytics platform for real time patient monitoring and decision making to help both hospital and medical staff . the proposed platform relies on big data technologies and data analysis techniques and consists of four layers : real time patient monitoring , real time decision and data storage , patient classification and disease diagnosis , and data retrieval and visualization . to evaluate the performance of our platform , we implemented our platform based on the hadoop ecosystem and we applied the proposed algorithms over real health data . the obtained results show the effectiveness of our platform in terms of efficiently performing patient classification and disease diagnosis in healthcare applications . 
541e4b9cc19cdef991c78ff39e6ad79c1f5ecb09	the infectious pathway of the non - enveloped human papillomavirus type 16 ( hpv16 ) includes binding to the cell surface , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and penetration into an endosome . hpv16 infection was shown to decrease in the presence of the lysosomotrophic neutralizing agent ammonium chloride ( nh 4 cl ) . nh 4 cl neutralizes acidic endo - lysosome compartments , thus suggesting that ph was responsible for pv capsid conformational changes leading endosome escape . results : however , our data suggested that nh 4 cl blocked infection by preventing the movement of pv viral particles from the early endosome to the caveosome as was shown for jc virus [ 1,2 ] . we have confirmed that hpv 16 infection requires the trafficking of reporter - virions to the caveosome as is the case for bpv1 [ 3 , 4 ] . in this manuscript we propose that the observed decrease in infection of pv in the presence of nh 4 cl was due to a loss of movement of reporter - virions to caveosomes . we also demonstrate that cysteine proteases are involved in the infectious process , and that cathepsin b treatment of viral particles was shown to overcome the block of infection observed in the presence of furin inhibition . we confirmed the need for cathepsin b in hpv16 infection using cathepsin b null mouse embryonic fibroblasts . we present data that suggest hpv16 infection is in part mediated by cysteine proteases , and that nh 4 cl blocks the intracellular trafficking of infectious viral particles . to our knowledge this is the first demonstration that cysteine proteases influence the infection of a nonenveloped virus . 
543c6eae46487c76549cb4b347b8ea1b6994d9ac	in a short span , a novel coronavirus ( sars - cov-2 ) has captured global consciousness by significantly affecting the day - to - day life of humans and emerged as a public health emergency . undoubtedly , it indicates that lessons learnt from the past epidemics of coronaviruses such as the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , had not enough and thus left us ill - prepared to deal with the challenges that cov - id-19 pandemic is currently posing . currently , as a global pandemic , covid-19 poses major challenges and thus forcing the entire world to lockdown . however , the disease has prepared humankind in facing such outbreaks at present as well as in the future . besides , it has also taught numerous lessons that are worth considering and implementing to make the world a better reality . 
551b7cd62a524570056e48a1cb5235b937d1c313	the sars - cov-2 is a novel coronavirus identified as the cause of covid-19 , and as the pandemic evolves , many have made parallels to previous epidemics such as sars - cov ( the cause of an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [ sars ] ) in 2003 . many have speculated that , like sars , the activity of sars - cov-2 will subside when the climate becomes warmer . we sought to determine the relationship between ambient temperature and covid-19 incidence in canada . we analyzed over 77,700 covid-19 cases from four canadian provinces ( alberta , british columbia , ontario , and quebec ) from january to may 2020 . after adjusting for precipitation , wind gust speed , and province in multiple linear regression models , we found a positive , but not statistically significant , association between cumulative incidence and ambient temperature ( 14.2 per 100,000 people ; 95%ci : -0.60 - 29.0 ) . we also did not find a statistically significant association between total cases or effective reproductive number of covid-19 and ambient temperature . our findings do not support the hypothesis that higher temperatures will reduce transmission of covid-19 and warns the public not to lose vigilance , and to continue practicing safety measures such as hand washing , social distancing , and use of facial masks despite the warming climates . journal pre - proof r , total cumulative incident cases , and cumulative incidence rate . models were made using the latest data available , up to 18 may 2020 . covariates for models were selected a priori . all models were adjusted for wind gust speed , precipitation , and province . regression models were adjusted for the province where the health region was located to control for different social distancing and public health policies that may have journal pre - proof j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f been in place . statistical significance was defined where p - values were < 0.05 . all analyses were performed in r ( version 4.0.0 ) with the rms ( v6.0.0 ) and tidyverse ( v1.3.0 ) packages . 19 - 21 we observed 49 health regions across four canadian provinces that collectively made up 99 . 6 % ( 77,773 ) of canada 's covid-19 cases from january 25 to may 18 , 2020 . the mean ± standard deviation and range ( min - max ) for temperature was ( 1.48 ± 3.46 , -6.83 - 7.94 ) , wind gust speed was ( 43.5 ± 2.45 , 29.9 - 49.5 ) , and precipitation was ( 2.03 ± 0.78 , 0.44 - 3.72 ) . mean temperature and total precipitation tended to decrease at higher latitudes . the mean ± standard deviation and range for r and cumulative incidence were ( 1.27 ± 1.25 , 0.27 - 8.85 ) and ( 133.7 ± 100.4 , 15.8 - 415.7 ) , respectively . total cumulative cases and cumulative incidence rates tended to be highest in and around urban centres . after adjusting for wind gust speed , precipitation , and province , our results did not find a statistically significant association between temperature and r ( p=0.74 ) ( see table 2 ) . the multiple regression model , adjusted for wind gust speed , precipitation , and province , showed that per unit increase in temperature , there was an associated increase in covid-19 incidence cases of 14.3 per 100,000 people ( 95%ci : -0.20 - 29.0 ; p=0.07 ) , as shown in table 2 and figure 1 . however , this association was statistically nonsignificant . the association between temperature and cumulative incidence rate was further analyzed by province while adjusting for wind gust speed and precipitation . none of the province - specific regression coefficients for temperature reached statistical significance . 
55844fc8a5cb75ffa1a249436ad30d6d93792df5	background : on 31 march 2013 , the first human infections with the novel influenza a / h7n9 virus were reported in eastern china . the outbreak expanded rapidly in geographic scope and size , with a total of 132 laboratoryconfirmed cases reported by 3 june 2013 , in 10 chinese provinces and taiwan . the incidence of a / h7n9 cases has stalled in recent weeks , presumably as a consequence of live bird market closures in the most heavily affected areas . here we compare the transmission potential of influenza a / h7n9 with that of other emerging pathogens and evaluate the impact of intervention measures in an effort to guide pandemic preparedness . we used a bayesian approach combined with a seir ( susceptible - exposed - infectious - removed ) transmission model fitted to daily case data to assess the reproduction number ( r ) of a / h7n9 by province and to evaluate the impact of live bird market closures in april and may 2013 . simulation studies helped quantify the performance of our approach in the context of an emerging pathogen , where human - to - human transmission is limited and most cases arise from spillover events . we also used alternative approaches to estimate r based on individual - level information on prior exposure and compared the transmission potential of influenza a / h7n9 with that of other recent zoonoses . results : estimates of r for the a / h7n9 outbreak were below the epidemic threshold required for sustained human - to - human transmission and remained near 0.1 throughout the study period , with broad 95 % credible intervals by the bayesian method ( 0.01 to 0.49 ) . the bayesian estimation approach was dominated by the prior distribution , however , due to relatively little information contained in the case data . we observe a statistically significant deceleration in growth rate after 6 april 2013 , which is consistent with a reduction in a / h7n9 transmission associated with the preemptive closure of live bird markets . although confidence intervals are broad , the estimated transmission potential of a / h7n9 appears lower than that of recent zoonotic threats , including avian influenza a / h5n1 , swine influenza h3n2sw and nipah virus . conclusion : although uncertainty remains high in r estimates for h7n9 due to limited epidemiological information , all available evidence points to a low transmission potential . continued monitoring of the transmission potential of a / h7n9 is critical in the coming months as intervention measures may be relaxed and seasonal factors could promote disease transmission in colder months . 
558eec44990e2c8c43145a48bcae68219ae2ba52	background : from october 2010 through february 2016 , arizona conducted surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections ( sari ) among adults hospitalized in the arizona - mexico border region . there are few accurate mortality estimates in sari patients , particularly in adults ≥ 65 years old . the purpose of this study was to generate mortality estimates among sari patients that include deaths occurring shortly after hospital discharge and identify risk factors for mortality . methods : patients admitted to two sentinel hospitals between 2010 and 2014 who met the sari case definition were enrolled . demographic data were used to link sari patients to arizona death certificates . mortality within 30 days after the date of admission was calculated and risk factors were identified using logistic regression models . results : among 258 sari patients , 47 % were females , 51 % were white , non - hispanic and 39 % were hispanic . the median age was 63 years ( range , 19 to 97 years ) and 80 % had one or more pre - existing health condition ; 9 % died in hospital . mortality increased to 12 % ( 30/258 , 30 % increase ) when electronic vital records and a 30-day posthospitalization time frame were used . being age ≥ 65 years ( or = 4.0 ; 95 % ci : 1.6 - 9.9 ) and having an intensive care unit admission ( or = 7.4 ; 95 % ci : 3.0 - 17.9 ) were independently associated with mortality . conclusion : the use of electronic vital records increased sari - associated mortality estimates by 30 % . these findings may help guide prevention and treatment measures , particularly in high - risk persons in this highly fluid border population . 
568fec0df53acc098777e861ab6b824bf22ca3e4	the human gut mucosa is a major site of hiv infection and infection - associated pathogenesis . increasing evidence shows that natural killer ( nk ) cells play an important role in control of hiv infection but the mechanism(s ) by which they mediate antiviral activity in the gut is unclear . here we show two distinct subsets of nk cells exist in the gut , one localized to intraepithelial spaces ( iel ) and the other to the lamina propria ( lp ) . the frequency of both subsets of nk cells was reduced in chronic infection , whereas iel nk cells remained stable in spontaneous controllers with protective kir / hla genotypes . both iel and lp nk cells were significantly expanded in immunologic non - responsive ( inr ) patients , who incompletely recovered cd4 + t cells on haart . these data suggest that both iel and lp nk cells may expand in the gut in an effort to compensate for compromised cd4 + t cell recovery , but that only iel nk cells may be involved in providing durable control of hiv in the gut , users may view , print , copy , and download text and data - mine the content in such documents , for the purposes of academic research , subject always to the full conditions of use : 
5709e6d04771fd3207126fee6de4e7b607b6f21d	introduction : multicentric castleman 's disease ( mcd ) , a lymphoproliferative disorder associated with human herpes virus-8 ( hhv-8 ) infection , is increasing in incidence amongst hiv patients . this condition is associated with lymphadenopathy , polyclonal gammopathy , hepato - splenomegaly and systemic symptoms . a number of small studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the anti - cd20 monoclonal antibody , rituximab , in treating this condition . case presentation : we report the case of a 46 year old zambian woman who presented with pyrexia , diarrhoea and vomiting , confusion , lymphadenopathy , and renal failure . she rapidly developed multiple organ failure following the initiation of treatment of mcd with rituximab . following admission to intensive care ( icu ) , she received prompt multi - organ support . after 21 days on the icu she returned to the haematology medical ward , and was discharged in remission from her disease after 149 days in hospital . conclusion : rituximab , the efficacy of which has thus far been examined predominantly in patients outside the icu , in conjunction with extensive organ support was effective treatment for mcd with associated multiple organ failure . there is , to our knowledge , only one other published report of its successful use in an icu setting , where it was combined with cyclophosphamide , adriamycin and prednisolone . reports such as ours support the notion that critically unwell patients with hiv and haematological disease can benefit from intensive care . 
571ec1458866ae8ce9f2753aa468d45b0627c2f3	this chapter presents a new model of thinking for evaluating social development work . the social assessment framework put forward is based on tns stakeholder management model , tri*m , and focuses on the critical area of how aid and donor organizations can assess the effectiveness of social development programs . the millennium development goals have opened up a two way street between donors and beneficiaries and has provided for a need to look at social development assessment from a new perspective . the reader is taken through a journey of how the model came about , challenges faced during the process , and a vision for how the model will be used in the future . the two basic components of the model , the program effectiveness index and the tri*m grid for understanding program drivers , are explained . a case study covering the tsunami relief effort in aceh , where the model was used for the first time , is included as an example of how tns was able to deliver insight and clear direction in an otherwise complex environment . a client perspective is also provided both in terms of needs assessment and actions taken by unicef as a result . the chapter concludes with a reflection of what the future holds and the opportunity to apply the framework in other countries as well as for different situations . 
576bad43bf08b1a2d302695f5624a77fdbcaf6d0	was first discovered in 2012 . mers - cov can infect multiple host species and cause severe diseases in human . we conducted a series of phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses to study the evolution dynamics of mers - cov among different host species with genomic data . our analyses show : 1 ) 28 potential recombinant sequences were detected and they can be classified into seven potential recombinant types ; 2 ) the spike ( s ) protein of mers - cov was under strong positive selection when middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) is a novel beta - coronavirus with high pathogenicity , which imposes a serious threat to human health 1 . substantial evidence has showed that mers - covs have existed in central and east africa for decades 2,3 , and have many natural hosts including two species of bats ( neoromicia capensis and vespertilio superans ) , dromedary camel ( camelus dromedarius ) , and european hedgehog ( erinaceus europaeus ) 4 - 7 . yet it seemed that human mers - cov first isolated in saudi arabian in 2012 , and then spread among humans worldwide 8 . studies of prototype human mers - cov also suggested that the tmrca ( the time of most recent common ancestor ) of human mers - cov can be traced back to about 2011 9 . because the genome sequence of bat mers - cov is highly identical to that of human mers - cov , it has been indicated that human mers - cov might have a bat origin 10 , while there is also some evidence of camel - to - human mers - cov transmission 11,12 . together , these studies proposed that zoonotic event may play a nontrivial part in mers - cov evolution and transmission . previous studies showed that recombination was common among the members of beta - coronavirus 13,14 . by joining the previously unlinked dna , recombination event can create new viral strains which may be capable of infecting new hosts and evading host 's immuno - responses . the phylogenetic analysis showed that there were two main mers - cov clades - clade a and b , and clade b can be further divided into five phylogenetic groups 15 . there is evidence that recombination event had happened between group iii and group v 15 . however , whether there was potential recombination event happened between the other groups or among multiple phylogenetic groups remains unclear . the genome of mers - cov is over 30,000 nucleotides ( nt ) in length , which contains seven predicted open reading frames ( orfs ) and four structural genes - spike ( s ) , envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) , and nucleocapsid ( n ) 16 ( supplementary fig . 1c ) . the surface located spike ( s ) protein of beta - coronaviruses is one of the major determinants in their cross - species transmission because it mediates the virus - receptor recognition and thereby activates viral infection process 17 . additionally , the receptor binding domain ( rbd ) on s protein 's n - terminal is the key element for beta - coronavirus entering into host cells and the mutations in coronavirus 's rbd affects its infection and cross - species capability 18 , 19 . for example , the study of the spike protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) , another beta - coronavirus with high pathogenicity , revealed four amino

57bcd251e2d4f611eddf330ca913ba880dd94576	we examine here the outcome of viral encephalomyelitis [ mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) a59 , theiler 's encephalomyelitis virus , and coxsackievirus b3 ] in mice with autoantibodies to a central nervous system ( cns)-specific antigen , myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein , that usually develop no clinical disease . morbidity and mortality of the acute viral cns disease was augmented by the presence of the autoantibodies in all three viral infections . transfer of serum containing the autoantibodies at the time of infection with mhv was sufficient to reproduce the exacerbated disease . the presence of the autoantibodies was found to result in increased infiltration of mononuclear cells into the brain . early demyelination was severely augmented in brains and spinal cords of mhv - infected mice with cns - specific autoantibodies . the antibodymediated exacerbation was shown to be independent of the complement system but to require expression of fc receptors , because it was observed in c-3-deficient but not in fc receptor - deficient mice . our study illustrates the possibility that infections can lead to much more profound immunopathology in the presence of an otherwise latent autoimmune condition .

57bd23b3e3470ad1a6389bb584b5e16f1d907dfd	the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus encodes for eight accessory viral proteins with no known homologues in other coronaviruses . one of these is the 3b protein , which is encoded by the second open reading frame in subgenomic rna 3 and contains 154 amino acids . here , a detailed time - course study was performed to compare the apoptosis and necrosis profiles induced by full - length 3b , a 3b mutant that was deleted by 30 amino acids from the c terminus ( 3b 124 - 154 ) and the classical apoptosis inducer , bax . our results showed that vero e6 cells transfected with a construct for expressing 3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time - points . at all the time - points analysed , the apoptosis induced by the expression of 3b was less than the level induced by bax but the level of necrosis was comparable . the 3b 124 - 154 mutant behaves in a similar manner indicating that the localization of the 3b protein does not seems to be important for the cell - death pathways since full - length 3b is localized predominantly to the nucleolus , while the mutant is found to be concentrated in the peri - nuclear regions . to our knowledge , this is the first report of the induction of necrosis by a sars - cov protein . 
57cfb080e4dd271aa3e4977515d7d62ddf287d7a	a previously developed mechanistic model of covid-19 transmission has been adapted and applied here to study the evolution of the disease and the effect of intervention measures in some european countries and territories where the disease has had a major impact . a clear impact of the major intervention measures on the reproduction number ( r t ) has been found in all studied countries and territories , as already suggested by the drop in the number of deaths over time . interestingly , the impact of such major intervention measures seems to be the same in most of these countries . the model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections , active cases and future outcomes . while the predictive capabilities of the model are much more uncertain before the peak of the outbreak , we could still reliably predict the evolution of the disease after a major intervention by assuming the subsequent reproduction number from the current study . a greater challenge is to foresee the long - term impact of softer intervention measures , but this model can estimate the outcome of different scenarios and help to plan changes for the implementation of control measures in a given country or region . 
57d2f0345fb215ee80b39aedabaa55c45a5a1380	the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) is unfolding as a major international crisis whose influence extends to every aspect of our daily lives . testing is critical in identifying patients and carriers . effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined , thus reducing the spread of covid-19 , saving countless lives , and helping to restart the economy safely and securely . the testing capacity will remain a constraint for the foreseeable future compared to the size of the us population . the focus of this paper is to develop highly efficient testing strategies that make optimal use of our testing resources in order to minimize the number of infected individuals . developing a good testing strategy can be greatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers information about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine whom to test . there have been significant efforts to improve contact tracing by developing apps that leverage the ubiquity of smart phones to automatically detect contacts between individuals within a pre - determined distance from each other ( e.g. , within 6 feet ) , the time duration of the contact , etc . countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus typically use a " test , treat , trace , test " strategy that begins with testing individuals with symptoms , traces contacts of positively tested individuals via a combinations of patient memory , apps , wifi , gps , etc . , followed by testing their contacts , and repeating this procedure . the problem is that such strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources . this is especially the case with covid-19 , where symptoms may show up several days after the infection ( or not at all , there is evidence to suggest that many covid-19 carriers are asymptotic , but may spread the virus ) . such greedy strategies , miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare up in the future . in this paper , we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential learning - based resource allocation problem with constraints , where the input to the problem is provided by a time - varying social contact graph obtained through various contact tracing tools . we then develop efficient learning strategies that minimize the number of infected individuals . these strategies are based on policy iteration and lookahead rules . we investigate fundamental performance bounds , and ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as well as in the tests themselves . 
57f7587c21f25f1d1542599749ad28af764cf8e6	background : leptospirosis morbidity and mortality rates in china have decreased since the 2000s . further analyses of the spatiotemporal and demographic changes occurring in the last decade and its implication on estimates of disease burden are required to inform intervention strategies . in this study , we quantified the epidemiological shift and geographical heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis during 2005 - 2015 in china . we used reported leptospirosis case data from 1st january 2005 to 31st of december 2015 that routinely collected by the china information system for disease control and prevention ( cisdcp ) to analyze the epidemiological trend and estimate the burden in terms of disability - adjusted life - years ( dalys ) over space , time , and demographical groups . results : a total of 7763 cases were reported during 2005 - 2015 . of which , 2403 ( 31 % ) cases were the laboratoryconfirmed case . since 2005 , the notified incidence rate was gradually decreased ( p < 0.05 ) and it was relatively stable during 2011 - 2015 ( p > 0.05 ) . during 2005 - 2015 , we estimated a total of 10 313 dalys were lost due to leptospirosis comprising a total of 1804 years - lived with disability ( ylds ) and 8509 years - life lost ( ylls ) . males had the highest burden of disease ( 7149 dalys ) compared to females ( 3164 dalys ) . the highest burden estimate was attributed to younger individuals aged 10 - 19 years who lived in southern provinces of china . during 2005 - 2015 , this age group contributed to approximately 3078 dalys corresponding to 30 % of the total dalys lost in china . yet , our analysis indicated a declining trend in burden estimates ( p < 0.001 ) since 2005 and remained relatively low during 2011 - 2015 . low burden estimates have been identified in the endemic regions where infections principally distributed . most of the changes in daly estimates were driven by changes in ylls . conclusions : in the last 11-years , the burden estimates of leptospirosis have shown a declining trend across the country ; however , leptospirosis should not be neglected as it remains an important zoonotic disease and potentially affecting the young and productive population in economically less - developed provinces in southern of china . in addition , while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low - level , this might not reflect the true incidence of leptospirosis . strengthened surveillance in the endemic regions is , hence , substantially required to capture the actual prevalence to better control leptospirosis in china . 
58285ec3fbe337e244ececa569ec0eb569517b8b	background : substantial limitations have been imposed on passenger air travel to reduce transmission of sars - cov-2 between regions and countries . however , as case numbers decrease , air travel will gradually resume . we considered a future scenario in which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal . under that scenario , there will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases . we estimated the risk of different locations acting as sources of future covid-19 outbreaks elsewhere . we use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future covid-19 outbreaks . we use a probabilistic , branching - process based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at each location , accounting for local population density . under the scenario we model , we identify airports in east asia as having the highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks . moreover , we investigate the locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and potentially vulnerable to outbreaks : india , brazil and africa . we find that outbreaks in india and brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those regions . we find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions , such as the united states , europe , and china . however , outbreaks in africa due to imported cases are instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent . conclusions : variation in flight volumes and destination population densities create a non - uniform distribution of the risk that different airports pose of acting as the source of an outbreak . accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of outbreak risk can therefore facilitate optimal allocation of resources for effective targeting of public health interventions . 
58537f9ff98ac9e146885f38c33e246de8dc0ece	the features of autoantibodies ( autoab ) to liver fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase ( fah ) elicited in mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) were studied by elisa and western - blot competition assays . all sera tested contained ab to cryptic fah epitopes according with results from western - blot tests , whereas elisa data indicated that some of these same sera did recognize native epitopes of the autoantigen ( autoag ) . such differences were detected in individual sera from various mouse strains , and were ascribed to the fact that proteins insolubilized on solid supports expose a variety of conformational and cryptic antigenic determinants . on the other hand , whereas results from both experimental protocols showed that anti - mhv ab did not cross - react with the soluble autoag , the opposite situation did not show analogous results . thus , binding of autoab to insolubilized fah could be inhibited by mhv depending on the mouse serum or the experimental protocol used . additionally , a set of synthetic homologous peptides from mouse fah and various viral proteins was employed to analyze the ab repertoire of mhv - infected mice . results indicated that two homologous peptides were recognized by most ab : the n - terminal sequences ( 1e10 ) from fah and the nucleocapside , both sharing 50 % of identity , and sequence 2317e2326 of the rna polymerase , a peptide showing 30 % of identity with fah 11e20 . results indicated that mhv - infection triggers at least three distinct ab populations : anti - mhv , anti - fah and cross - reacting ab . this cross - reaction implies either sequential or conformational epitopes from both the viral proteins and the autoag and may differ between individuals .

dependent virulence , host cytokine 41 production , and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection 42 by respiratory viruses with great pandemic potential . we provide a first 43 demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza a virus-44 infected organ chip cultures and show that co - administration of the approved 45 anticoagulant drug , nafamostat , can double oseltamivir 's therapeutic time 46 window . with the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic , the airway chips were 47 used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition 48 in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the 49 organ chip platform . when administered in human airway chips under flow at a 50 clinically relevant dose , one drug -amodiaquine -significantly inhibited infection 51 by a pseudotyped sars - cov-2 virus . proof of concept was provided by showing 52 that amodiaquine and its active metabolite ( desethylamodiaquine ) also 53 significantly reduce viral load in both direct infection and animal - to - animal 54 transmission models of native sars - cov-2 infection in hamsters . these data 55 highlight the value of organ chip technology as a more stringent and 56 physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing , and suggest that 57 amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing . 58 confidential 59 the increasing incidence of potential pandemic viruses , such as influenza a virus , 60 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) , severe acute respiratory 61 virus ( sars - cov ) , and now sars - cov-2 , requires development of new preclinical 62 approaches that can accelerate development of effective therapeutics and 63 prophylactics . the most rapid way to confront a pandemic challenge would be to 64 repurpose existing drugs that are approved for other medical indications as antiviral 65 therapeutics . while researchers and clinicians around the world are attempting to do 66 this for the covid-19 pandemic , current approaches have been haphazard and 67 generally rely entirely on results of in vitro screens with cell lines . this has resulted in 68 equivocal results regarding drug efficacies and possible toxicity risks as in the case of 69 hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine 1 - 4 , and thus , there is a great need to address this 70 problem in a more systematic and human - relevant way . recognizing the potential 71 danger of unforeseen pandemics over two years ago , the defense advanced research 72 projects agency ( darpa ) and national institutes of health ( nih ) funded work to 73 explore whether human organ - on - a - chip ( organ chip ) microfluidic culture technology 74 might be helpful in confronting potential biothreat challenges . we previously showed 75 that organ chips can recapitulate human organ physiology , disease states , and 76 therapeutic responses to clinically relevant drug exposures with high fidelity 5 - 9 . here we 77 show how human lung airway chips may be used to model human lung responses to 78 viral infection in vitro , and in concert with higher throughput cell - based assays and 79 animal models , to identify existing approved drugs that have the potential to be 80 confidential repurposed for treating or preventing spread of viral pandemics caused by influenza a 81 virus or sars - cov-2 . 82 infections by respiratory viruses and antiviral drug screening assays are 83 currently studied in vitro using cultured established cell lines , primary tissue - derived 84 human cells , human organoids , and ex vivo human lung tissue cultures despite all 85 having significant limitations ( supplementary table 1 ) 10 - 13 . for example , established 86 cell lines commonly demonstrate various defects in their capacity to elicit an antiviral 87 state because normally elicited interferons cause cell cycle arrest , and so this dynamic 88 is often selected against with continuous passaging 14 . arguably even more important , 89 cell lines and even human primary cells grown in conventional cultures do not exhibit 90 the highly differentiated tissue structures and functions ( e.g. , mucociliary clearance ) 91 seen in living human organs . explant cultures of human respiratory tract tissue 92 circumvent this limitation , but their availability is limited and their viability can only be 93 maintained for a short time ( 4 - 10 days ) 12,15 . while human lung organoids provide a 94 more functional lung epithelium , they do not allow culturing of the epithelium at an air-95 liquid interface ( ali ) or modeling of other physiologically relevant organ - level features of 96 lung , such as mucus layer formation , mucociliary clearance , cross - talk between 97 epithelium and endothelium , or recruitment of circulating immune cells 10,11 , all of which 98 play key roles in host responses to infection by respiratory viruses . moreover , in all of 99 these culture models , drug studies are carried out under static conditions that can not 100 predict human responses to clinically relevant , dynamic drug exposure profiles that 101 result from complex pharmacokinetics ( pk ) in vivo . thus , there is an urgent need for 102 alternative preclinical in vitro models that specifically mimic human lung responses to 103 confidential infection by potential pandemic respiratory viruses , and because of their ability to 104 recapitulate human organ - level physiology and pathophysiology , human lung chips 105 offer a potential solution . sars - cov-2 s protein - dependent viral entry . 
5b01774c3d7d73d96e6f078e8859c4bba09b02a7	the case fatality ratio ( cfr ) is one of the key measurements to evaluate the clinical severity 15 of infectious diseases . the cfr may vary due to change in factors that affect the mortality risk . in 16 this study , we developed a simple likelihood - based framework to estimate the instantaneous cfr of 
5b13e81ee4495ff3eccaeea21f955ebc5e5cbde1	the main objective of this study is to apply autoregressive integrated moving average ( arima ) models to make real - time predictions on the number of beds occupied in tan tock seng hospital , during the recent sars outbreak . methods : this is a retrospective study design . hospital admission and occupancy data for isolation beds was collected from tan tock seng hospital for the period 14 th march 2003 to 31 st may 2003 . the main outcome measure was daily number of isolation beds occupied by sars patients . among the covariates considered were daily number of people screened , daily number of people admitted ( including observation , suspect and probable cases ) and days from the most recent significant event discovery . we utilized the following strategy for the analysis . firstly , we split the outbreak data into two . data from 14 th march to 21 st april 2003 was used for model development . we used structural arima models in an attempt to model the number of beds occupied . estimation is via the maximum likelihood method using the kalman filter . for the arima model parameters , we considered the simplest parsimonious lowest order model . we found that the arima ( 1,0,3 ) model was able to describe and predict the number of beds occupied during the sars outbreak well . the mean absolute percentage error ( mape ) for the training set and validation set were 5.7 % and 8.6 % respectively , which we found was reasonable for use in the hospital setting . furthermore , the model also provided three - day forecasts of the number of beds required . total number of admissions and probable cases admitted on the previous day were also found to be independent prognostic factors of bed occupancy . conclusion : arima models provide useful tools for administrators and clinicians in planning for real - time bed capacity during an outbreak of an infectious disease such as sars . the model could well be used in planning for bed - capacity during outbreaks of other infectious diseases as well . 
5b3fbfb0ff96a28c25c4d8926a1c034b2e48e02a	following the spread of the infection from the new sars - cov2 coronavirus in march 2020 , several surgical societies have released their recommendations to manage the implications of the covid-19 pandemic for the daily clinical practice . the recommendations on emergency surgery have fueled a debate among surgeons on an international level . we maintain that laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis , even in the covid-19 era . moreover , since laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not more likely to spread the covid-19 infection than open cholecystectomy , it must be organized in such a way as to be carried out safely even in the present situation , to guarantee the patient with the best outcomes that minimally invasive surgery has shown to have . 
5b6b23d6d9785a64c65390921c4270973d1a4455	coronaviruses ( cov ) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the 21 common cold to more severe diseases as middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers - cov ) and 22 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars - cov ) . the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 23 2019 ( covid-19 ) has become a public health emergency worldwide . sars - cov-2 , the virus 24 responsible for covid-19 , is spread by human - to - human transmission via droplets or direct 25 contact . however , since sars - cov-2 ( as well as other coronaviruses ) has been found in the fecal 26 samples and anal swabs of some patients , the possibility of fecal - oral ( including waterborne ) 27 transmission need to be investigated and clarified . this scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on cov in water environments . a 29 literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases pubmed , embase , and web 30 science core collection . this comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records , but only 12 31 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review . in detail , the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas : 1 ) cov 33 persistence / survival in waters ; 2 ) cov occurrence in water environments ; 3 ) methods for recovery 34 of cov from waters . the data available suggest that : i ) cov seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very 36 sensitive to oxidants , like chlorine ; ii ) cov appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water 37 than non - enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission ; iii ) temperature is 38 an important factor influencing viral survival ( the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 39 23 ° c-25 ° c than at 4 ° c ) ; iv ) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in 40 surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking - water ; v ) further 41 research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and 42 concentration of enteric , non enveloped viruses from water environments . the evidence - based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes 44 within the drinking and wastewater chain ( i.e. , water and sanitation safety planning ) to protect 45 human health from exposure to coronavirus through water . 46 47 48 49 50 51 61 of a wide spectrum of other diseases , such as conjunctivitis , respiratory symptoms , viral hepatitis , 62 infections of the central nervous system . 63 the most important waterborne enteric viruses belong to the families caliciviridae ( norovirus ) , 64 picornaviridae ( enterovirus and hepatitis a virus ) and adenoviridae ( adenovirus ) ( who , 2017 ) . 65 these viruses are often excreted at high titres in the faeces ( and occasionally , at lower 66 concentrations , in urines ) of infected humans ( rusinol and girones , 2017 ) . they have also been 67 detected from virtually all types of water : wastewater , seawater , fresh waters , groundwater and 68 drinking water and have been associated with drinking and recreational water outbreaks 69 4 ( bonadonna and la rosa , 2019 ; gall et al . , 2015 ; la rosa et al . , 2012 ; moreira and bondelind ; 70 rusinol , and girones , 2017 ) . 71 conversely , enveloped viruses , are structurally dissimilar to the enteric ( non - enveloped ) viruses , 72 and are believed to behave differently in water environments ( wigginton et al , 2015 ) . this group of 73 viruses includes families such as orthomyxoviridae ( es . influenza viruses ) , paramyxoviridae 74 ( measles virus , mumps virus , respiratory syncytial virus , etc . ) , herpesviridae , coronaviridae and 75 several others viruses . among the enveloped viruses , coronaviruses ( cov ) ( order nidovirales , 76 family coronaviridae , subfamily coronavirinae ) are single - stranded positive - sense rna viruses . 77 coronavirinae , includes four genera , alpha- , beta- , gamma - and delta - coronavirus , of which the 78 first two host viruses infecting humans ( human coronavirus , hcov ) : hcov-229e and hcov-79 nl63 ( alphacoronaviruses ) and hcov - hku1 , hcov - oc43 , middle east respiratory syndrome 80 coronavirus ( mers - cov ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) 81 ( betacoronaviruses ) ( cui et al . , 2019 ) . moreover , several coronavirus are reported to infect wildlife , 82 pets or livestock , such as in the case of bat coronaviruses ( batcov ) , porcine enteric diarrhoea cov 83 ( pedv ) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) , feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) , 84 bovine coronavirus ( bcov ) and others ( reviewed in wong , 2019 ; wang , 2019 ; tekes , 2016 ; amer , 85 2018 ) . 86 hcov are respiratory pathogens and their primary transmission mode is person - to - person contact 87 through respiratory droplets generated by breathing , sneezing , coughing , etc . , and contact ( direct 88 contact with an infected subject or indirect contact , trough hand - mediated transfer of the virus from 89 contaminated fomites to the mouth , nose , or eyes ) . waterborne transmission has never been 90 demonstrated in humans , however detection of hcov in the feces of infected patients has been 91 reported ( esper et al . , 2010 ; jevšnik et al . , 2013 ; risku et al . , 2010 ; vabret et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting 92 the fecal - oral route may contribute to hcov transmission . in 2003 , the sars - cov was detected in 93 the feces of infected patients ( isakbaeva et al . , 2004 ) and , during an outbreak in a residential 94 326 instead significantly higher ( 43.1 % ) . finally , the optimized ultrafiltration protocol adopted in the 327 study provided the highest recoveries for both viruses : 25.1 % for mhv and 55.6 % for phage ms2 . results of ye and colleagues suggested that the peg precipitation method , which is effective at 329 recovering non - enveloped viruses from water samples , may be not optimal for recovering infective 330 enveloped viruses , while ultrafiltration could be successfully applied for recovering cov. however , 331 in this study , only small volumes of wastewater were tested using centrifugal ultrafilters . since 332 viruses in water matrices may occur in very low numbers , there is a need for analytical methods 333 suitable to process large volumes of water . it was therefore concluded by the authors that further 334 progress could be made through the optimization of hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow 335 ultrafiltration to allow concentration of cov in waters from larger volumes of water . 336 abd - elmaksoud and coworkers ( 2014 ) measured the effectiveness of glass wool filtration to 337 simultaneously concentrate a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in 338 runoff from agricultural fields using dairy manure as fertilizer . viruses of bovine origin were used 339 to spike 20 liters of dechlorinated tap water , including bovine coronavirus ( bocov ) , bovine viral 340 diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 ( bvdv1 and bvdv2 ) , bovine rotavirus group a ( borv ) , and 341 poliovirus 3 ( sabin ) . moreover , e. coli o157 : nm , and campylobacter jejuni were selected as 342 bacterial pathogen . three water turbidity levels were evaluated , prepared by mixing dried 343 agricultural soil into the 20 liters of water . after glass wool filtration , elution was performed with 344 3 % beef extract - glycine buffer ( ph 9.5 ) , followed by flocculation with peg 8000 . recovered 345 organisms were enumerated by qpcr . results showed that glass wool filtration is a cost - effective 346 method for the concentration of several waterborne pathogens simultaneously . in details , the 347 average recoveries ( across the different turbidity levels tested ) were : 18.1 % for bocov , 22.1 % for 348 borv , 15.6 % and 19.7 % for bvdv1 and bvdv2 respectively . higher recovery efficiencies were 349 obtained for the non - enveloped virus poliovirus 3 ( 57.9 % ) , and for the bacterial microorganisms e. 350 coli o157 : nm ( 54.8 % ) and c. jejuni ( 32.7 % ) . however , the authors advised to use caution in the

5bd9a8cbba75c8ee241ee3870d02dbe437b6f60f	neurotropic coronavirus infection of mice results in acute encephalomyelitis followed by viral persistence . whereas cellular immunity controls acute infection , humoral immunity regulates central nervous system ( cns ) persistence . maintenance of serum ab was correlated with tissue distribution of virus - specific ab - secreting cells ( asc ) . although virus - specific asc declined in cervical lymph node and spleen after infectious virus clearance , virus - specific serum ab was sustained at steady levels , with a delay in neutralizing ab . virus - specific asc within the cns peaked rapidly 1 wk after control of infectious virus and were retained throughout chronic infection , consistent with intrathecal ab synthesis . surprisingly , frequencies of asc in the bm remained low and only increased gradually . nevertheless , virus - specific asc induced by peripheral infection localized to both spleen and bm . the data suggest that cns infection provides strong stimuli to recruit asc into the inflamed tissue through sustained up - regulation of the cxcr3 ligands cxcl9 and cxcl10 . irrespective of ag deprivation , cns retention of asc coincided with elevated baff expression and ongoing differentiation of class ii + to class ii -cd138 + cd19 + plasmablasts . these results confirm the cns as a major ascsupporting environment , even after resolution of viral infection and in the absence of chronic ongoing inflammation . 
5bfd9a40e27ada726f348a238e9509989780aedf	coronavirus ( cov ) infections are commonly associated with respiratory and enteric disease in humans and animals . in 2012 , a new human disease called middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) emerged in the middle east . mers was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus - erasmus medical center/2012 but was later renamed as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) . mers - cov causes high fever , cough , acute respiratory tract infection , and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals . the exact origin of mers - cov remains unknown , but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host , from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission . human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities . recent studies on middle eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus - host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome . in this review , we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of mers - cov. we have demonstrated that m , 4a , 4b proteins and plppro of mers - cov inhibit the type i interferon ( ifn ) and nuclear factor - κb signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune evasion . in addition , nonstructural protein 4a ( nsp4a ) , nsp4b , and nsp15 inhibit doublestranded rna sensors . therefore , the mentioned proteins limit early induction of ifn and cause rapid apoptosis of macrophages . mers - cov strongly inhibits the activation of t cells with downregulation of antigen presentation . in addition , uncontrolled secretion of interferon ɣ - induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 can suppress proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells .

5df04f27c3f80940bdfc868512ca5d8942c70bf1	although children 's health is not directly affected to the same extent as adults by the covid-19 pandemic , the measures taken by governments to restrain the spread of the virus have a big impact on children with disabilities and their families . on 12 march , the first measures were taken in the netherlands , including reducing medical therapies to focus on life - saving treatments in the hospitals . moreover , schools and day care centres were closed per 16 march . this meant that the majority of rehabilitation treatments taking place in schools , day care centres , hospitals and rehabilitation centres were postponed . however , the measures that were taken were not unambiguous . there was discussion about what therapies were - although not life - savingessential to prevent later adverse events , and the effects of school closing on child health . the dutch academy of childhood disability performed an inquiry among therapists and paediatric rehabilitation physicians in the netherlands to provide us with insight on the way the measures were interpreted and effectuated . starting 8 april , we conducted a survey study in which open questions were asked about the way the governments ' measures were interpreted and which therapies and care were considered essential and were thus continued . in total , 237 therapists and physicians working in rehabilitation units in hospitals , day care centres and rehabilitation centres responded . results of the survey show that there was large variation in the therapies and care that were continued despite the governments ' measures . whereas some clinics cancelled all therapies , others continued specific treatments such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing ( emdr ) and serial casting . we found that there was no unanimous interpretation of what urgent / essential care is . the most mentioned interpretation was ' care that , if postponed , leads to irreversible damage or functional limitations ' . therapists , together with physicians , decided whether treatments fit this definition . in all clinics and hospitals , treatments were continued by telehealth , where possible . as described by fazzi and galli ( 2020 ) , telehealth strategies were implemented quickly . the most important strategy was doing video consultations . our respondents were generally quite satisfied with this relative new treatment modality . however , despite the possibility of telehealth , therapists reported serious worries because some specific subgroups of vulnerable children and families proved hard to keep in touch with . moreover , they worried about children with progressive conditions . additionally , there were signs that the strain was high for some families , because physical therapy had to be delivered by parents themselves while healthy siblings were also at home and required attention . lastly , children who do not have a laptop or tablet computer can not take advantage of telehealth innovations , making differences between groups of children larger . these points underline the need to understand the increased risks for vulnerable children and how to minimize them with evidence - based service delivery . the lockdown also brought creativity and new ideas at light . implementing new technology suddenly was done faster than previously deemed possible , and many therapists found new ways to provide therapies , for instance , through instructional youtube videos , the use of short videos made by parents about specific problems at home , and pinterest pages with activities for children to be carried out . also , social media were used to maintain communication between therapists and to share ideas about telehealth strategies . good support for information and communications technology ( ict ) therefore proved an essential prerequisite for these digital solutions . these creative ideas might further support parental empowerment and involvement in the ( rehabilitation ) treatment in the future . the lockdown and postponement of therapy provide us with insight in the need for therapy by children with disabilities . the next months , we have the ability to reflect critically on what effects the change in therapy has on children with disabilities and on the way we provide services in the new situation . the discussion on ' best care ' could possibly get an extra impulse with these new findings in mind ( novak , 2020 ) . further research that has been started by the european academy of childhood disability should provide insight in the way parents and families themselves experienced the lockdown in european countries . we believe that despite all negative aspects of the covid-19 pandemic , we can and should learn from the innovations and transformations for the future . 
5e15233d1866349aee27a3feaeb00c8099984fbe	an ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the correlation between air pollution , and covid-19 cases and fatality rates in london . the analysis demonstrated a strong correlation ( r 2 > 0.7 ) between increment in air pollution and an increase in the risk of covid-19 transmission within london boroughs . particularly , strong correlations ( r 2 > 0.72 ) between the risk of covid-19 15 fatality and no2 and pm2.5 pollution concentrations were also found . although this study assumed the same level of air pollution across a particular london borough , it demonstrates the possibility to employ air pollution as an indicator to rapidly identify the city 's vulnerable regions . such an approach can inform the decisions to suspend or reduce the operation of different public transport modes within a city . the methodology and learnings from the study can thus aid in public 20 transport 's response to covid-19 outbreak by adopting different levels of human - mobility reduction strategies based on the vulnerability of a given region . one sentence summary : this study introduces air pollution levels as an indicator for a region 's vulnerability to covid-19 and suggests human - mobility reduction measures . all rights reserved . no reuse allowed without permission . author / funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . 
5e77269850b7b4bf57514e226ea66cd48ac31db5	the recognition of sialic acids by two strains of minute virus of mice ( mvm ) , mvmp ( prototype ) and mvmi ( immunosuppressive ) , is an essential requirement for successful infection . to understand the potential for recognition of different modifications of sialic acid by mvm , three types of capsids , virus - like particles , wild type empty ( no dna ) capsids , and dna packaged virions , were screened on a sialylated glycan microarray ( sgm ) . both viruses demonstrated a preference for binding to 9-o - methylated sialic acid derivatives , while mvmp showed additional binding to 9-o - acetylated and 9-olactoylated sialic acid derivatives , indicating recognition differences . the glycans recognized contained a type-2 galb1 - 4glcnac motif ( neu5aca2 - 3galb1 - 4glcnac or 39sia - ln ) and were biantennary complex - type n - glycans with the exception of one . to correlate the recognition of the 39sia - ln glycan motif as well as the biantennary structures to their natural expression in cell lines permissive for mvmp , mvmi , or both strains , the n - and o - glycans , and polar glycolipids present in three cell lines used for in vitro studies , a9 fibroblasts , el4 t lymphocytes , and the sv40 transformed nb324 k cells , were analyzed by maldi - tof / tof mass spectrometry . the cells showed an abundance of the sialylated glycan motifs recognized by the viruses in the sgm and previous glycan microarrays supporting their role in cellular recognition by mvm . significantly , the nb324 k showed fucosylation at the non - reducing end of their biantennary glycans , suggesting that recognition of these cells is possibly mediated by the lewis x motif as in 39sia - le x identified in a previous glycan microarray screen . 
5e7b080a27ccef247832c109e1b1863e1515b17e	graphical abstract highlights d herpesvirus - induced cytoplasmic mrna decay causes transcriptional alterations d the mrna decay - transcription feedback mechanism requires cellular decay factors d herpesviral genes escape mrna degradation - induced transcriptional repression in brief gamma - herpesviruses encode an endonuclease that induces cellular mrna degradation . abernathy et al . show that viral nuclease - triggered mrna decay leads to repression of cellular transcription and decreased rna polymerase ii ( rnapii ) recruitment . rnapii - transcribed viral genes escape this transcriptional repression , highlighting how viruses use this mrna decay - transcription feedback mechanism for their benefit . gamma - herpesviruses encode a cytoplasmic mrna - targeting endonuclease , sox , that cleaves most cellular mrnas . cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular 5 0 -3 0 mrna exonuclease xrn1 , thereby suppressing cellular gene expression and facilitating viral evasion of host defenses . we reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mrna decay by altering rna polymerase ii ( rnapii ) transcription in the nucleus . measuring rnapii recruitment to promoters and nascent mrna synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in sox - expressing cells . the transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial viral endonuclease - induced cleavage , but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases . in particular , xrn1 catalytic activity is required for transcriptional repression . notably , viral mrna transcription escapes decayinduced repression , and this escape requires xrn1 . collectively , these results indicate that mrna decay rates impact transcription and that gamma - herpesviruses use this feedback mechanism to facilitate viral gene expression . 
5ea003777403bda990fe5a2471273b477e529751	this experiment was conducted to evaluate whether pretreatment with fenofibrate could mitigate acute lung injury ( ali ) in a mice model of intestinal ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) . male c57bl/6 mice were randomly assigned into three groups ( n = 6 ) : sham , intestinal i / r + vehicle , and intestinal i / r + fenofibrate . intestinal i / r was achieved by clamping the superior mesenteric artery . fenofibrate ( 100 mg / kg ) or equal volume of vehicle was injected intraperitoneally 60 minutes before the ischemia . at the end of experiment , measurement of pathohistological score , inflammatory mediators and other markers were performed . in addition , a 24-hour survival experiment was conducted in intestinal i / r mice treated with fenofibrate or vehicle . the chief results were as anticipated . pathohistological evaluation indicated that fenofibrate ameliorated the local intestine damage and distant lung injury . pretreatment with fenofibrate significantly decreased inflammatory factors in both the intestine and the lung . consistently , renal creatine levels and hepatic alt levels were significantly decreased in the fenofibrate group . moreover , serum systemic inflammatory response indicators were significantly alleviated in the fenofibrate group . in addition , fenofibrate administration significantly improved the survival rate . collectively , our data indicated that pretreatment with fenofibrate prior to ischemia attenuated intestinal i / r injury and ali . acute lung injury ( ali ) is a critically severe , life - threatening condition in icu , characterized by high mortality of approximately 40 % 1 . ali , along with its more severe form , acute respiratory distress syndrome , often results from a massive insult to the lung , whether be the direct alveolar infiltration or the indirect effects of systemic inflammatory response syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndromes 2 . an effective treatment of this life - threatening disorder calls for a better understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of ali . the intestine is recognized to be one of the largest immune barrier systems and to be the source of bacteria and endotoxins in the body 3 . previous reports indicate that the intestinal organ plays a crucial role in the development of ali 4 . mesenteric artery ischemia , a commonly seen critical state during small bowel transplantation or trauma , may lead to intestinal ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) injury . during the process of intestinal i / r injury , local bacteria overgrow and translocate , gastrointestinal mobility decreases , and mucosal permeability increases , all of which subsequently lead to the local intestine damage or distant lung injuries through the activation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndromes 5,6 . intestinal i / r is , therefore , a useful model for the investigation of pathophysiological mechanism of indirect ali . fenofibrate is known as an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor -α ( pparα ) , the nuclear receptor superfamily member 7 . as a nuclear receptor activator , fenofibrate up - regulates or down - regulates genes that are involved in many pathophysiological processes , such as oxidative stress , inflammation , and leukocyte endothelium interactions 8 , 9 . recent studies have demonstrated an anti - oxidant , anti - inflammatory , and anti - ischemic role of fenofibrate to attenuate i / r injury in kidney 10,11 , liver 12 , brain 13,14 and heart 15 . but to date there are no literatures reporting the protective effects of fenofibrate in i / r injury in the organ of intestine . moreover , the functional significance of fenofibrate in the intestinal i / r - induced ali remains unclear . therefore , this experiment is aimed to investigate whether fenofibrate administration would ameliorate the lung injury and inflammation in the model of intestinal i / r injury . animals . the male c57bl/6 mice ( 8 - 10-wk - old ; 20 ± 2 g ) were purchased from charles river ( beijing , china ) . mice were kept in a temperature ( 21 ± 2 ° c ) and humidity ( 60 ± 5 % ) controlled room on a 12-hour light / dark cycle . they were fed a standard mice chow and water ad liblitum . all experiments were performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and were approved by the institutional animal ethical committee of the peking union medical college hospital .

5f72fd41d7ba8d4d7de7aa1f83fc5c90ffa50b03	the fourth outbreak of the coronaviruses , known as the 2019-ncov , has occurred in wuhan city of hubei province in china in december 2019 . we propose a timevarying sparse vector autoregressive ( var ) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland china over january 31 -february 19 , 2020 . our results demonstrate that the influential interprovince routes from hubei have become unidentifiable since february 4 , whereas the self - transmission in each province was accelerating over february 4 - 15 . from february 16 , all routes became less detectable , and no influential transmissions could be identified on february 18 and 19 . such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions , including the travel restrictions in hubei . implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak , virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages ( e.g. , jiangxi , henan and anhui ) to controlling the spread of 2019-ncov. 
5f73681fa27e986496cfdb67cb33e6d0d257618e	background : human rhinoviruses ( hrvs ) are often concurrently detected with other viruses found in the respiratory tract because of the high total number of hrv infections occurring throughout the year . this feature has previously relegated hrvs to being considered passengers in acute respiratory infections . hrvs remain poorly characterized and are seldom included as a target in diagnostic panels despite their pathogenic potential , infection - associated healthcare expenditure and relatively unmoderated elicitation of an antiviral state . objectives : to test the hypothesis that respiratory viruses are proportionately more or less likely to cooccur , particularly the hrvs . study design : retrospective pcr - based analyses of 1247 specimens for 17 viruses , including hrv strains , identified 131 specimens containing two or more targets . we investigated the proportions of co - detections and compared the proportion of upper vs. lower respiratory tract presentations in the hrv positive group . both univariate contingency table and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify trends of association among the viruses present in co - detections . results : many of the co - detections occurred in patterns . in particular , hrv detection was associated with a reduced probability of detecting human adenoviruses , coronaviruses , bocavirus , metapneumovirus , respiratory syncytial virus , parainfluenza virus , influenza a virus , and the polyomaviruses kipyv and wupyv ( p ≤ 0.05 ) . no single hrv species nor cluster of particular strains predominated . conclusions : hrvs were proportionately under - represented among viral co - detections . for some period , hrvs may render the host less likely to be infected by other viruses .

6435c0a4110baa3e744bd194ec02d26b2eed6fb4	we report very low sars - cov-2 seroprevalence in two san francisco bay area populations . 44 seropositivity was 0.26 % in 387 hospitalized patients admitted for non - respiratory indications 45 and 0.1 % in 1,000 blood donors . we additionally describe the longitudinal dynamics of 46 immunoglobulin - g , immunoglobulin - m , and in vitro neutralizing antibody titers in covid-19 47 patients . neutralizing antibodies rise in tandem with immunoglobulin levels following symptom 48 onset , exhibiting median time to seroconversion within one day of each other , and there is > 93 % 49 positive percent agreement between detection of immunoglobulin - g and neutralizing titers . 50 51 coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is a novel respiratory illness caused by the severe acute 52 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) 1 . the symptoms of covid-19 range from 53 asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death , and the covid-19 54 pandemic has resulted in substantial burdens on healthcare systems worldwide 2,3 . given the 55 current state of diagnostic testing which largely relies on molecular techniques , the 56 seroprevalence of sars - cov-2-specific antibodies in different populations remains unclear . 57 accurate and large - scale serologic testing that includes detection of neutralizing antibodies is 58 essential in evaluating spread of infection in the community , informing public health 59 containment efforts , and identifying donors for convalescent plasma therapy trials . we first assessed the performance of the abbott architect sars - cov-2 igg ( fda 64 emergency use authorization ( eua ) ) and igm ( prototype ) assays from a cohort of five 65 outpatients and 38 hospitalized patients at university of california , san francisco ( ucsf ) 66 medical center and the san francisco veterans affairs ( sfva ) health care system . these 67 assays are chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays that target the nucleocapsid and spike 68 proteins , respectively . all patients received care at adult inpatient units or clinics and were rt-69 pcr positive for sars - cov-2 from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab testing ( figure 70 1a , table s1 ) . the percentage of patients seroconverting for igg at weekly time intervals 71 following reported symptom onset reached 94.4 % at ≥ 22 days ( figure 1b ) . correspondingly , 72 igg assay sensitivity from analysis of all 423 samples increased weekly to reach 96.9 % at ≥ 22 73 days , and was 99 % when samples from seven immunocompromised patients ( see below ) were 74 excluded ( figure 1d , table 1 ) . the percentage of patients seroconverting for igm was also 75 94.4 % at ≥ 22 days ( figure 1e ) and igm assay sensitivity from analysis of 346 samples was 76 97.9 % ( 98.9 % with immunocompromised patients excluded ) ( figure 1 g , table 1 ) . 77 of the four patients who had not seroconverted for igg by the end of 14 days ( figure 78 1b ) , two were kidney transplant recipients on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil ( mmf ) 79 immunosuppressive therapy ; one was > 90 years old ; and one was an asymptomatic patient 80 receiving acute psychiatric care who provided an unreliable history . both renal transplant 81 recipients were observed to ultimately seroconvert for igg and igm. notably , delayed 82 seroconversion for igg and igm was not universal in immunosuppressed patients : three 83 additional solid organ transplant ( sot ) recipients on tacrolimus and mmf , as well as one patient 84 with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and infliximab , all seroconverted within two weeks . a 85 further sot recipient was positive for igg and igm in the earliest available serum sample from 86 day 17 post symptom onset ( figure 2d , e ) . we did not have samples beyond day 18 for the 87 remaining two patients . however , as seroconversion was observed as late as three weeks after 88 symptom onset ( figure 2d , e ) , it is possible that analysis of later samples would have 89 demonstrated detectable antibodies in their serum . the one patient who was still igg negative in 90 the 22 + day time frame ( figure 1b ) ( from a plasma sample collected on day 29 ) had only mild 91 symptoms and was positive by igm and neutralizing antibody testing ( described below ) . tested for igg ( n=1,013 ) and igm ( n=1,492 ) seroreactivity . two samples out of 1,013 were 98 positive by igg testing , yielding a specificity of 99.8 % ( 95 % ci : 99.3 - 100 % ) ( figure 1c ) , 99 concordant with the 99.9 % specificity reported in a study by the university of washington 4,5 . 100 similarly , testing of 235 remnant plasma samples from 163 sars - cov-2 pcr - negative ucsf 101 patients collected from late march to early april 2020 resulted in detection of only one positive 102 sample , yielding a specificity of 99.6 % ( 95 % ci : 97.7 - 100 % ) ( figure 1h ) . the igg positive 103 sample was from a patient admitted for syncope but who reported a cough of one - month 104 duration , suggesting a potential prior infection with sars - cov-2 . six samples out of 1,492 from 105 us blood donors were positive by igm testing , yielding a specificity of 99.6 % ( 95 % ci : 99.2 - 106 99.9 % ) ( figure 1f ) . this was consistent with more limited testing of 39 sars - cov-2 pcr 107 negative ucsf patients , none of whom were positive for igm antibody ( figure 1i ) . thus , the 108 architect sars - cov-2 igg and igm assays demonstrated high sensitivity ( 96.9%-97.9 % at ≥ 22 109 days in a primarily hospitalized patient cohort ) and specificity ( 99.6 - 99.8 % in pre - covid blood 110 donors ) , with good correlation ( rho = 0.65 ) between igg anti - nucleocapsid protein and igm anti-111 spike protein seropositivity ( figure 2a ) .

6534983caa7929d993d00f4b932394737fa41d5b	understanding the mechanism that leads to immune dysfunction induced by sars - cov2 virus is 2 crucial to develop treatment for severe here , using single cell rna - seq , we characterized 3 the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) from uninfected controls and 4 and cells in paired broncho - alveolar lavage fluid ( balf ) . we found a close association of decreased 5 dendritic cells ( dc ) and increased monocytes resembling myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdsc ) 6 which correlated with lymphopenia and inflammation in the blood of severe covid-19 patients . 7 those mdsc - like monocytes were immune - paralyzed . in contrast , monocyte - macrophages in balfs 8 of covid-19 patients produced massive amounts of cytokines and chemokines , but secreted little 9 interferons . the frequencies of peripheral t cells and nk cells were significantly decreased in severe 10 covid-19 patients , especially for innate - like t and various cd8 + t cell subsets , compared to health 11 controls . in contrast , the proportions of various activated cd4 + t cell subsets , including th1 , th2 and 12 th17-like cells were increased and more clonally expanded in severe covid-19 patients . patients ' 13 peripheral t cells showed no sign of exhaustion or augmented cell death , whereas t cells in balfs 14 produced higher levels of ifng , tnf , ccl4 and ccl5 etc . paired tcr tracking indicated abundant 15 recruitment of peripheral t cells to the patients ' lung . together , this study comprehensively depicts 16 how the immune cell landscape is perturbed in severe covid-19 . 17 : medrxiv preprint 20 the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) caused by sars - cov-2 has been spreading rapidly 21 worldwide , causing serious public health crisis . although most sars - cov-2 infected cases have 22 asymptomatic or mild - to - moderate diseases , around 10 % of those infected may develop severe 23 pneumonia and other associated organ malfunctions 1 . old age , the male sex and underlying 24 comorbidities are risk factors for causing severe covid-19 2 , however , the pathogenesis mechanisms 25 remains unclear . immune perturbations were thought to play crucial roles in the covid-19 26 pathogenesis . indeed , many reports showed that lymphopenia and increased blood cytokine levels 27 were closely associated with the development or recovery of severe covid-19 and proposed to treat 28 the patients by inhibiting cytokine storms 3 - 6 . 29 recent studies have revealed more aspects of different immune players in covid-19 infections . 30 although sars - cov-2 infection in host cells elicits robust secretion of chemokines and cytokines , it 31 only weakly induces the ifns 7 . in our earlier studies , we showed increased recruitment of highly 32 inflammatory fcn1 + monocyte - derived macrophages in patients ' balfs , suggesting their implication 33 in the cytokine storm 8,9 . intriguingly , t and b cell responses , and neutralizing antibodies recognizing 34 sars - cov-2 were detected among most of the infected patients , with higher levels in those with old 35 age and severe diseases 10 - 12 . the dysregulations of other immune cell compartments , such as 36 monocytes , dcs , and innate - like t cells are also likely present in severe covid-19 13 - 16 .

664d7e731b7c05c755822f71779cf372e1938890	wuhan coronavirus , called 2019-ncov , is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by january 30 , 2020 . currently , there is no effective treatment for this epidemic . however , the viral protease of a coronavirus is well - known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target . fortunately , the sequence identity of the 2019-ncov protease and that of severe - acute respiratory syndrome virus ( sars - cov ) is as high as 96.1 % . we show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-ncov and sars - cov are almost identical , which means all potential anti - sars - cov chemotherapies are also potential 2019-ncov drugs . here , we report a family of potential 2019-ncov drugs generated by a machine intelligence - based generative network complex ( gnc ) . the potential effectiveness of treating 2019-ncov by using some existing hiv drugs is also analyzed . 
669de8eb6d875a069cd9265f4378d9d7a51421e6	the aim of this study was to investigate clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens in 82 diarrheic dogs positive for canine parvovirus type 2 ( cpv ) . enterotoxigenic c. perfringens type a was isolated from three ( 3.6 % ) dogs . one ( 1.2 % ) strain was also positive for nete - and netf - encoding genes , which are commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs . toxigenic c. difficile was isolated from one animal ( 1.2 % ) , which was also positive for a / b toxins . the present study identified c. difficile and c. perfringens infection in cpv - positive dogs . further studies are necessary to clarify if clostridial infections may predispose or potentiate cpv - infection in dogs or vice versa .

6768d4f8950eb253b1ede0ca9750fb7c0fbd7e02	immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments are critical for the management of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis . like in those illnesses , the lung injury and acute respiratory distress shown in patients are the result of a disruption in the balance of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines . this hyperinflammatory response to sars - cov-2 , associated with the severity of the coronavirus disease , is called the cytokine storm . there is a growing concern regarding how patients on immunosuppressant biologic therapies might be at higher risk of being infected and whether they need to discontinue their treatment preemptively . clinical data on covid-19 infected patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis are still scarce . here , we presented seven cases of this type of patients . the patient infected with covid-19 on apremilast and the one on apremilast with infected spouse showed the best safety profile and mildest symptoms . one of the secukinumab patients also presented a relatively good outcome . infliximab patients and the one with serious comorbidities showed the worst outcome . even though more clinical data are yet needed to draw strong conclusions , apremilast could be a safer alternative for dermatology and rheumatology patients in case of clinically important active infection .

67ef4b8a1eaaf14328ad66f28e0f103c608e73d4	background : cells of the innate immune system including monocytes and macrophages are the first line of defence against infections and are critical regulators of the inflammatory response . these cells express toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , innate immune receptors which govern tailored inflammatory gene expression patterns . monocytes , which produce proinflammatory mediators , are readily recruited to the central nervous system ( cns ) in neurodegenerative diseases . methods : this study explored the expression of receptors ( cd11b , tlr2 and tlr4 ) on circulating monocyte - derived macrophages ( mdms ) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) isolated from healthy elderly adults who we classified as either iq memory - consistent ( high - performing , hp ) or iq memory - discrepant ( low - performing , lp ) . the expression of cd11b , tlr4 and tlr2 was increased in mdms from the lp group when compared to hp cohort . mdms from both groups responded robustly to treatment with the tlr4 activator , lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , in terms of cytokine production . significantly , mdms from the lp group displayed hypersensitivity to lps exposure . interpretation : overall these findings define differential receptor expression and cytokine profiles that occur in mdms derived from a cohort of iq memory - discrepant individuals . these changes are indicative of inflammation and may be involved in the prodromal processes leading to the development of neurodegenerative disease . 
681abe795769a807b043603ae723815aa57b00eb	1 bats are responsible for the zoonotic transmission of several major viral diseases including the 2 2003 sars outbreak and the ongoing covid-19 pandemic . while bat genomic sequencing 3 studies have revealed characteristic adaptations of the innate immune system , functional genomic 4 studies are urgently needed to provide a foundation for the molecular dissection of the tolerance 5 of viral infections in bats . here we report the establishment and screening of genome - wide rnai 6 library and crispr library for the model megabat , pteropus alecto . we used the complementary 7 rnai and crispr libraries to interrogate pteropus alecto cells for infection with two different 8 viruses , mumps virus and influenza a virus , respectively . screening results converged on the 9 endocytosis pathway and the protein secretory pathway as required for both viral infections . 10 additionally , we revealed a general dependence of the c-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene , 11 mthfd1 , for viral replication in bat cells as well as in human cells . mthfd1 inhibitor carolacton 12 potently blocked replication of several rna viruses including sars - cov-2 . our studies provide 13 a resource for systematic inquiry into the genetic underpinnings of bat biology and a potential 14 target for developing broad spectrum antiviral therapy . 15 16 17 as the only mammal capable of sustained flying , bats are intriguing animals with unique 18 behavioral and physiological characteristics . bats are notorious for transmission of deadly 19 viruses , causing the epidemics of the ebola 1 , sars 2 , henipavirus 3 , mers 4 and 6 . 20 bats are widely considered the largest reservoir of numerous virus species but are resilient to the 21 diseases associated with many of these viruses 7,8 . how bats tolerate the infections with these 22 viruses is of intense interest due to the scientific and public health relevance . genomic 23 sequencing studies have revealed several genetic adaptions underlying this tolerance of viral 24 infections . for example , the dna damage checkpoint pathway and the nf - kb pathway are 25 known to be positively selected in the bat genomes 9 . in addition , in the type i interferon gene 26 family , the mhc class i genes and natural killer cell receptor family have been reported to be 27 highly expanded in the bat genomes 10 . these studies provided evidence to support the hypothesis 28 that bats have evolved a highly specific genetic configuration , especially in the innate immunity 29 pathways . a major caveat is the lack of systematic examination of the functions of these genes 30 due to shortage of functional genomic tools . 31 3 crispr and rnai technologies have enabled genome - wide screening of gene functions for a 1 variety of cell types , yielding an unprecedented wealth of information revealing the complexity of 2 biological processes 11,12 . this is especially true in the field of virus - host interactions , where a 3 plethora of host factors have been identified for a variety of viruses [ 13][14 ] [ 15 ] . both technologies have 4 advantages and disadvantages and provide complementary approaches to achieve comprehensive 5 genetic perturbations [ 16][17][18 ] . crispr permits complete knockout of a gene , thus affords generation 6 of truly null genotype . a caveat is that the lethality associated with knockout of essential genes 7 prevents functional parsing of these genes in different biological processes . in addition , crispr 8 screening is usually used a pool - based format that requires the generation of stable cell lines 9 through long term culturing . therefore , crispr is suited for studying phenotypes that require a 10 longer time to manifest . based on previous studies , crispr screens demonstrated excellent 11 specificity but limited sensitivity 17 . in contrast , sirna screening relies on temporary knockdown 12 of genes in an individual well format , a methodology suited for examining short - term phenotypic 13 changes . due to the transient nature of the assay , sirna screening can tolerate growth defects due 14 to gene knockdown and can elucidate hypomorphic phenotypes induced by sirnas with varying 15 degrees of knockdown . in general , rnai screens allow comprehensive identification of genes in 16 a biological process at the cost of more false positives due to pervasive off - target effects 17 . to fully 17 realize the power of crispr and rnai screening as complementary strategies to interrogate gene 18 function in bats , here we developed a pool - based crispr library and a plate - based sirna library 19 for the whole genome of the model megabat pteropus alecto . we screened two viruses , influenza 20 a virus and mumps virus , using the crispr and rnai libraries , respectively , in the hope of 21 uncovering common host factors for different viruses . from these two screens , common pathways 22 such as the endocytosis pathway and protein secretory pathway have been identified , 23 demonstrating conserved pathways between bat and other mammals in hosting viral infections . 24 we extensively characterized a common hit from the two screens , mthfd1 , and identified it as a 25 critical factor for viral replication in both bats and humans . we further demonstrate that mthfd1 26 is a potential target for developing broad - spectrum antiviral drugs . mthfd1 inhibitor carolacton 27 demonstrated broad antiviral activities against zika virus , mumps virus , and importantly , sars-28 cov-2 . in summary , we developed two orthogonal libraries for genome - wide loss - of - function 29 screening in bats and demonstrated their utility in discovery of important host factors for viral 30 infections . 31 4 we designed and synthesized the crispr and rnai libraries based on the genome of p. alecto . 2 for the crispr library , we adopted the algorithm developed for the construction of the popular 3 gecko library to select single guide rnas ( sgrnas ) 19 . we designed 85,275 sgrnas targeting 4 21,334 genes annotated in the p. alecto genome with 21,330 genes with 4 sgrnas for each gene . 5 the other 34 genes have 1 - 3 sgrnas due to the constraints of the gene sequences for designing 6 sgrnas . selection of sgrnas was based on the calculations of off - target scores to lower potential 7 off - target effects of the sgrnas . the sgrnas designs were validated for 21 sgrnas targeting 11 8 genes using t7e1 endonuclease cleavage assay or western blotting . we observed 90.5 % of 9 effectiveness in gene editing or gene knockdown , supporting the quality of the designed library 10 ( supplementary figure 1 ) . 11 12 we performed a crispr screen with influenza a virus in paki cells to identify viral host factors 14 ( fig . 1a ) . paki cells stably expressing sgcas9 and sgrna library were infected with the h1n1 15 pr8 strain of influenza a virus , in duplicate . we used a high multiplicity - of - infection ( moi ) so 16 that naïve paki cells all died before the 9th day post infection . we then collected the surviving 17 cells and compared sgrna abundance with mock - infected cells . the two replicates demonstrated 18 a high correlation , indicating high reproducibility ( supplementary fig . 2 ) . we calculated the 19 results using the riger algorithm and identified 21 host factors required for the viral infection or 20 pathogenesis 20 ( fig . 1b ) . three of the top four hits belong to the v - type proton atpase subunits 21 ( atp6v1b2 , atp6v1f and atp6v0d1 ) , which are involved in the acidification of endosome 22 and have previously been previous identified as key host factors for influenza virus entry in several 23 screens performed in human cells ( fig . 1b ) 21 . among the other hits were two genes , copz1 and 24 sec23b , involved in the protein secretory pathway , which are also known to be required for the 25 replication of many viruses including influenza virus and flavivirus ( fig . 1b ) 21 - 23 . the enrichment 26 of previously known host factors in the identified hits in the crispr screen validated our library 27 and the screening methodology . 28 29 rnai screen results converge with crispr screening on key pathways 30 5 we synthesized the sgrna library in an array - based oligonucleotide library and cloned them into 1 the lentiguide - puro lentivirus expression vector 24 . a custom bat sirna library was designed to 2 target 18,328 genes using 40,016 sirna duplexes . we performed rnai screening in paki cells 3 for identification of host factors for the infection of mumps virus , a paramyxovirus ( fig . 1c ) . the 4 screen was performed in 384-well format with a mumps virus strain expressing egfp from an 5 additional open reading frame 25 . paki cells were infected 48 hours after transfection of the sirna 6 library . high - content imaging analysis was utilized to quantitate the infection rate as well as the 7 total cell number each well , indicating cytotoxicity of the sirna . excluding sirnas with 8 significant cytotoxicity , we selected 45 host dependency factors whose knockdown resulted in 9 significantly reduced viral infection and 45 host restriction factors whose knockdown promoted 10 viral infection based on the z score of infection rate ( fig . 1d ) . we selected a number of genes for 11 individual validation with more replicates and obtained a high validation rate ( 11/12 of host 12 dependency factors and 7/12 of the host restriction factors validated with at least one sirna ) 13 ( supplementary fig . 3 ) , supporting the reproducibility of our screening methodology . 14 15 although there is only one gene overlap between the host factors identified in both crispr 16 and rnai screens , we observed that the endocytosis pathway and protein secretory pathway were 17 enriched in both screens , albeit represented by different genes ( fig . 1b and 1d ) . for the 18 endocytosis pathway , two genes encoding components of clathrin complex , clta and cltc , 19 were among the top three hits ( fig . 1d ) . four genes involved in the protein secretory , namely 20 arf1 , arf4 , copg1 and sec61b , were identified ( fig . 1d ) . this is consistent with the idea that 21 both influenza a virus and mumps require the two pathways for viral replication . in addition , 22 protein translation initiation , which was previously reported to be required for influenza a 23 infection 21 , was also represented in the top hits by three genes : eif3b , eif3 g and eif4a3 . 24 the top hits were several known antiviral genes , trim39 , trim43 26 and nampt 27 . overall , we 26 identified many candidate genes that might play a role in viral infection in bats . 27 the two pathways identified by both crispr screen and sirna screen , endocytosis and 29 protein secretion , have previously been implicated in human host response to a number of viral 30 pathogens 13,21,23 to validate the role of these pathways in the bat response to viral infection , we 31 6 established paki stable cell lines expressing shrnas targeting several hits from the two screens . 1 stable knockdown of a v - type proton atpase subunit and sec23b led to a significant decrease 2 of influenza a virus infection in paki cells ( fig . 1e and 1f ) . in addition , the small molecule 3 inhibitor of v - type proton atpase , bafilomycin a ( fig . 1 g ) , potently blocked influenza infection . 4 taken together , these results demonstrate that bat and human cells share key genes and pathways 5 in hosting viral infection . 6 7 mthfd1 is a key host factor for a broad spectrum of rna viruses 8 the gene identified as a host factor from both the crispr and rnai screen was mthfd1 ( fig .   9    1c and 1d ) , which we validated by sirna knockdown in the context of mumps infection 10 ( supplemental fig . 3   with two different sgrnas targeting mthfd1 ( fig . 2a-2b ) . similarly , in hek293 t cells with 12 mthfd1 knocked out by two sgrnas , influenza replication is also inhibited , suggesting a 13 conserved requirement for this gene by influenza virus in human cells ( fig . 2c ) . further virus 14 titration assay demonstrated that mthfd1 knockdown significantly inhibits viral replication for 15 mumps virus in paki cells ( fig . 2d and 2e ) . the effect is similar to the knockdown of sec61b , a 16 well - studied host protein required for viral replication and a top hit in our rnai screen ( fig . 2d   17 and 2e ) 23 . we additionally tested melaka virus ( prv3 m ) , a pteropine orthoreovirus that causes 18 acute respiratory disease when transmitted by bats to humans 28 . prv3 m titer was also significantly 19 reduced by mthfd1 knockdown ( fig . 2e and 2f ) . infection of zika virus , a member of the 20 flavivirus family , was also inhibited by mthfd1 knockdown using sirna ( fig . 2 g ) . alternative 21 knockdown with stable expression of two shrnas validated the requirement of mthfd1 for the 22 replication of mumps virus and zika virus ( fig . 2h , 2i and 2j ) . importantly , we also show that this 23 inhibition is completely rescued by overexpression of mthfd1 from a construct resistant to the 24 shrna , ruling out potential off - target effects ( fig . 2k ) . 25 26 mthfd1 is a trifunctional enzyme involved in the one carbon ( c1 ) metabolism pathway , which 28 is responsible for cellular production of purine , dtmp and methyl groups 29 . mthfd1 has three 29 enzymatic functions including dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities encoded in the n-30 terminal domain and formyl tetrahydrofolate ( formyl thf ) synthetase activity encoded in the c-31 7 terminal domain ( fig . 3a and 3b ) . we suspected that mthfd1 knockdown would lead to the 1 deficiency of cellular purine levels thereby reducing rna replication . indeed , supplementation of 2 purine analogs , either hypoxanthine or inosine in the media almost completely rescued the 3 replication of influenza a and zika viruses in mthfd1-knockout or knockdown paki cells as 4 shown by both immunofluorescence staining and virus tittering assay ( fig . 3c , 3d and 3e ) . in 5 contrast , supplementation of methyl - group donor or thymidine had little effect on viral replication , 6 evidence that it is the purine synthesis activity of mthfd1 that is essential for the viral replication 7 ( fig . 3d ) . to further pinpoint the enzymatic function of mthfd1 in viral replication , we 8 performed gene complementation experiments in an shrna cell line with over 90 % knockdown 9 of mthfd1 ( fig . 2i ) . the block of zika virus replication in this cell line was completely rescued 10 by overexpression of an shrna - resistant mthfd1 construct or bat homolog ( fig . 3f and 3 g ) . 11 mutations of mthfd1 that are known to disrupt its dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities 12 ( d125a and r173c ) 30,31 did not affect this rescue ( fig . 3b , 3f and 3 g ) . however , mutations in the 13 formyl thf synthetase active site ( f759a / w788a , or fw / aa ) 32 completely abolished this rescue , 14 further supporting that the purine synthesis activity of mthfd1 is an essential activity for viral 15 replication ( fig . 3b , 3f and 3 g ) . 16 we observed a similar dependence on mthfd1 function for influenza a virus infection in 18 hek293 t cells , a human kidney epithelial cell line ( fig . 3h ) . time course experiments 19 demonstrated a viral replication following mthfd1 knockdown steadily decreased from four 20 hours post - infection with influenza a virus , consistent with a rna replication defect ( fig . 3i ) . 21 this defect in replication was completely rescued by supplementing purine analog inosine in the 22 media , supporting a conserved function of mthfd1 in viral infection in bats and humans ( fig .   23    3h and 3j , supplementary fig . 4 ) . 24 25 carolacton , a natural product derived from bacteria , has recently been identified as a potent 27 inhibitor of mthfd1 33 . we tested the effect of this compound on viral replication . carolacton 28 inhibited zika virus and mumps virus replication in paki cells in a dose dependent fashion ( fig .   29    4a , 4b and 4c ) . the inhibition was achieved at doses with little cytotoxicity ( fig . 4a ) . 30 mechanistically , this inhibition was completely rescued by supplementation of inosine , providing 31 8 support that carolacton indeed exerts antiviral activities by inhibiting mthfd1 ( fig . 4b and 4c ) . 1 vero e6 cells was effectively inhibited at sub - micromolar concentrations by carolacton ( ic 50 = 0.14 3 µm ) ( fig . 4d ) . the cytotoxic effect is very moderate in comparison ( fig . 4d ) , supporting a 4 therapeutic window of this compound in potential clinical applications . 5 6 discussion 7 we developed the first bat genome - wide rnai and crispr libraries and performed two screens 8 with two different rna viruses . although the screening methodologies are quite different , we 9 uncovered similar pathways essential for viral replication , namely the endocytosis pathway and 10 protein secretory pathways . the different genes in these two pathways identified from the screens 11 reflect the complementarity of the methodologies , with rnai screening useful for observing acute 12 effects on viral infection and crispr screening for long - term effects on cell survival . other than 13 technical differences between screening methods , viral kinetics , sensitivity of the viruses to loss-14 of - function of genes , differences in genome coverage within the two libraries likely contributed to 15 the different hits observed in our studies . both libraries provide valuable and complementary 16 sources that meet the urgent need to address the biological questions of bats . similar to human 17 genomic libraries , the utility of these bat libraries in screening different cell types of bats , 18 especially those of the immune systems , would unveil more secrets of this enigmatic species . 19 20 both screens identified mthfd1 as an essential viral host factor . mthfd1 is a key enzyme 21 in the c1 metabolism responsible for production of purine , dtmp and methyl group , the first two 22 of which are building blocks for dna and rna synthesis . interestingly , all previous rnai and 23 crispr screens using human cells have not identified mthfd1 as a host factor . moreover , we 24 found bats cells and tissues have lower mthfd1 expression levels than their human counterparts 25 ( supplementary fig . 5a , 5b and 5c ) . this might be related to the difference in the promoter 26 regions between bats and humans , notably a lack of ccaat box 34 in the promoter of two bat 27 species ( supplementary fig . 5d ) . we show that mthfd1 knockdown blocks replication of 28 multiple rna viruses , including influenza virus , mumps virus , melaka virus and zika virus . 29 importantly , host cells have a higher tolerance for mthfd1 inhibition than viruses , potentially 30 providing a therapeutic window for targeting mthfd1 with antiviral drugs . virus infection 31 9 converts the whole cellular machinery into a factory to massively produce progeny viruses , which 1 explains the vital dependence on mthfd1 . this is analogous to cancer cell 's addiction to non-2 oncogenic gene functions such as many metabolic enzymes 35 . similar to the therapeutic targeting 3 of these non - oncogenic addictions for developing cancer drugs , these viral addictions to metabolic 4 enzymes such as mthfd1 could open doors to many new opportunities for developing broad-5 spectrum antiviral drugs 36 . these drugs could be readily applied in emerging epidemics , as 6 demonstrated by our evidence here that mthfd1 inhibitor carolacton can suppress the infection 7 of sars - cov-2 . we envision the functional genomics tools we provided here will be instrumental 8 to further discoveries by better understanding the bat - virus interaction . 9 10 reference 11 1 leroy , e. m. et al . fruit bats as reservoirs of ebola virus .

69382cbac0bbdd2437414b92b122815b44d4cf46	capsule shows antiviral and anti - inflammatory abilities against novel coronavirus sars - cov-2 via suppression of nf - b signaling pathway , pharmacological research ( 2020 ) , ( zifeng yang ) . j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f graphical abstract j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f abstract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) has spread worldwide through person - to - person contact , causing a public health emergency of international concern . at present , there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for sars - cov-2 infection . liu shen capsule ( ls ) , a traditional chinese medicine , has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties , such as anti - inflammatory , antiviral and immunomodulatory activities . however , little is known about the antiviral effect of ls against sars - cov-2 . herein , the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of sars - cov-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host 's immune response . the inhibitory effect of ls against sars - cov-2 replication in vero e6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect ( cpe ) and plaque reduction assay . the number of virions of sars - cov-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with ls . proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon sars - cov-2 infection in huh-7 cells were measured by real - time quantitative pcr assays . the results showed that ls could significantly inhibit sars - cov-2 replication in vero e6 cells , and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro - inflammatory cytokines ( tnf - α , il-6 , il-1β , il-8 , ccl-2 / mcp-1 and cxcl-10 / ip-10 ) production at the mrna levels . moreover , the expression of the key proteins in the nf - κb / mapk signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that ls could inhibit the expression of p - nf - κb p65 , p - iκbα and p - p38 mapk , while increasing the expression of iκbα . these findings indicate that ls could inhibit sars - cov-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of nf - κb / mapk signaling pathway in vitro , making its promising candidate treatment for controlling covid-19 disease . 
697fe5f70633f7e752f04d10a84dd1a001947cf8	ethidium monoazide bromide ( ema ) treatment of pure culture and environmental waters at low concentrations ( 1.0 - 7.5 µg / ml ) indicated effective enumeration of viable and viable but nonculturable escherichia coli in pure cultures , creek waters , and secondary activated sludge effluent samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qpcr ) amplification of the uida and flic gene targets at turbidity values < 10 ntu . however , ema treatment was not effective in primary clarifier and secondary trickling filter effluents where turbidities were ≥10 ntu . in viable pure cultures , rapidly dividing and senescent cells were most affected by increasing ema concentrations . amplification of heat - killed pure bacterial cultures decreased 4 to 6 logs depending on ema concentration and culture age . the greatest difference was observed in 5-h cultures using 7.5 μg / ml ema . turbidity ( ≥100 ntu ) in environmental samples inhibited ema effectiveness on viability discrimination . enumeration of e. coli in certain wastewaters using ema - qpcr was similar to culture suggesting that ema treatment could be incorporated into qpcr assays for the quantification of viable bacteria increasing assay time no more than 30 min . our results indicate that ema can be used in routine qpcr assays , but optimum conditions for exposure must be identified for each sample type due to sample matrix effects such as turbidity . 
69e0c456d9b38f6894c1b0a3d52e7a9fd3154dae	a randomized , controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of early enteral nutrition ( en ) on intestinal permeability , intestinal protein loss , and outcome in parvoviral enteritis . dogs were randomized into 2 groups : 15 dogs received no food until vomiting had ceased for 12 hours ( mean 50 hours after admission ; npo group ) , and 15 dogs received early en by nasoesophageal tube from 12 hours after admission ( een group ) . all other treatments were identical . intestinal permeability was assessed by 6-hour urinary lactulose ( l ) and rhamnose ( r ) recoveries ( % l , % r ) and l / r recovery ratios . intestinal protein loss was quantified by fecal ␣ 1 -proteinase inhibitor concentrations ( ␣ 1 -pi ) . median time to normalization of demeanor , appetite , vomiting , and diarrhea was 1 day shorter for the een group for each variable . body weight increased insignificantly from admission in the npo group ( day 3 : 2.5 ϯ 2.8 % ; day 6 : 4.3 ϯ 2.3 % ; mean ϯ se ) , whereas the een group exhibited significant weight gain ( day 3 : 8.1 ϯ 2.7 % ; day 6 : 9.7 ϯ 2.1 % ) . mean urinary % l was increased , % r reduced , and l / r recovery ratios increased compared to reference values throughout the study for both groups . percent lactulose recovery decreased in the een group ( admission : 22.6 ϯ 8.0 % ; day 6 : 17.9 ϯ 2.3 % ) and increased in the npo group ( admission : 11.0 ϯ 2.6 % ; day 6 : 22.5 ϯ 4.6 % , p ϭ .035 ) . fecal ␣ 1 -pi was above reference values in both groups and declined progressively . no significant differences occurred for % r , l / r ratios , or ␣ 1 -pi between groups . thirteen npo dogs and all een dogs survived ( p ϭ .48 ) . the een group showed earlier clinical improvement and significant weight gain . the significantly decreased % l in the een versus npo group might reflect improved gut barrier function , which could limit bacterial or endotoxin translocation .

6a54b714b9b5bc344f320ed9a9957ee0d6aab87e	since the middle of december 2019 , a novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) outbroke , and rapidly spread throughout the world , early studies utilized realtime reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) to confirm that the samples collected from one patient with pneumonia were positive for panbetacoronavirus . ( 1 ) the viruses isolated from human cell lines were observed to contain typical crownlike shapes under a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) with negative staining . ( 1 ) based on metagenomic sequencing , the whole - genome sequence of the virus was determined . ( 1,2 ) bioinformatics analysis indicated that the novel virus causing severe pneumonia is a new type of betacoronavirus . the virus shares various typical genomic compositions with other betacoronavirus family members and has the highest sequence homology ( 96 % sequence similarity ) to severe acute respiratory syndrom ( sars)-like ratg13 in bats , ( 1 ) and the virus is named as sars - cov-2 . objective : to select potential molecules that can target viral spike proteins , which may potentially : to select potential molecules that can target viral spike proteins , which may potentially interrupt the interaction between the human angiotension - converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) receptor and viral spike protein interrupt the interaction between the human angiotension - converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) receptor and viral spike protein by virtual screening . by virtual screening . methods methods : the three - dimensional ( 3d)-coordinate fi le of the receptor - binding domain ( rbd)-ace2 : the three - dimensional ( 3d)-coordinate fi le of the receptor - binding domain ( rbd)-ace2 complex for searching a suitable docking pocket was firstly downloaded and prepared . secondly , approximately complex for searching a suitable docking pocket was firstly downloaded and prepared . secondly , approximately 15,000 molecular candidates were prepared , including us food and drug administration ( fda)-approved drugs 15,000 molecular candidates were prepared , including us food and drug administration ( fda)-approved drugs from drugbank and natural compounds from traditional chinese medicine systems pharmacology ( tcmsp ) , for the from drugbank and natural compounds from traditional chinese medicine systems pharmacology ( tcmsp ) , for the docking process . then , virtual screening was performed and the binding energy in autodock vina was calculated . docking process . then , virtual screening was performed and the binding energy in autodock vina was calculated . finally , the top 20 molecules with high binding energy and their chinese medicine ( cm ) herb sources were listed finally , the top 20 molecules with high binding energy and their chinese medicine ( cm ) herb sources were listed in this paper . in this paper . results results : it was found that digitoxin , a cardiac glycoside in drugbank and bisindigotin in tcmsp had : it was found that digitoxin , a cardiac glycoside in drugbank and bisindigotin in tcmsp had the highest docking scores . interestingly , two of the cm herbs containing the natural compounds that had relatively the highest docking scores . interestingly , two of the cm herbs containing the natural compounds that had relatively high binding scores , high binding scores , forsythiae fructus forsythiae fructus and and isatidis radix isatidis radix , are components of lianhua qingwen ( 莲花清瘟 ) , a cm , are components of lianhua qingwen ( 莲花清瘟 ) , a cm formula reportedly exerting activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars)-cov-2 . moreover , raltegravir , formula reportedly exerting activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars)-cov-2 . moreover , raltegravir , an hiv integrase inhibitor , was found to have a relatively high binding score . an hiv integrase inhibitor , was found to have a relatively high binding score . conclusions conclusions : a class of compounds , : a class of compounds , which are from fda - approved drugs and cm natural compounds , that had high binding energy with rbd of the viral which are from fda - approved drugs and cm natural compounds , that had high binding energy with rbd of the viral spike protein . our work provides potential candidates spike protein . our work provides potential candidates for other researchers to identify inhibitors to prevent for other researchers to identify inhibitors to prevent sars - cov-2 infection , and highlights the importance sars - cov-2 infection , and highlights the importance of cm and integrative application of cm and western of cm and integrative application of cm and western medicine on treating covid-19 . medicine on treating covid-19 .

6a6bd107c17007857d566a33523b29db491b919a	this research quantifies the various south african lockdown regimes , for the sars - cov-2 pandemic , in terms of the basic reproduction number , r 0 . it further calculates the levels of immunity required for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work , then predicts their perceived values , should infections have been underestimated by a factor of 10 . the first , level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious , sars - cov-2 virus , based on a limited knowledge . its basic reproduction number ( r 0 = 1.93 ) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity . obviously , it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent , lower levels of lockdown . the basic reproduction number for the level-3 lockdown was found to be 2.34 and that of the level-4 lockdown , 1.69 . the suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally ' smarter ' than the ' harder ' , level-5 lockdown , although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal , or the everpresent error associated with data sets , in general . the pandemic 's basic reproduction number was calculated to be 3.16 , in the swedish context . the lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed , bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data . the lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic . 
6b0567729c2143a66d737eb0a2f63f2dce2e5a7d	inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract are commonly associated with elevated production of nitric oxide ( no • ) and increased indices of no • -dependent oxidative stress . although no • is known to have anti - microbial , anti - inflammatory and anti - oxidant properties , various lines of evidence support the contribution of no • to lung injury in several disease models . on the basis of biochemical evidence , it is often presumed that such no •dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite , although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte - derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation . because of the overwhelming literature on no • generation and activities in the respiratory tract , it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively . instead , it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of no • to inflammatory diseases of the lung . ards = acute respiratory distress syndrome ; epo = eosinophil peroxidase ; mpo = myeloperoxidase ; no • = nitric oxide ; nos = no • synthase ; o 2 •-= superoxide ; onoo -= peroxynitrite ; rns = reactive nitrogen species .

722a9c0570574ff652c4cf4c7ba325e62608c594	due to the present covid-19 pandemic , forensic mental telehealth assessment ( fmta ) is an increasingly utilized means of conducting court - sanctioned psychiatric and psychological evaluations . fmta is not a novel development , and studies have been published during the past two decades that opine on the positive and negative implications of conducting testing and interview procedures online , in forensic and traditionally clinical matters alike . the present article examines the prospects for eventual legal challenges to fmta , describes considerations for conducting fmta in both institutional and residential settings , and concludes that fmta is now - due to predicted accommodations on the part of courts , attorneys , institutions , and professional guilds - a permanent part of the forensic evaluation landscape , even once the present covid-19 pandemic has subsided . 
724a7d177a40c86c6f77e8983c1a65e518d306de	the potential of dna microarrays for detection of plant viruses is hampered by underutilization of sequence - independent amplification methods for target nucleic acid enrichment . a microarray system is described for an unbiased detection of plant viruses using both short ( 30 nt ) and long ( 50 and 70 nt ) oligonucleotide probes . the assay involves amplification of target nucleic acid using random primers followed by in vitro transcription whose crna product is labeled chemically , fragmented and used as target for hybridization . initial optimization tests with turnip vein clearing virus and cauliflower mosaic virus showed increased hybridization efficiency with shorter cdna targets ( 100 bp ) and longer probes ( 50 and 70 nt ) . the system was validated in pure and mixed samples by detection of three tymovirus species : asclepias asymptomatic virus , kennedya yellow mosaic virus and turnip yellow mosaic virus . the method could detect sequence variants with 70 - 75 % or higher sequence identity , indicating the possible utility of the approach for virus discovery . array performance comparison of long probes demonstrated the competence of 50-mers to provide a satisfactory balance between detection sensitivity and specificity . the work described is a significant step towards a method to assess , in one assay , the presence of a large diversity of relatives of known viruses of plants . 
7274032555eb0d73921b324afa56ee4e9f8f459c	bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses , such as hendra virus , nipah virus , ebola virus , marburg virus , rabies and other lyssaviruses . recently , a large number of viruses closely related to members of the genus coronavirus have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and detected in bat species . in this study , samples were collected from 106 live bats of seven different bat species from 27 different locations in slovenia . coronaviruses were detected by rt - pcr in 14 out of 36 horseshoe bat ( rhinolophus hipposideros ) fecal samples , with 38.8 % virus prevalence . sequence analysis of a 405-nucleotide region of the highly conserved rna polymerase gene ( pol ) showed that all coronaviruses detected in this study are genetically closely related , with 99.5 - 100 % nucleotide identity , and belong to group 2 of the coronaviruses . the most closely related virus sequence in genbank was sars bat isolate rp3/2004 ( dq071615 ) within the sars - like cov cluster , sharing 85 % nucleotide identity and 95.6 % amino acid identity . the potential risk of a new group of bat coronaviruses as a reservoir for human infections is highly suspected , and further molecular epidemiologic studies of these bat coronaviruses are needed . 
7274f439641a1f4dc180a94cafe9b69d37e60415	we investigated whether small rna ( srna ) sequenced from field - collected mosquitoes and chironomids ( diptera ) can be used as a proxy signature of viral prevalence within a range of species and viral groups , using srnas sequenced from wild - caught specimens , to inform total rna deep sequencing of samples of particular interest . using this strategy , we sequenced from adult anopheles maculipennis s.l . mosquitoes the apparently nearly complete genome of one previously undescribed virus related to chronic bee paralysis virus , and , from a pool of ochlerotatus caspius and oc . detritus mosquitoes , a nearly complete entomobirnavirus genome . we also reconstructed long sequences ( 1503 - 6557 nt ) related to at least nine other viruses . crucially , several of the sequences detected were reconstructed from host organisms highly divergent from those in which related viruses have been previously isolated or discovered . it is clear that viral transmission and maintenance cycles in nature are likely to be significantly more complex and taxonomically diverse than previously expected .

73e3d6f3f33c747bffbbb8122ab855bfb59676db	objectives : we compared the expelled air dispersion distances during coughing from a human patient simulator ( hps ) lying at 45u with and without wearing a surgical mask or n95 mask in a negative pressure isolation room . methods : airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke . coughing bouts were generated by short bursts of oxygen flow at 650 , 320 , and 220l / min to simulate normal , mild and poor coughing efforts , respectively . the coughing jet was revealed by laser light - sheet and images were captured by high definition video . smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles . significant exposure was arbitrarily defined where there was $ 20 % of normalized smoke concentration . results : during normal cough , expelled air dispersion distances were 68 , 30 and 15 cm along the median sagittal plane when the hps wore no mask , a surgical mask and a n95 mask , respectively . in moderate lung injury , the corresponding air dispersion distances for mild coughing efforts were reduced to 55 , 27 and 14 cm , respectively , p , 0.001 . the distances were reduced to 30 , 24 and 12 cm , respectively during poor coughing effort as in severe lung injury . lateral dispersion distances during normal cough were 0 , 28 and 15 cm when the hps wore no mask , a surgical mask and a n95 mask , respectively . conclusions : normal cough produced a turbulent jet about 0.7 m towards the end of the bed from the recumbent subject . n95 mask was more effective than surgical mask in preventing expelled air leakage during coughing but there was still significant sideway leakage . 
73e97c80da805cb7452f25adb5f946559b5aed18	in the present study , we fabricated a label - free avian influenza ( aiv h5n1 ) detection biosensor composed of a multi - functional dna 3 way - junction ( 3 w j ) on a hollow au spike - like nanoparticle ( hausn ) using a localized surface plasmon resonance ( lspr ) method . to construct the multi - functional dna ( mf - dna ) as a bioprobe , the 3 w j was introduced . the proposed aiv detection bioprobe should contain three functionalities : target recognition , signal amplification , and connection to substrate . to achieve this goal , each piece of the dna 3 w j was tailored to a hemagglutinin ( ha ) binding aptamer , fam dye and thiol group , respectively . the assembly of each dna 3 w j functional fragment was then confirmed by tbm - native page . moreover , the hausn was immobilized on the indium - tin - oxide ( ito ) substrate for lspr measurement . the dna 3 w j was immobilized onto the hausn electrode through the thiol - group of dna 3 w j. the fabricated dna 3 w j / hausn heterolayer on the ito substrate was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy ( fe - sem ) and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) . lspr experiments were conducted to confirm ha protein binding to the dna 3 w j/ hausn -modified electrode . the proposed biosensor can detected the ha protein in pbs buffer ( lod : 1 pm ) as well as in the diluted chicken serum ( lod : 1 pm ) . the present study details a label - free , simple fabrication method consisted of dna 3 w j/ hausn heterolayer that uses easy - to - tailor elements to detect not only aiv but also various viruses detection platform easily . 
7506859560efebc4640e77683b549c2c5097acfd	traditional chinese exercise ( tce ) has gradually become one of the widespread complementary therapies for treatment and recovery of cancers . however , evidence based on the systematic evaluation of its efficacy is lacking , and there appears to be no conclusion regarding the setting of tce interventions . the purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the current randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) that outline the effects of tce on cancer patients . relevant studies were searched by google scholar , sciencedirect , and web of science using " traditional chinese exercise " and " cancer . " only rcts published in peer - reviewed english journals were included . a total of 27 studies covering 1616 cancer patients satisfied the eligibility criteria for this review . despite the methodological limitation and relatively high risk of bias possessed by some included studies , positive evidence was still detected on the effects of tce on these cancer - related health outcomes in physical , psychological , and physiological parameters . the 60-min or 90-min course of tce intervention for two to three times per week for 10 to 12 weeks was found to be the most common setting in these studies and has effectively benefited cancer patients . these findings add scientific support to encourage cancer patients to practice tce during or after conventional medical treatment . nevertheless , future well - designed rcts with improved methodology and larger sample size on this field are much warranted for further verification .

778a0fd080fb4b2e27dfc13099c7eeabbb565f40	hand hygiene is considered one of the most important infection control measures for preventing healthcare - associated infections . however , compliance rates with recommended hand hygiene practices in hospitals remain low . previous literature on ways to improve hand hygiene practices has focused on the usa and europe , whereas studies from developing countries are less common . in this study , we sought to identify common issues and potential strategies for improving hand hygiene practices in hospitals in china . we used a qualitative survey design based on in - depth interviews with 25 key hospital and public health staff in eight hospitals selected by the chinese ministry of health . we found that hospital workers viewed hand hygiene as paramount to effective infection control and had adequate knowledge about proper hand hygiene practices . despite these positive attitudes and adequate knowledge , critical challenges to improving rates of proper hand hygiene practices were identified . these included lack of needed resources , limited organisational authority of hospital infection control departments , and ineffective use of data monitoring and feedback to motivate improvements . our study suggests that a pivotal issue for improving hand hygiene practice in china is providing infection control departments adequate attention , priority , and influence within the hospital , with a clear line of authority to senior management . elevating the place of infection control on the hospital organisational chart and changing the paradigm of surveillance to continuous monitoring and effective data feedback are central to achieving improved hand hygiene practices and quality of care . 
77ba146a186708d66b9743b410d04cd14b003dbf	because many strains of mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) infect laboratory mice , no effective vaccine has yet been developed . an alternative approach to control mhv disease is the use of a host cell receptor - targeted ligand . to address the potential usefulness of this approach , a monoclonal antibody directed against the host cell receptor for the coronavirus mhv - a59 was administered to infant mice that were then challenged oronasally with 1()4 intracerebral infant mouse median lethal doses of mh\'-a59 . antibody treatment of virus - challenged mice resulted in lower proportions of mice with mhv - a59 in target organs and markedly reduced viral titers in these organs compared with mock - treated infected mice . some antibody - treated infected mice survived for 7 days after viral challenge , whereas no mock - treated , infected mice survived beyond day 3 after viral inoculation . these results support a receptor - targeted approach to intervention in coronavirus disease . a receptor - targeted approach appears most likely te be effective in viral diseases in which the virus enters the body and first replicates in epithelial cells , such as those of the respiratory or intestinal tracts , which may be most accessible to treatment with receptor - blocking substances . an excellent model for analysis of such a receptor - targeted approach to prevention of viral disease is the murine coronavirus , mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) . mhv is the most prevalent virus infecting laboratory mouse colonies worldwide [ 6 ] , and many mhv strains with tropisms for either respiratory or intestinal mucosal surfaces have been identified [ 7 ] . the receptor for the a59 strain of mhv ( mhv - a59 ) has been identified as a 110-to 120-kda glycoprotein [ 8 , 9 ] . virusoverlay protein blot assays ( vopba ) reveal that this glycoprotein is expressed on intestinal brush border membranes and hepatocyte membranes of mhv - susceptible balb / c mice 
77c5f0ef0ebfca93b618c8522b31d739203ca6ed	we read with great interest the article on adapting childhood cancer services during the covid-19 pandemic from global pediatric oncology experts . 1,2 the document highlights the six most curable cancers with practical advice for their management during the covid-19 pandemic , and includes adaptations for low - to middle - income countries ( lmics ) . while we share the broad consensus outlined here , we faced several unique challenges at our hospital - a large tertiary cancer care center in mumbai , now at the epicenter of the outbreak in india - compelling us to take several steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic , which may be of benefit to others affected similarly in healthcare settings closer to ours . the government of india declared one of the largest and most complete lockdowns in the world on march 25 , 2020 , which may have had an impact on slowing the first surge of covid-19 . well before this , our center anticipated a potential cancer - care disaster , located as we are in a population - dense urban setting with overstretched infrastructure and an unparalleled workload of over 60 000 new cases of cancer annually , including nearly 3000 children , more than 95 % being from outside mumbai . measures were initiated 2 weeks prior to the lockdown aimed at reducing outpatient footfall and conservation of supportive care resources and staff , as already detailed elsewhere . 3 , 4 within this larger response , we tailored management of pediatric cancers to meet the twin objectives of retaining hard - fought recent improvements in disease outcomes of largely curable malignancies , 5,6 while balancing resource constraints from disruption of services , and evolving strategies for the inevitable cancer with covid-19 patient surge . our priority was to immediately reduce the average of 300 daily outpatient visits to pediatric cancer units by more than 50 % . screening at entrance gates was done by medical teams that dispensed advice and medication for low - risk patients such as those on follow up or maintenance therapies without the patient needing to enter the premises , and they were later followed up telephonically . a comprehensive teleconsult facility was set up to prevent unwarranted visits by those due to follow up in the coming weeks from around the country . we achieved the targeted 50 % reduction before the lockdown , which in turn led to travel disruptions preventing new cases reaching us . despite these measures , 890 active cases were seen in the pediatric outpatient clinics with over 2900 clinic visits from march 21 to may 1 , 2020 , including 15 new cases . to reduce the strain on supportive care resources such as disruptions in blood product supplies , we were able to fall back on several measures that had been successfully used earlier . these included low - cost adaption of protocols that substituted high - dose methotrexate , and oral metronomic chemotherapy ( omct ) used in curative settings such as maintenance , or as a bridge to definitive therapy , by giving time to ameliorate severe comorbidities or socioeconomic constraints with necessary interventions prior to the standard treatment . these strategies have consistently yielded us acceptable and often excellent outcomes . 5 - 8 we rolled out a comprehensive set of measures including these and similar adaptations , and summarized them for easy reference . 9 these guidelines helped us to successfully brace for the initial covid-19 surge , and a brief summary of the first seven cases of childhood cancer from among 59 covid-19 patients in 5 weeks from the first recorded case seen at our center is included ( table 1 ) . with recent publicly available data showing no signs of the first wave abating in mumbai and other parts of india , we have updated our guidelines to adapt to the rapidly changing external and internal logistics and pandemic realities .

77eb2dc4442518f5757a339ddea166750afeafd1	the network theory of autoimmunity is presented with recent experimental data relevant to the understanding of the pathogenesis of aids . schematically , effector t cells specific for self - antigens exist normally , but their activity is modulated and prevented by networks of regulatory t cells . as a result of mimicry between molecular components of microorganisms and self - antigens , autoimmune disease can be triggered by specific foreign pathogens which alter the state of activity of the network from suppression to activation . conversely , by a procedure known as t - cell vaccination , autologous effector t cells re - injected after in vitro stimulation and attenuation may alter the state of the network from an activation to a suppression . numerous observations are reviewed that support the concept of autoimmune activity in the destruction of non - infected t4 cells . such activity is presumed to be triggered by an antigen of viral origin , the most likely , but not the only one , being the envelope protein gpl20 . based on this hypothesis , a t - cell vaccination procedure against effector t cells responsible for autoimmunopathic activity in hiv - seropositive patients is proposed , similar to the one known from experimental study of autoimmunity and presently being tested in human autoimmune diseases . its purpose would be to prevent t - cell loss and the onset of immunodeficiency disease in hiv - seropositive patients . apart from its potential therapeutic value , this procedure will have use as a therapeutic test from which insight will be gained about the immunopathogenesis of aids .

7a42dabec620c6d9bf9133f5c40700a103d78146	although membrane fusion occurs ubiquitously and continuously in all eukaroytic cells , little is known about the mechanism that governs lipid bilayer fusion associated with any intracellular fusion reactions . recent studies of the fusion of enveloped viruses with host cell membranes have helped to define the fusion process . the identification and characterization of key proteins involved in fusion reactions have mainly driven recent advances in our understanding of membrane fusion . the most important denominator among the fusion proteins is the fusion peptide . in this review , work done in the last few years on the molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion will be highlighted , focusing in particular on the role of the fusion peptide and the modification of the lipid bilayer structure . much of what is known regarding the molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion has been gained using liposomes as model systems in which the molecular components of the membrane and the environment are strictly controlled . many amphilphilic peptides have a high affinity for lipid bilayers , but only a few sequences are able to induce membrane fusion . the presence of α - helical structure in at least part of the fusion peptide is strongly correlated with activity whereas , β - structure tends to be less prevalent , associated with non - native experimental conditions , and more related to vesicle aggregation than fusion . the specific angle of insertion of the peptides into the membrane plane is also found to be an important characteristic for the fusion process . a shallow penetration , extending only to the central aliphatic core region , is likely responsible for the destabilization of the lipids required for coalescence of the apposing membranes and fusion .

8586ac6debb079c48da68c3073203a22e0de67a0	decades of research on differences in the language of men and women have established postulates about preferences in lexical , topical , and emotional expression between the two genders , along with their sociological underpinnings . using a novel dataset of male and female linguistic productions collected from the reddit discussion platform , we further confirm existing assumptions about gender - linked affective distinctions , and demonstrate that these distinctions are amplified in social media postings involving emotionally - charged discourse related to covid-19 . our analysis also confirms considerable differences in topical preferences between male and female authors in spontaneous pandemic - related discussions . 
85b5447948b449ab1c2e90e5a165e62c5df853bc	since the re - emergence of ebola in west africa in 2014 , comprehensive and stringent interventions have been implemented to decelerate the spread of the disease . the effectiveness of interventions still remains unclear . in this paper , we develop an epidemiological model that includes various controlling measures to systematically evaluate their effects on the disease transmission dynamics . by fitting the model to reported cumulative cases and deaths in guinea , sierra leone and liberia until march 22 , 2015 , we estimate the basic reproduction number in these countries as 1.2552 , 1.6093 and 1.7994 , respectively . model analysis shows that there exists a threshold of the effectiveness of isolation , below which increasing the fraction of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset or shortening the duration between symptoms onset and isolation may lead to more ebola infection . this challenges an existing view . media coverage plays a substantial role in reducing the final epidemic size . the response to reported cumulative infected cases and deaths may have a different effect on the epidemic spread in different countries . among all the interventions , we find that shortening the duration between death and burial and improving the effectiveness of isolation are two effective interventions for controlling the outbreak of ebola virus infection . 
8625500798fdc7f5c3e4793bd215f1ba2660cfda	the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in school closures and distancing requirements that have disrupted both work and family life for many . concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally . many medical journals have published papers on the pandemic , which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of these disruptions . here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019 , for papers with first authors and last authors from the united states . using mixedeffects regression models , we estimated that the proportion of covid-19 papers with a woman first author was 19 % lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019 , while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive . a closer examination suggested that women 's representation as first authors of covid-19 research was particularly low for papers published in march and april 2020 . our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women , especially early - career women , has been affected more than the research productivity of men .

86fc089cac3a5df23b1c0023cc9f964442e7919c	we investigate the transition probabilities for the " flavor " eigenstates in the twolevel quantum system , which is described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian with the parity and time - reversal ( pt ) symmetry . particularly , we concentrate on the so - called pt - broken phase , where two eigenvalues of the non - hermitian hamiltonian turn out to be a complex conjugate pair . in this case , we find that the transition probabilities will be unbounded in the limit of infinite time t → + ∞. after making a connection between the pt - broken phase and the neutral - meson system in particle physics , we observe that the infinite - time behavior of the transition probabilities can be attributed to the negative decay width of one eigenstate of the non - hermitian hamiltonian . we also present some brief remarks on the situation at the so - called exceptional point , where both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian non - hermitian hamiltonians with the joint parity and time - reversal ( pt ) symmetry have recently attracted a lot of attention [ 1 ] and very interesting applications have been found for a number of physical systems in particle physics , nuclear physics , optics , electronics , and many others [ 2 ] . in the existing literature , the two - level system with pt - symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonians [ 3 , 4 ] has been extensively investigated , as a simple but instructive example , to explore and clarify all related conceptual issues [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . however , it is worthwhile to mention that the transition amplitudes and probabilities between the " flavor " eigenstates have rarely been studied , except for some general discussion in refs . [ 8 , 9 ] . since the phenomenon of " flavor " mixing is quite common in particle physics , such as flavor oscillations of massive neutrinos [ 10 ] and the neutral - meson system p 0 -p 0 [ 11 ] ( e.g. , , it is intriguing to consider the transitions among " flavor " eigenstates in the system with pt - symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonians [ 12 , 13 ] . in our previous work [ 13 ] , we calculated the transition probabilities for the " flavor " eigenstates in the scenario , where the pt symmetry is always preserved and two eigenvalues of the non - hermitian hamiltonian are real , which is known as the pt - symmetric phase . in the present work , we aim to extend the previous study in the pt - symmetric phase to the pt - broken phase . the primary motivation for such an extension is at least two - fold . first , by " flavor " eigenstates of a two - level quantum system with a non - hermitian hamiltonian h , we mean the complete set of basis vectors { |u β } ( for β = a , b ) , in which the matrix representation of the hamiltonian is given by h αβ ≡ u α |h|u β and the left vectors u α | ≡ |u α † and u β | ≡ |u β † ( for α , β = a , b ) have been defined as in conventional quantum mechanics . therefore , the transition amplitudes in the following discussion will be referred to the projection of the time - evolved flavor eigenstates { |u α ( t ) } into their initial states { |u β } . however , whenever the transition amplitudes a αβ ≡ u β |u α ( t ) are calculated , we will clearly indicate the exact definition of the involved inner product as well as that of the left state vectors . as mentioned , for pt - symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonians , the transition amplitudes a αβ and the corresponding probabilities p αβ ≡ |a αβ | 2 have been explicitly computed and extensively studied in ref . [ 13 ] . hence , it is a natural continuation to extend the investigation to the pt - broken phase . second , in contrast to the pt - symmetric phase , where two eigenvalues of the non - hermitian hamiltonian are real , the pt - broken phase will be complicated by a complexconjugate pair of eigenvalues . as is well known , if pt symmetry is maintained , it is always possible to find a similarity transformation that converts a non - hermitian hamiltonian into its hermitian counterpart [ 5 , 7 , 13 ] . however , this is impossible for the pt - broken phase , rendering it rather different . hence , in this particular case , the transition probabilities deserve a dedicated study . the remaining part of this work is organized as follows . in sec . 2 , we present the general formalism for the investigation of pt - symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonians and summarize the main features of the pt - symmetric phase , the pt - broken phase , and the

878d2ac6c02578eb7166149d9f6a2b4e01a238b6	in the present study , we evaluated post - mortem lateral cerebral ventricle ( lcv ) changes using computed tomography ( ct ) . subsequent periodical ct scans termed bsequential scans^were obtained for three cadavers . the first scan was performed immediately after the body was transferred from the emergency room to the institute of legal medicine . sequential scans were obtained and evaluated for 24 h at maximum . the time of death had been determined in the emergency room . the sequential scans enabled us to observe periodical post - mortem changes in ct images . the series of continuous lcv images obtained up to 24 h ( two cases)/16 h ( 1 case ) after death was evaluated . the average hounsfield units ( hu ) within the lcvs progressively increased , and lcv volume progressively decreased over time . the hu in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) increased at an individual rate proportional to the post - mortem interval ( pmi ) . thus , an early longitudinal radiodensity change in the csf could be potential indicator of post - mortem interval ( pmi ) . sequential imaging scans reveal post - mortem changes in the csf space which may reflect post - mortem brain alterations . further studies are needed to evaluate the proposed csf change markers in correlation with other validated pmi indicators . 
87fb87a95a08bdd98ee2681665d0f09687924af8	introduction it has been recognized that significant transporter interactions result in volume of distribution changes in addition to potential changes in clearance . for drugs that are not clinically significant transporter substrates , it is expected that drug - drug interactions would not result in any changes in volume of distribution . methods an evaluation of this hypothesis proceeded via an extensive analysis of published intravenous metabolic drug - drug interactions , based on clinically recommended index substrates and inhibitors of major cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) isoforms . results seventy - two metabolic drug interaction studies were identified where volume of distribution at steady - state ( v ss ) values were available for the cyp index substrates caffeine ( cyp1a2 ) , metoprolol ( cyp2d6 ) , midazolam ( cyp3a4 ) , theophylline ( cyp1a2 ) , and tolbutamide ( cyp2c9 ) . changes in exposure ( area under the curve ) up to 5.1-fold were observed ; however , ratios of v ss changes have a range of 0.70 - 1.26 , with one outlier displaying a v ss ratio of 0.57 . discussion these results support the widely held founding tenant of pharmacokinetics that clearance and v ss are independent parameters . knowledge that v ss is unchanged in metabolic drug - drug interactions can be helpful in discriminating changes in clearance from changes in bioavailability ( f ) when only oral dosing data are available , as we have recently demonstrated . as v ss remains unchanged for intravenous metabolic drug - drug interactions , following oral dosing changes in v ss /f will reflect changes in f alone . this estimation of f change can subsequently be utilized to assess changes in clearance alone from calculations of apparent clearance . utilization of this simple methodology for orally dosed drugs will have a significant impact on how drug - drug interactions are interpreted from drug development and regulatory perspectives . 
8806d2b5dd6c0709ed0fc8e99153cbef69fd4614	background : bovine respiratory syncytial virus ( brsv ) is one of the major pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease ( brd ) complex . the seroprevalence to brsv in norwegian cattle herds is high , but its role in epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear . the aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of brsv and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of brd and to perform phylogenetic analysis of norwegian brsv strains . results : brsv infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 ( 86 % ) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent . when serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were present , the number of brsv positive animals in the herd was always higher , supporting the view of brsv as the main pathogen . sequencing of the g gene of brsv positive samples showed that the current circulating norwegian brsvs belong to genetic subgroup ii , along with other north european isolates . one isolate from an outbreak in norway in 1976 was also investigated . this strain formed a separate branch in subgroup ii , clearly different from the current scandinavian sequences . the currently circulating brsv could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time . the sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the g protein . the results demonstrated that brsv is the most important etiological agent of epidemics of brd in norway and that it often acts as the only viral agent . the phylogenetic analysis of the norwegian strains of brsv and several previously published isolates supported the theory of geographical and temporal clustering of brsv .

882567b9731ea3104816803158c4fd2c94152532	the current consensus view is that a higher hierarchical taxonomy of viruses can not be established for two reasons . firstly , viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin , with several sets of viruses arising by different , independent routes at different times . secondly , subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host / vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution , with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material . thus , depending on the gene product used for comparison , different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced . further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes , gene duplication , deletions , frameshift mutations , point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing , unused reading frames .

8b478ceff05d4c8dcc2481121eaace20a1b674cd	china has led a rapid global spread around the world . for controlling covid-19 outbreaks , many countries have implemented two non - pharmaceutical interventions : suppression like immediate lockdowns in cities at epicentre of outbreak ; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand . both interventions have apparent pros and cons ; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited . we aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections , growth of deaths , peaks and lengths of covid-19 breakouts by taking multiple pharmaceutical interventions in london and the uk , accounting for reduction of healthcare demand . impacted on the number and distribution of infections , growth of deaths over time during january 2020 , and april 2020 . we combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of covid-19 in london , the uk ( non - london ) and the uk during february 2020 and march 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections , growth of deaths , and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions . findings we estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15 , one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in london from 23 rd march for 100 days , and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non - london regions . in this scenario , the total infections and deaths in the uk were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand ; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65 th day ( april 11 th ) , where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases . if we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the uk , the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand ; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65 th day , where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand . but if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the uk , the covid-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi - modal mode , where the total infections and deaths in the uk possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand . interpretation : our results show that taking rolling intervention is probably an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control covid-19 outbreaks in the uk . as large difference of population density and social distancing between london and non - london regions in the uk , it is more appropriate to implement consistent suppression in london for 100 days and rolling intervention in other regions . this strategy would potentially reduce the overall infections and deaths , and delay and reduce peak healthcare demand . all rights reserved . no reuse allowed without permission . author / funder , who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

8dc3e3104105b1c360fdfe01de88e4f35d6977d0	the silkworm baculovirus expression system is widely used to produce recombinant proteins . several strategies for constructing recombinant viruses that contain foreign genes have been reported . here , we developed a novel defective - rescue bmnpv bacmid ( rebmbac ) expression system . a copycontrol origin of replication was introduced into the viral genome to facilitate its genetic manipulation in escherichia coli and to ensure the preparation of large amounts of high quality rebmbac dna as well as high quality recombinant baculoviruses . the orf1629 , cathepsin and chitinase genes were partially deleted or rendered defective to improve the efficiency of recombinant baculovirus generation and the expression of foreign genes . the system was validated by the successful expression of luciferase reporter gene and porcine interferon γ . this system can be used to produce batches of recombinant baculoviruses and target proteins rapidly and efficiently in silkworms . 
8e0a624018b11784d1935de7589a21a5196850e9	while the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood , little is known about the postfusion events that precede rna replication , such as nucleocapsid disassembly . we describe here a sensitive , conditionally replicationdefective yellow fever virus ( yfv ) entry reporter , yfvδsk / nluc , to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming , virus particle - delivered genomes . we validated that yfvδsk / nluc gene expression can be neutralized by yfv - specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways and cellular factors , including clathrin - and dynamin - mediated endocytosis , endosomal acidification , yfv e glycoprotein - mediated fusion , and cellular ly6e and rplp1 expression . the initial round of yfv translation was shown to require cellular ubiquitylation , consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur . importantly , translation of incoming yfv genomes also required valosin - containing protein ( vcp)/p97 , a cellular atpase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large complexes . rna transfection and washout experiments showed that vcp / p97 functions at a postfusion , pretranslation step in yfv entry . finally , vcp / p97 activity was required by other flaviviruses in mammalian cells and by yfv in mosquito cells . together , these data support a critical role for vcp / p97 in the disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a postfusion step in virus entry . importance flaviviruses are an important group of rna viruses that cause significant human disease . the mechanisms by which flavivirus nucleocapsids are disassembled during virus entry remain unclear . here , we used a yellow fever virus entry reporter , which expresses a sensitive reporter enzyme but does not replicate , to show that nucleocapsid disassembly requires the cellular protein - disaggregating enzyme valosin - containing protein , also known as p97 . 
8e19c1769d110698e23853473fb8a61bd68e59c9	this review was aimed to systematically evaluate the available literature on the impact of covid-19 on cancer care and to critically analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies suggested by various healthcare providers , societies , and institutions . majority guidelines for various types of cancers favored a delay in treatment or a nonsurgical approach wherever feasible . these guidelines are based on a low level of evidence and have significant discordance for the role and timing of surgery , especially in early tumors . 
8e7d221febb0647763c74b251362f013b622dedf	the primary intracellular protein degradation systems , including the ubiquitin - proteasome and the lysosome pathways , have been emerging as central regulators of viral infectivity , inflammation , and viral pathogenicity . viral myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium caused by virus infection in the heart . the disease progression of viral myocarditis occurs in three distinct stages : acute viral infection , immune cell infiltration , and cardiac remodelling . growing evidence suggests a crucial role for host proteolytic machineries in the regulation of the pathogenesis and progression of viral myocarditis in all three stages . cardiotropic viruses evolve different strategies to subvert host protein degradation systems to achieve successful viral replication . in addition , these proteolytic systems play important roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infection . recent evidence also suggests a key role for the ubiquitin - proteasome and lysosome systems as the primary effectors of protein quality control in the regulation of cardiac remodelling . this review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the direct interaction between cardiotropic viruses and host proteolytic systems , with an emphasis on coxsackievirus b3 , one of the primary aetiological agents causing viral myocarditis , and highlights possible roles of the host degradation systems in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and its progression to dilated cardiomyopathy . --- 
8eb4f69bf719bb209575132a945a6899ebaa0fd1	outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo - hsct ) for patients with adult t cell leukemia/ lymphoma ( atl ) are not satisfactory , particularly in patients in non - complete remission at transplantation ( pt - non - cr ) . we conducted a regional retrospective study in the atl endemic area of okinawa , japan . of 62 atl patients , 21 received allo - hsct in cr and 41 in non - cr . the 3-year overall survival ( 3yos ) rate and median survival time for the whole cohort was 25.6 % and 7.7 months , respectively . the 3yos of pt - non - cr was significantly lower than that of patients in cr ( pt - cr ) ( 16.8 % vs. 43.6 % , p = 0.005 ) . transplant - related mortality ( trm ) was significantly higher in pt - non - cr than in pt - cr ( 46.3 % vs. 15.7 % , p = 0.025 ) , while there was no significant difference in disease - associated mortality ( dam ) between ptnon - cr and pt - cr . multivariable analysis for pt - non - cr revealed that poor performance status ( poor - ps ) and higher sil-2r level ( high sil-2r ) adversely affected os . poor - ps was associated with higher trm , but not with higher dam in pt - non - cr . high sil-2r did not affect trm or dam in pt - non - cr . overall , high trm rates rather than dam contribute to the poor outcomes of pt - non - cr , suggesting that not only disease control but also management of transplant - related complications is required for allo - hsct in atl patients . 
8ee3cbd80d164095b47332449f87b151a8bb33c2	objectives : the coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) is a novel infection caused by the coronavirus , which rapidly became a global pandemic . as disease outbreaks can adversely affect mental health , in this study , we explored the perceived stress levels among students during the covid-19 outbreak that led to the adjournment of faceto - face teaching in ksa . methods : we conducted a cross - sectional survey of 367 students from ksa , which assessed their sociodemographic characteristics , perceived stress scale , emotions q5 , and concerns during the covid-19 outbreak . results : most q6 participants were female ( 74.7 % ) and secondary school ( 79.8 % ) students . more than half of the participants showed moderate levels of stress ( 55 % ) , while 30.2 % registered high levels . females and university students showed a significant association with stress level ( p - value ¼ 0.003 and 0.049 , respectively ) . conclusions : there was a moderate to high level of stress among students in ksa at the start of the covid-19 outbreak . this study found a significant correlation between a high level of stress and female university students . the integration of online counselling q8 and stress management programs would help mitigate the stress of students during distance learning .

91b8cb1041fbbcc5774eb5d1634da179e3a78b61	the sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in 2002 prompted the establishment of a global scientific network subsuming most of the traditional rivalries in the competitive field of virology . within months of the sars outbreak , collaborative work revealed the identity of the disastrous pathogen as sars - associated coronavirus ( sars - cov ) . however , although the rapid identification of the agent represented an important breakthrough , our understanding of the deadly virus remains limited . detailed biological knowledge is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures , diagnostic tests , vaccines and antiviral drugs against the sars - cov. this article reviews the present state of molecular knowledge about sars - cov , from the aspects of comparative genomics , molecular biology of viral genes , evolution , and epidemiology , and describes the diagnostic tests and the anti - viral drugs derived so far based on the available molecular information .

95dbed40b9b6adbc57dcbae88e5bb4b8a3ad4929	using a viral model of the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , we show that intraspinal transplantation of human embryonic stem cell - derived neural precursor cells ( hnpcs ) results in sustained clinical recovery , although hnpcs were not detectable beyond day 8 posttransplantation . improved motor skills were associated with a reduction in neuroinflammation , decreased demyelination , and enhanced remyelination . evidence indicates that the reduced neuroinflammation is correlated with an increased number of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + regulatory t cells ( tregs ) within the spinal cords . coculture of hnpcs with activated t cells resulted in reduced t cell proliferation and increased treg numbers . the hnpcs acted , in part , through secretion of tgf - b1 and tgf - b2 . these findings indicate that the transient presence of hnpcs transplanted in an animal model of ms has powerful immunomodulatory effects and mediates recovery . further investigation of the restorative effects of hnpc transplantation may aid in the development of clinically relevant ms treatments . 
96463d3d90503bf7cd329355bd942087c52e3de3	dedicated to professor koji nakanishi on the occasion of his 80th birthday and to honor him for receiving the 2004 tetrahedron prize . abstract - the proteolytic processing of polyproteins by the 3cl protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is essential for the viral propagation . a series of tripeptide a , b - unsaturated esters and ketomethylene isosteres , including ag7088 , are synthesized and assayed to target the 3cl protease . though ag7088 is inactive ( ic 50 > 100 lm ) , the ketomethylene isosteres and tripeptide a , b - unsaturated esters containing both p1 and p2 phenylalanine residues show modest inhibitory activity ( ic 50 = 11 - 39 lm ) . the phe - phe dipeptide inhibitors 18a - e are designed on the basis of computer modeling of the enzyme - inhibitor complex . the most potent inhibitor 18c with an inhibition constant of 0.52 lm is obtained by condensation of the phe - phe dipeptide a , bunsaturated ester with 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamic acid . the cell - based assays also indicate that 18c is a nontoxic anti - sars agent with an ec 50 value of 0.18 lm. 
96e9bf5d58a1ba692047da7ffc07a3e1fb86c4da	a recombinant sars - cov spike ( s ) glycoprotein vaccine produced in insect cells in a pre - clinical development stage is described . a truncated version of s glycoprotein , containing only the ecto - domain , as well as a his - tagged full - length version were cloned and expressed in a serum - free insect cell line , expressf+ ® . the proteins , purified to apparent homogeneity by liquid column chromatography , were formulated without adjuvant at 3 , 9 , 27 , and 50 g per dose in phosphate saline and used to immunize mice . both antigens in each formulation elicited a strong immune response after two or three vaccinations with the antigen . neutralizing antibody titers correlated closely with standard elisa reactivity against the s glycoprotein . the truncated s protein was also formulated with an adjuvant , aluminum hydroxide , at 1 g per dose ( ±adjuvant ) , and 5 g per dose ( ±adjuvant ) . significantly enhanced immune responses , manifested by higher titers of serum elisa and viral neutralizing antibodies , were achieved in adjuvanted groups with fewer doses and lower concentration of s glycoprotein . these findings indicate that the ecto - domain of sars - cov s glycoprotein vaccine , with or without adjuvant , is immunogenic and induces high titers of virus neutralizing antibodies to levels similar to those achieved with the full s glycoprotein vaccine . the development of sars - cov vaccines has become a priority for preparedness for future outbreaks to protect health care workers managing new cases as well as the general population . a phase i clinical trial using killed - whole sars - cov vaccine has been conducted by sinovac biotech ltd. however , concerns have been raised for the use of inactivated virus vaccines based on observations with feline coronavirus . there are also several subunit vaccines in pre - clinical development , targeting sars - cov structural proteins , including the spike ( s ) and nucleocapsid ( n ) proteins . other vaccine candidates include vector - based dna vaccines [ 7 - 11 ] , a combination of whole killed virus and dna vaccines [ 12 ] , inactivated whole virus vaccines [ 13 , 14 ] , a combination of dna and s - peptide vaccines [ 15 ] , and other recombinant proteins and their fragments . 0264 - 410x/$ -see front matter 
972701bc4b66493f6bed639cc4f4c3f2b09467fd	in a field trial on a farm in turkey , we tested whether specific egg - yolk antibodies had a prophylactic effect on neonatal diarrhea . owing to its antibody spectrum , this egg powder was very suitable for this farm since mainly rotavirus was identified . regardless of the dosage ( 2 g , 4 g , or 8 g egg powder ) , the calves ( n = 164 ) which received specific egg - yolk antibodies via the whole egg during the first 14 days of life showed significant improvements in risk and duration of diarrhea and in body weight gain compared with calves of the control group ( n = 80 ) which had not received any egg powder . these significant differences in body weight still persisted after 3 months of life . the mortality risk in the control group amounted to 8.8 % , while in all egg powder groups ( n = 164 ) only one calf died as a result of diarrhea . breed - dependent differences in the parameters were not observed .

9ef0f6ed68926afd1ae205195b51205a24266bb5	acute aortic syndromes ( aass ) are difficult to diagnose emergencies . plasma soluble st2 ( sst2 ) , a prognostic biomarker for heart failure , has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker of aass outperforming d - dimer , the current diagnostic standard . we performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of sst2 for aass in the emergency department ( ed ) . in 2017 - 2018 , patients were enrolled if they had ≥1 red - flag symptoms ( chest / abdominal / back pain , syncope , perfusion deficit ) and a clinical suspicion of aas . sst2 was detected with the presage ® assay . adjudication was based on computed tomography angiography ( cta ) or on diagnostic outcome inclusive of 30-day follow - up . 297 patients were enrolled , including 88 with aass . the median age was 67 years . in 162 patients with cta , the median sst2 level was 41.7 ng / ml ( iqr 29.4 - 103.2 ) in aass and 34.6 ng / ml ( iqr 21.4 - 51.5 ) in alternative diagnoses ( p = 0.005 ) . in roc analysis , the auc of sst2 was 0.63 , as compared to 0.82 of d - dimer ( p < 0.001 ) . sensitivity and specificity values of sst2 associated with different cutoffs were : 95.5 % and 10.8 % ( ≥12 ng / ml ) , 84.1 % and 29.7 % ( ≥23.7 ng / ml ) , 35.2 % and 85.1 % ( ≥66.5 ng / ml ) . results were similar in the full cohort . in conclusion , in patients from a european ed , plasma sst2 provided modest accuracy for diagnosis of aass . acute aortic syndromes ( aass ) , which include acute aortic dissection ( aad ) , intramural aortic hematoma ( imh ) , penetrating aortic ulcer ( pau ) and spontaneous aortic rupture ( sar ) , are severe cardiovascular emergencies affecting 5 - 10 per 100.000 individuals a year 1 . a conclusive diagnosis of aass requires advanced aortic imaging , typically computed tomography angiography ( cta ) , which uses ionizing radiations and may cause contrast - induced nephropathy and anaphylaxis . however , selection of the right patient to image with cta is cumbersome , because aass present with unspecific symptoms such as truncal pain , syncope , neurological deficits and hindlimb ischemia . these are leading causes of emergency department ( ed ) visits worldwide , and most patients with these symptoms are affected by more common conditions , such as acute coronary syndromes , gastrointestinal diseases and muscle - skeletal pain . hence , the misdiagnosis rate of aass is high , affecting clinical outcomes 2 - 4 . increasing use of cta in eds has led to a high number of cta exams requested for suspected aas turning out negative , but has not substantially changed misdiagnosis rates , indicating that pre - test patient selection remains a key node 5 - 7 . development of reliable diagnostic biomarkers discriminating aass could positively impact on their diagnostic workup , as for other cardiovascular emergencies such as acute coronary syndromes and pulmonary embolism 8 , 9 . so far , potential biomarkers of aass have been searched for within aortic layers ( e.g. smooth muscle myosin , soluble elastin fragments , calponin , cd40 ligand ) , within inflammation / remodeling pathways ( e.g. matrix metalloproteinases ) and within coagulation processes mobilized by blood exposure to non - endothelial surfaces ( e.g. platelets , d - dimer ) 10 . currently , d - dimer is the only biomarker clinically applicable to the workup of aass 11,12 . owing to high sensitivity , d - dimer can be used for diagnostic rule - out of aass , if the pre - test probability is sufficiently low 13 . however , d - dimer can be increased by several conditions such as inflammation , infection , cancer , trauma and age , leading to low diagnostic specificity . on these grounds , the quest for additional diagnostic biomarkers for aass remains open and vibrant . st2 ( suppression of tumorigenicity 2 , encoded by interleukin 1 receptor - like 1 or il1rl-1 ) is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family , regulating immune - responses 14 . soluble st2 ( sst2 ) , a truncated form

[ 3 ] in 2013 , epstein evaluated 183 patients who were told by their first - opinion spine surgeons that they needed spine surgery . [ 2 ] in her opinion , 60.7 % required no surgery , 33.3 % were about to undergo the wrong or exceedingly extensive operations , while only 6 % were offered the " right " operation . in a 2014 article entitled " necessary or unnecessary ? a critical glance on spine surgery " , raabe et al . noted : " patients with complaints and symptoms caused by spinal degenerative diseases demonstrate a high rate of spontaneous improvement . " [ 5 ] we can debate the degree to which unnecessary surgery occurs , but the fact remains , it does exist . patients are increasingly being offered too extensive or insufficiently extensive minimally invasive spine operations that increase perioperative risks .

aae7699e079d2964df8078931cd0f94d4b1423d9	background : cytotoxic t cell ( ctl ) cross - reactivity is believed to play a pivotal role in generating immune responses but the extent and mechanisms of ctl cross - reactivity remain largely unknown . several studies suggest that ctl clones can recognize highly diverse peptides , some sharing no obvious sequence identity . the emerging realization in the field is that t cell receptors ( tcr ) recognize multiple distinct ligands . principal findings : first , we analyzed peptide scans of the hiv epitope slfntvatl ( sfl9 ) and found that tcr specificity is position dependent and that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition . inspired by this , we developed a general model of tcr peptide recognition using amino acid similarity matrices and found that such a model was able to predict the cross - reactivity of a diverse set of ctl epitopes . with this model , we were able to demonstrate that seemingly distinct t cell epitopes , i.e. , ones with low sequence identity , are in fact more biochemically similar than expected . additionally , an analysis of hiv immunogenicity data with our model showed that ctls have the tendency to respond mostly to peptides that do not resemble self - antigens . conclusions : t cell cross - reactivity can thus , to an extent greater than earlier appreciated , be explained by amino acid similarity . the results presented in this paper will help resolving some of the long - lasting discussions in the field of t cell cross - reactivity . 
ab54f13666ed771c15684d73ff6bcc7c92b8ae05	background : the common cold questionnaire ( ccq ) is used to discriminate those with and without a viral infection . its usefulness in people with acute asthma is unknown . our aim was to assess the ability of the ccq to detect viral infection and to monitor recovery during a viral induced asthma exacerbation and confirmed by virological testing . methodology / principal findings : we studied subjects ( $ 7 yrs ) admitted to hospital with acute asthma and diagnosed as positive ( n = 63 ) , or negative to viral infection ( n = 27 ) according to molecular and virological testing from respiratory samples . ccq , asthma history and asthma control questionnaires were completed and repeated 4 - 6 weeks later . sensitivity , specificity , and response to change of the ccq were assessed by receiver operator curve ( roc ) analysis and effect size calculation respectively . the ccq did not discriminate between viral and non - viral infection for subjects with asthma ( sensitivity = 76.2 % ; specificity = 29.6 % ) . roc analysis could not differentiate between positive or negative virus in subjects with asthma . the ccq had a large response to change following recovery ( effect size = 1.01 ) . 39 % of subjects recovering from viral exacerbation remained positive to virological testing at follow - up despite improvement in clinical symptoms . the ccq reflected clinical improvement in these subjects , thus providing additional information to complement virological testing . conclusions / significance : the ccq is a useful instrument for monitoring response to viral infection in people with asthma . reliable differentiation between viral and non - viral asthma exacerbations was not achieved with the ccq and requires specific virological testing . when combined with virological testing , the ccq should be a useful outcome measure for evaluating therapies in viral - induced asthma . 
ab6bcf99f47aef2fcfaaeb674a6a7436a575581e	different epidemiological models , from the classical sir system to more sophisticated ones involving population compartments for socially distanced , quarantined , infection aware , asymptomatic infected , and other individuals , share some remarkable dynamic characteristics when contact rates are subject to periodic or one - shot changes . in simple pulsed isolation policies , a linear relationship is found among optimal start time and duration for reduction of the infected peak . if a single interval social distancing starts too early or too late it will be ineffective with respect to decreasing the peak of infection . on the other hand , the nonlinearity of epidemic models leads to non - monotone behavior of the peak of infected population under periodic relaxation policies . this observation led us to hypothesize that an additional single interval social distancing at a proper time can significantly decrease the infected peak of periodic policies , and we verified this improvement . 2 . modeling the effects of social distancing for an infection aware population . this can be done by changing the contact rates between the compartments , or by modeling the behavior of a population that alters its social interactions because of observed infections or deaths [ 44 , 45 ] . the latter technique has recently been applied to 47 ] . 3 . sub - dividing populations into regions , each described by local parameters . such regions may be cities , neighborhoods , or communities [ 48 ] . this framework allows modelers to capture the virus spread and population mobility geographically [ 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 ] . these models have been recently used to understand the spread of covid-19 in china [ 54 ] , italy [ 55 ] , belgium [ 56 ] , and india [ 57 , 58 ] . 
ab6d4e29549359ce647a22e67e1e83c4873ce388	consider the situation where an analyst has a bayesian statistical model that performs well for continuous data . however , suppose the observed data set consists of multiple response types ( e.g. , continuous , count - valued , bernoulli trials , etc . ) , which are distributed from more than one class of distributions . we refer to these types of data as " multi - response " data sets . the goal of this article is to introduce a reasonable easy - to - implement all - purpose method that " converts " a bayesian statistical model for continuous responses ( call this the preferred model ) into a bayesian model for multi - response data sets . to do this , we consider a transformation of the data , such that the transformed data can be be reasonably modeled using the preferred model . what is unique with our strategy is that we treat the transformations as unknown and use a bayesian approach to model this uncertainty . the implementation of our bayesian approach to unknown transformations is straightforward , and involves two steps . the first step produces posterior replicates of the transformed data from a latent conjugate multivariate ( lcm ) model . the second step involves generating values from the posterior distribution implied by the preferred model . we demonstrate the flexibility of our model through an application to bayesian additive regression trees ( bart ) , spatial mixed effects ( sme ) models , and the multivariate spatio - temporal mixed effects model ( mstm ) . to further illustrate the potential wide use of this approach , we provide an analysis of zero - inflated records of public costs due to natural disasters obtained from the national oceanic atmospheric association 's ( noaa ) national centers for environmental information ( ncei ) .

abf6f66d8e18b652d10944bb21e19debca5dc5e8	the scutellaria species ( lamiaceae ) is used as a source of flavonoids to treat a variety of diseases in traditional medicine . in spite of many reports about the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of some species of this genus , anticancer researches on one of the iranian species s. litwinowii have not yet been conducted . the cytotoxic properties of total methanol extract of s. litwinowii and its fractions were investigated on different cancer cell lines including ags , hela , mcf-7 , pc12 and nih 3t3 . meanwhile , the role of apoptosis in this toxicity was explored . the cells were cultured in dmem medium and incubated with different concentrations of herb plant extracts . cell viability was quantitated by mtt assay . apoptotic cells were determined using propidium iodide staining of dna fragmentation by flow cytometry ( sub - g1 peak ) . scutellaria litwinowii inhibited the growth of malignant cells in a dose - dependent manner . among solvent fractions of s. litwinowii , the methylene chloride fraction was found to be more toxic compared to other fractions . the ic 50 values of this fraction against ags , hela , mcf-7 and pc12 cell lines after 24 h were determined , 121.2 ± 3.1 , 40.9 ± 2.5 , 115.9 ± 3.5 and 64.5 ± 3.4 μg / ml , respectively . scutellaria litwinowii induced a sub - g1 peak in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells compared to control cells indicating that apoptotic cell death is involved in s. litwinowii toxicity . scutellaria litwinowii exerts cytotoxic and proapototic effects in a variety of malignant cell lines and could be considered as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment . 
ac0ed4e3ae92a0e194ea6808c289a0b6224ea054	control strategies enforced by health agencies are a major type of practice to contain influenza outbreaks . another type of practice is the voluntary preventive behavior of individuals , such as receiving vaccination , taking antiviral drugs , and wearing face masks . these two types of practices take effects concurrently in influenza containment , but little attention has been paid to their combined effectiveness . this article estimates this combined effectiveness using established simulation models in the urbanized area of buffalo , ny , usa . three control strategies are investigated , including : targeted antiviral prophylaxis ( tap ) , workplace / school closure , community travel restriction , as well as the combination of the three . all control strategies are simulated with and without regard to individual preventive behavior , and the resulting effectiveness are compared . the simulation outcomes suggest that weaker control strategies could suffice to contain influenza epidemics , because individuals voluntarily adopt preventive behavior , rendering these weaker strategies more effective than would otherwise have been expected . the preventive behavior of individuals could save medical resources for control strategies and avoid unnecessary socio - economic interruptions . this research adds a human behavioral dimension into the simulation of control strategies and offers new insights into disease containment . health policy makers are recommended to review current control strategies and comprehend preventive behavior patterns of local populations before making decisions on influenza containment .

ac2d8a1d73af15edaac54abaca97b45d5dcd285b	in this letter we show that multiband observations of stellar - mass binary black holes by the next generation of ground - based observatories ( 3 g ) and the space - based laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) would facilitate a comprehensive test of general relativity by simultaneously measuring all the post - newtonian ( pn ) coefficients . multiband observations would measure most of the known pn phasing coefficients to an accuracy below a few percent - two orders - of - magnitude better than the best bounds achievable from even ' golden ' binaries in the 3 g or lisa bands . such multiparameter bounds would play a pivotal role in constraining the parameter space of modified theories of gravity beyond general relativity . introduction : gravitational wave ( gw ) observations have provided a first glimpse of the strong - field dynamics of binary black holes ( bbhs ) [ 1 , 2 ] . they have also allowed us to place the first ever constraints on the possible departures from general relativity ( gr ) [ 3 , 4 ] in this regime . parametrized tests of the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to gr [ 5][6][7][8 ] are among the most important theory - agnostic , null - tests of gr that are performed using gw observations . these tests make use of the analytical prediction of the structure of the phase evolution using the pn approximation to gr [ 9 ] . in the pn approximation the dynamics of the binary is treated as an adiabatic process and einstein 's field equations are solved under the assumption of slow motion and weak gravitational fields . this is an excellent approximation for the " inspiral " phase of the compact binary dynamics where the two stars spiral - in under the influence of radiation back reaction , but the time - scale of radiation reaction is large compared to the orbital time - scale . gravitational waveform from a compact binary coalescence , in the frequency domain , have the well - known form [ 10 ]

ae80fe12be5b66d621401a3bb005769f784f52cf	background and objective : the covid-19 can cause severe pneumonia and is estimated to have a high impact on the healthcare system . early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system . the standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest x - ray ( cxr ) and computed tomography ( ct ) scan . although ct scan is the gold standard , cxr are still useful because it is cheaper , faster and more widespread . this study aims to identify pneumonia caused by covid-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only cxr images . methods : in order to achieve the objectives , we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives : i ) a multi - class classification ; ii ) hierarchical classification , since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy . given the natural data imbalance in this domain , we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re - balance the classes distribution . we observed that , texture is one of the main visual attributes of cxr images , our classification schema extract features using some well - known texture descriptors and also using a pre - trained cnn model . we also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once . to evaluate the approach , we composed a database , named rydls-20 , containing cxr images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as cxr images of healthy lungs . the classes distribution follows a real - world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others . results : the proposed approach tested in rydls-20 achieved a macroavg f1-score of 0.65 using a multi - class approach and a f1-score of 0.89 for the covid-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario . conclusions : as far as we know , the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for covid-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes . we must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task , which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best covid-19 recognition rate obtained here . the covid-19 pandemic can be considered severe due to its high transmissibility and seriousness [ 4 ] . the impact in the healthcare system is also high due to the amount of people that needs icu admission and mechanical ventilators for long periods [ 5 ] . in this scenario , early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system . in this con-20 text , artificial intelligence ( ai ) based solutions can provide a cheap and accurate diagnosis for covid-19 and other types of pneumonia . the standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest x - ray ( cxr ) and computed tomography ( ct ) scan . the cxr is the primary radiographic exam to evaluate pneumonia , but it not as precise as the ct scan and has higher 25 misdiagnosis rates . nevertheless , the cxr is still useful because it is cheaper , faster , expose the patient to less radiation and is more widespread than ct scan [ 6 , 7 ] . the task of pneumonia identification is not easy , the professional reviewing the cxr needs to look for white patches in the lungs , the white patches are the lungs ' air sacs filled with pus or water . however , these white 30 patches can also be confused with tuberculosis or bronchitis , for example . in this study , we aim to explore the identification of different types of pneumonia caused by multiple pathogens using only cxr images . despite the ct scan being the gold standard for the pneumonia diagnosis , we focused only on cxr images due to its reduced cost , fast result and its general availability , 35 since the ct scan machines are still scarse and costly . specifically , we considered pneumonia caused by viruses ( covid-19 , sars , mers and varicella ) , bacteria ( streptococcus ) and fungi ( pneumocystis ) . moreover , because of the recent pandemic which is ravaging the world , the main focus of this work is the covid-19 pneumonia , and our principal goal is to reach the best possible 40 identification rate for it among other types of pneumonia and healthy lungs . to support that , we have taken into account two perspectives in the results ' evaluation : first , we considered all classes mentioned above and summarized the results using a macro - avg f1-score ; second , we considered only the covid-19 class and summarized the results using f1-score . 45 
aec923adf0e16d218315a3083aaa71fb9ddb8b39	although the ecological importance of coinfection is increasingly recognized , analyses of microbial pathogen dynamics in wildlife usually focus on an ad hoc subset of the species present due to technological limitations on detection . here we demonstrate the use of expression profiles for immunological genes ( pattern recognition receptors , cytokines and transcription factors ) as a means to identify , without preconception , the likelihood of important acute microbial infections in wildlife . using a wood mouse population in the uk as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci , typical of an acute microbial infection . these clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population . animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with ' ' normal ' ' expression patterns . if the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection . the form of survey described here , combined with next generation nucleic acids sequencing methods for the broad detection of microbial infectious agents in individuals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles , could be a powerful tool for revealing unrecognized , ecologically important infectious agents circulating in wildlife populations .

afd83a90943b4d9103daaf9507267b65e257c85c	we report a hereditary leukodystrophy in standard schnauzer puppies . clinical signs occurred shortly after birth or started at an age of under 4 weeks and included apathy , dysphoric vocalization , hypermetric ataxia , intension tremor , head tilt , circling , proprioceptive deficits , seizures and ventral strabismus consistent with a diffuse intracranial lesion . magnetic resonance imaging revealed a diffuse white matter disease without mass effect . macroscopically , the cerebral white matter showed a gelatinous texture in the centrum semiovale . a mild hydrocephalus internus was noted . histopathologically , a severe multifocal reduction of myelin formation and moderate diffuse edema without inflammation was detected leading to the diagnosis of leukodystrophy . combined linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping in two related families delineated critical intervals of approximately 29 mb . the comparison of whole genome sequence data of one affected standard schnauzer to 221 control genomes revealed a single private homozygous protein changing variant in the critical intervals , tsen54 : c.371g > a or p.(gly124asp ) . tsen54 encodes the trna splicing endonuclease subunit 54 . in humans , several variants in tsen54 were reported to cause different types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia . the genotypes at the c.371g > a variant were perfectly associated with the leukodystrophy phenotype in 12 affected standard schnauzers and almost 1000 control dogs from different breeds . these results suggest that tsen54 : c.371g > a causes the leukodystrophy . the identification of a candidate causative variant enables genetic testing so that the unintentional breeding of affected standard schnauzers can be avoided in the future . our findings extend the known genotype - phenotype correlation for tsen54 variants . various hereditary diseases of the cerebral white matter occur in humans and dogs . we describe a new leukodystrophy in standard schnauzers . genetic mapping and whole genome sequence analysis identified a likely candidate causative variant in the tsen54 gene encoding trna splicing endonuclease 54 . these results provide new information about the role of tsen54 in cell metabolism and the development of the central nervous system in the late gestational and early post - natal period . the affected dogs potentially represent a translational large animal model for similar leukoencephalopathies in human medicine . the clinical phenotype in schnauzers included multifocal central nervous system signs . a holistic pathogenically driven understanding of disease initiation and perpetuation requires a solid analysis of the underlying genetics and characterization of the disease phenotype at the clinical and cellular as well as sub - cellular level . in contrast to the canine phenotype with a predominant manifestation in the cerebrum white matter , other tsen54 variants in humans have been reported to result in a different pathological phenotype characterized by pontocerebellar hypoplasia . the differences between humans and dogs underscore the need for comparative analysis at the clinical , pathological and molecular level to understand species - specific protein mediated pathways , interactions and outcomes .

aff6401fad7ddccec2a7286d6b593bc474e9f07b	here , we report the first quantitative experimental study into the molecular basis of the transmission of mechanical signal that originates from biochemical reaction focusing on the length of carbon chain . we designed an experiment by using n - alkanethiols with a same carboxyl group and different chain lengths ( n = 1 , 5 , 10 and 15 ) to immobilize a same receptor molecule on the gold surface of a microcantilever , and detected the nanomechanical response of biochemical reaction . the sensitivity of the microcantilever was found to be greatly influenced by the chain length of linker that is between the receptor molecule and the microcantilever surface . the efficiency of stress transmission increases significantly with decreasing length of carbon chain . at the same time , we develop a label - free microcantilever sensor for highly sensitive detection of glycyrrhizic acid ( gl ) . the detection limit of the microcantilever sensor for gl is found to be as low as 20 pg / ml for the shortest linker ( n = 1 ) , which is 500 times lower than the longest linker ( n = 15 ) and 50 times lower than that of the corresponding icelisa . these findings will provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of stress transmission , which may be exploited for biochemical sensor and nanoactuation applications .

b216f710cf7a8d27ebb94fccf7da7650456d3eab	we introduce a compact pangenome representation based on an optimal segmentation concept that aims to reconstruct founder sequences from a multiple sequence alignment ( msa ) . such founder sequences have the feature that each row of the msa is a recombination of the founders . several linear time dynamic programming algorithms have been previously devised to optimize segmentations that induce founder blocks that then can be concatenated into a set of founder sequences . all possible concatenation orders can be expressed as a founder block graph . we observe a key property of such graphs : if the node labels ( founder segments ) do not repeat in the paths of the graph , such graphs can be indexed for efficient string matching . we call such graphs segment repeat - free founder block graphs . we give a linear time algorithm to construct a segment repeat - free founder block graph given an msa . the algorithm combines techniques from the founder segmentation algorithms ( cazaux et al . spire 2019 ) and fully - functional bidirectional burrows - wheeler index ( belazzougui and cunial , cpm 2019 ) . we derive a succinct index structure to support queries of arbitrary length in the paths of the graph . experiments on an msa of sar - cov-2 strains are reported . an msa of size 410 × 29811 is compacted in one minute into a segment repeat - free founder block graph of 3900 nodes and 4440 edges . the maximum length and total length of node labels is 12 and 34968 , respectively . the index on the graph takes only 3 % of the size of the msa .

b7afb00c0a51a30372992a1e79f9b5ae48ef48a1	the human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) is a newly described member of the paramyxoviridae family belonging to the metapneumovirus genus . since its initial description in 2001 , hmpv has been reported in most parts of the world and isolated from the respiratory tract of subjects from all age groups . despite the fact that prospective and case - control studies have been limited , the epidemiology and clinical manifestations associated with hmpv have been found to be reminiscent of those of the human respiratory syncytial virus , with most severe respiratory tract infections occurring in infants , elderly subjects , and immunocompromised hosts . additional research is needed to define the pathogenesis of this viral infection and the host 's specific immune response . acute respiratory tract infections ( artis ) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide . a variety of viruses , including the influenza viruses , human respiratory syncytial virus ( hrsv ) , parainfluenza viruses , adenoviruses , rhinoviruses , and coronaviruses , have been associated with clinical syndromes ranging from mild illnesses , such as the common cold , to more severe devastating conditions , such as pneumonia . however , ∼50 % of the cases of community - acquired pneumonia in adults and 15%-35 % of cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in pediatric patients are still without a known etiology [ 1 - 3 ] . along with inadequate diagnostic methods , this observation also suggests that other respiratory tract infectious agents may exist and remain to be identified . a new respiratory virus , the human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) was first isolated in 2001 from nasopharyngeal aspirates ( npas ) obtained from young children in the netherlands [ 4 ] . on the basis of morphological , biochemical , and genetic features , hmpv was tentatively classified with avian metapneumovirus ( apv ) , the causative agent of an upper respiratory tract disease in turkeys and other birds [ 5 ] , in the metapneumovirus genus . the latter , together with the pneumovirus genus ( containing hrsv as the type species ) , is note added in proof . human metapneumovirus was recently isolated from previously virus - negative nasal wash specimens from 49 ( 20 % ) of 248 young children consulting at the vanderbilt clinic ( nashville , tn ) for lower respiratory tract illnesses [ 44 ] . extrapolation of these results to the entire cohort of patients observed at this institution over a 25-year period ( 1976 - 2001 ) suggests that the prevalence of human metapneumovirus infection was ∼12 % in all outpatient children with lower respiratory tract diseases .

b95e82e0343a470f5b39c97eae9f8541e218b76d	canine enteric coronavirus ( ccov ) is an alphacoronavirus infecting dogs that is closely related to enteric coronaviruses of cats and pigs . while ccov has traditionally caused mild gastro - intestinal clinical signs , there are increasing reports of lethal ccov infections in dogs , with evidence of both gastrointestinal and systemic viral dissemination . consequently , ccov is now considered to be an emerging infectious disease of dogs . in addition to the two known serotypes of ccov , novel recombinant variants of ccov have been found containing spike protein n - terminal domains ( ntds ) that are closely related to those of feline and porcine strains . the increase in disease severity in dogs and the emergence of novel ccovs can be attributed to the high level of recombination within the spike gene that can occur during infection by more than one ccov type in the same host . 
b974706d8364e8f0c7d184ffdb0d331b0425b86f	an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has spread around the world . it is debatable whether asymptomatic covid-19 virus carriers are contagious . we report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts , which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers . 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic covid-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research . they were divided into three groups : 35 patients , 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs . we extracted their epidemiological information , clinical records , auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules . the median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days . cardiovascular disease accounted for 25 % among original diseases of patients . apart from hospital staffs , both patients and family members were isolated medically . during the quarantine , seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms , where fever was the most common one . the blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range . all ct images showed no sign of covid-19 infection . no severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test . in summary , all the 455 contacts were excluded from sars - cov-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic sars - cov-2 carriers might be weak .

bd21184623ceed45f1cede4066b540ff330ccb63	canine kobuvirus ( cakv ) is a member of the picornaviridae family and the kobuvirus genus . cakv was first described in fecal samples from diarrheic dogs in the usa in 2011 , with subsequent reports in the uk , italy , south korea , china , tanzania , and japan . cakv is frequently identified in feces of animals with or without clinical signs of gastroenteritis . the present study investigated the presence of cakv in fecal samples from 53 diarrheic dogs from londrina , southern brazil . using a rt - pcr assay , cakv rna was identified in three dogs , resulting in an overall occurrence rate of 5.7 % . in addition , coinfection with canine parvovirus subtype 2b was detected in all cakv - positive diarrheic fecal samples . using a phylogenetic analysis based on the vp1 gene sequence , the brazilian cakv field strains were found to be very similar to a previously identified cakv strain from brazil that was found in the tissue of a puppy and were also found to be clustered with other cakv strains detected worldwide and other kobuvirus strains identified in mouse , feline , and human hosts . 
bd877345472e96bd0c01fbb169d47f2fdaad740b	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ( sars cov-2 ) . the sars cov-2 is transmitted more rapidly and readily than sars cov. both , sars cov and sars cov-2 via their glycosylated spike proteins recognize the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ( ace-2 ) receptor . we generated multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for representative spike proteins of sars cov and sars cov-2 from various host sources in order to analyze the specificity in sars cov-2 spike proteins required for causing infection in humans . our results show that among the genomes analysed , two sequence regions in the n - terminal domain ( ntd ) ; " mesefr " and " syltpg " are specific to human sars cov-2 . in the receptor binding domain ( rbd ) , two sequence regions ; " vggny " and " eiyqagstpcngv " and a disulfide bridge connecting 480c and 488c in the extended loop are structural determinants for the recognition of human ace-2 receptor . the complete genome analysis of representative sars covs from bat , civet , human host sources and human sars cov-2 identified the bat genome ( genbank code : mn996532.1 ) as closest to the recent novel human sars cov-2 genomes . the bat sars cov genomes ( genbank codes : mg772933 and mg772934 ) are evolutionary intermediates in the mutagenesis progression towards becoming human sars cov-2 . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . cov-2 is transmitted from person to person contact via respiratory secretions during coughing and sneezing . infection of this highly pathogenic virus can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome which impacts the lung and heart functions . the prominent symptoms of this viral infection are flu , severe respiratory , enteric and neurological disorders , resulting in increased white blood cells and kidney failure . there are no vaccines or drugs available to combat this deadly infectious disease and there is no strategic plan to treat the infected patients . hence , there is a need to develop specific anti - sars cov-2 vaccines and drugs to treat infected patients , in order to reduce viral shedding and further transmission in populations . the sars cov-2 comprises positive - sense single - stranded rna genome of size 29 - 30 kb and belongs to the coronaviridae family and betacoronavirus sub - family . mammals such as bats are the main reservoir of betacoronaviruses , but due to the zoonotic contacts and viral genomic mutations , sars cov-2 has recently crossed species and caused infections in humans . 3 research findings have pointed that previous zoonotic cov infections such as , sars cov , that first infected humans in the guangdong province of southern china in 2002 was transmitted from bats and civets 4 - 8 , the mers cov that originated in bats was first this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . allows entry of the virus into host cells . a sequence motif " prra " , from 681p to 684a ( amino acid numbering is according to ncbi code : qhd43416 ) that is gained only in the human sars cov-2 spike proteins is referred to as furin cleavage site . [ 28][29 ] in this work , we identify the sequence regions in human sars cov-2 ; a six residues insertion sequence " mesefr " from 153 m to 158r and another six residues insertion sequence " syltpg " from 247s to 252g. the bat sars cov spike protein qhr63300 ( genbank code : mn996532.1 ) also comprises the identical sequence regions as above . in two bat spike proteins , avp78042 ( genbank code : mg772934 ) and avp78031 ( mg772933 ) , a six residues sequence " sirefa " and a three residues sequence " gdp " are present at equivalent positions , respectively . the insertion sequence regions present in human sars cov-2 , 153mesefr158 and 247syltpg252 are associated with the ntd and are located distant from the ace-2 binding site . from the three - dimensional structure of human sars cov-2 , we infer that these regions are likely to be exposed towards the surface of the spike protein in ntd . in human sars cov-2 , there are two insertion regions ; a five residues insertion " vggny " from 445v to 449y , and a thirteen residues insertion " eiyqagstpcngv " from 471e to 483v. the bat sars cov spike protein qhr63300 has also gained equivalent insertions with the sequences ; " eggnf " and " eiyqagskpcngq " . it is interesting to note that the bat sars cov qhr63300 has already acquired a thirteen residues sequence region , whereas all other spike proteins that recognize the ace-2 receptor in sars cov comprise a twelve residues sequence region . the figure 2a was generated by editing the msa in figure    s1 to depict the sequence regions discussed above in representative spike proteins from the four host sources ( bat , civet , human sars cov and human sars cov-2 ) . the two sequence regions , " vggny " and " eiyqagstpcngv " , are part of the rbd and involved in recognition of the ace-2 receptor in human host . their absence in the bat sars cov at equivalent positions may be responsible for their inability to bind human ace-2 . to study this , we have analyzed the three - dimensional structures of human sars cov ( pdb code : 6acg ) 30 and the rbd domain of human sars cov-2 ( 6m17 ) complexed with ace-2 this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome .

be6c32a4d351f410d96b2a85713933f1c161809f	different ways of calculating mortality ratios during epidemics can yield widely different results , particularly during the covid-19 pandemic . we formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration - dependent sir model to define individual - and population - based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios . the key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the length of time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection . we stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio ( cfr ) , the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of infected cases to date . using available data on the recent sars - cov-2 outbreaks and simple assumptions , we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences . informed by our modeling , we propose a more systematic method to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and errors in the data . 
bed1c9834dbd81a9e254940379f80c3447a122e9	the study of virus disease emergence , whether it can be predicted and how it might be prevented , has become a major research topic in biomedicine . here we show that efforts to predict disease emergence commonly conflate fundamentally different evolutionary and epidemiological time scales , and are likely to fail because of the enormous number of unsampled viruses that could conceivably emerge in humans . although we know much about the patterns and processes of virus evolution on evolutionary time scales as depicted in family - scale phylogenetic trees , these data have little predictive power to reveal the short - term microevolutionary processes that underpin cross - species transmission and emergence . truly understanding disease emergence therefore requires a new mechanistic and integrated view of the factors that allow or prevent viruses spreading in novel hosts . we present such a view , suggesting that both ecological and genetic aspects of virus emergence can be placed within a simple population genetic framework , which in turn highlights the importance of host population size and density in determining whether emergence will be successful . despite this framework , we conclude that a more practical solution to preventing and containing the successful emergence of new diseases entails ongoing virological surveillance at the human - animal interface and regions of ecological disturbance . prediction is very difficult , especially about the future . -niels bohr

bf603ce616f92337f3b19b27b97b6bdbe5c1f21b	the flagellated protozoan trichomonas vaginalis is an obligate human genitourinary parasite and the most frequent cause of sexually transmitted disease worldwide . most clinical isolates of t. vaginalis are persistently infected with one or more double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) viruses from the genus trichomonasvirus , family totiviridae , which appear to influence not only protozoan biology but also human disease . here we describe the three - dimensional structure of trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 ( tvv1 ) virions , as determined by electron cryomicroscopy and icosahedral image reconstruction . the structure reveals a t ‫؍‬ 1 capsid comprising 120 subunits , 60 in each of two nonequivalent positions , designated a and b , as previously observed for fungal totiviridae family members . the putative protomer is identified as an asymmetric ab dimer consistent with either decamer or tetramer assembly intermediates . the capsid surface is notable for raised plateaus around the icosahedral 5-fold axes , with canyons connecting the 2-and 3-fold axes . capsid - spanning channels at the 5-fold axes are unusually wide and may facilitate release of the viral genome , promoting dsrna - dependent immunoinflammatory responses , as recently shown upon the exposure of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells to either tvv - infected t. vaginalis or purified tvv1 virions . despite extensive sequence divergence , conservative features of the capsid reveal a helix - rich fold probably derived from an ancestor shared with fungal totiviridae family members . also notable are mass spectrometry results assessing the virion proteins as a complement to structure determination , which suggest that translation of the tvv1 rna - dependent rna polymerase in fusion with its capsid protein involves ؊2 , and not ؉1 , ribosomal frameshifting , an uncommonly found mechanism to date . hiv . it is an extracellular parasite that , in turn , commonly hosts infections with double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) viruses , trichomonasviruses , which appear to exacerbate disease through signaling of immunoinflammatory responses by human epithelial cells . here we report the first three - dimensional structure of a trichomonasvirus , which is also the first such structure of any protozoan dsrna virus ; show that it has unusually wide channels at the capsid vertices , with potential for releasing the viral genome and promoting dsrna - dependent responses by human cells ; and provide evidence that it uses ؊2 ribosomal frameshifting , an uncommon mechanism , to translate its rna polymerase in fusion with its capsid protein . these findings provide both mechanistic and translational insights concerning the role of trichomonasviruses in aggravating disease attributable to t. vaginalis . parent kn , takagi y , cardone g , olson nh , ericsson m , yang m , lee y , asara jm , fichorova rn , baker ts , nibert ml . 2013 . structure of a protozoan virus from the human genitourinary parasite trichomonas vaginalis . mbio 4(2):e00056 - 13 . 
bfaeeaddeb65011d6a873d35db972d986ab8a0a8	as urban areas continue to expand and replace natural and agricultural landscapes , the ability to manage and conserve native wildlife within urban environments is becoming increasingly important . to do so we first need to understand species ' responses to local - level habitat attributes in order to inform the decision - making process and on - ground conservation actions . patterns in the occurrence of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species in 59 sites located in remnant urban habitat fragments of brisbane city were assessed against local - level environmental characteristics of each site . cluster analysis , multidimensional scaling ordination , and principal axis correlation were used to investigate relationships between species ' occurrences and environmental characteristics . native reptiles were most strongly associated with the presence of termite mounds , a high amount of fallen woody material , and a moderate amount of weed cover . native small mammals were most strongly associated with the presence of grass trees ( xanthorrhoea spp . ) , and both reptiles and small mammals were negatively influenced by increased soil compaction . significant floristic characteristics were considered to be important as structural , rather than compositional , habitat elements . therefore , habitat structure , rather than vegetation composition , appears to be most important for determining native , terrestrial reptile and small mammal species assemblages in urban forest fragments . we discuss the management implications in relation to human disturbances and local - level management of urban remnants .

c0399922a636e04aa6b5ffe2989e4d147ccd5626	to gain insight into the mechanism of lactobacillus acidophilus ( l. acidophilus ) s - layer protein antiviral activity , we examined how s - layer protein impacts porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) infection and pedv - induced apoptosis of vero cells . pretreatment ( exclusion assay ) , coincubation ( competition assay ) , and post - treatment ( displacement assay ) of pedv - infected vero cells with the s - layer protein was examined . interestingly , significant inhibition of pedv by s - layer protein was only observed in the exclusion assay . in vero cells infected with pedv , we found that apoptosis was mediated by activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in the late stage of infection . when pedv - infected vero cells were pretreated with s - layer protein , rates of vero cell apoptosis were markedly decreased and cell damage was significantly reduced , as evaluated by flow cytometry and microscopy . detailed analyses showed that the s - layer protein inhibited caspase-8 and caspase-3 activity . taken together , our results suggest that l. acidophilus s - layer protein plays an inhibitory role during pedv infection of vero cells , and that the antagonistic activity of the protein is not via competition with pedv for binding sites . in addition , the findings suggest that l. acidophilus s - layer protein protects against pedv - induced apoptosis through reduced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation in the later stages of infection . this mechanism may represent a novel approach for antagonizing pedv and other viruses . 
c03bbc08094d829261ec4e94b52a0c2b65027e31	background : global health has increasingly gained international visibility and prominence . first and foremost , the spread of cross - border infectious disease arouses a great deal of media and public interest , just as it drives research priorities of faculty and academic programmes . at the same time , global health has become a major area of philanthropic action . despite the importance it has acquired over the last two decades , the complex collective term " global health " still lacks a uniform use today . objectives : the objective of this paper is to present the existing definitions of global health , and analyse their meaning and implications . the paper emphasises that the term " global health " goes beyond the territorial meaning of " global " , connects local and global , and refers to an explicitly political concept . global health regards health as a rights - based , universal good ; it takes into account social inequalities , power asymmetries , the uneven distribution of resources and governance challenges . thus , it represents the necessary continuance of public health in the face of diverse and ubiquitous global challenges . a growing number of international players , however , focus on publicprivate partnerships and privatisation and tend to promote biomedical reductionism through predominantly technological solutions . moreover , the predominant global health concept reflects the inherited hegemony of the global north . it takes insufficient account of the global burden of disease , which is mainly characterised by noncommunicable conditions , and the underlying social determinants of health . conclusions : beyond resilience and epidemiological preparedness for preventing cross - border disease threats , global health must focus on the social , economic and political determinants of health . biomedical and technocratic reductionism might be justified in times of acute health crises but entails the risk of selective access to health care . consistent health - in - all policies are required for ensuring health for all and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries . global health must first and foremost pursue the enforcement of the universal right to health and contribute to overcoming global hegemony .

c0c7b00ab24cc387be12eab10e6eb3e304d24f7d	carbon monoxide ( co ) , a gaseous second messenger , arises in biological systems during the oxidative catabolism of heme by the heme oxygenase ( ho ) enzymes . ho exists as constitutive ( ho-2 , ho-3 ) and inducible isoforms ( ho-1 ) , the latter which responds to regulation by multiple stress - stimuli . ho-1 confers protection in vitro and in vivo against oxidative cellular stress . although the redox active compounds that are generated from ho activity ( i.e. iron , biliverdin - ixα , and bilirubin - ixα ) potentially modulate oxidative stress resistance , increasing evidence points to cytoprotective roles for co . though not reactive , co regulates vascular processes such as vessel tone , smooth muscle proliferation , and platelet aggregation , and possibly functions as a neurotransmitter . the latter effects of co depend on the activation of guanylate cyclase activity by direct binding to the heme moiety of the enzyme , stimulating the production of cyclic 3′:5′-guanosine monophosphate . co potentially interacts with other intracellular hemoprotein targets , though little is known about the functional significance of such interactions . recent progress indicates that co exerts novel anti - inflammatory and anti - apoptotic effects dependent on the modulation of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk)-signaling pathway . by virtue of these effects , co confers protection in oxidative lung injury models , and likely plays a role in ho-1 mediated tissue protection .

c2fcd9c91b07be58e2f41e2df822f132a4e2be94	the covid-19 pandemic poses two challenges to healthcare providers . firstly , a high number of patients require hospital admission . second , a high number of healthcare staff are either falling ill with the infection , or self - isolating . this poses significant problems for the staffing of busy hospital departments . we have created a simple model which allows users to stress test their rota . the model provides plots of staff availability over time using either a constant infection rate , or a changing infection rate fitted to population - based infection curves . it allows users to gauge the extent and timing of dips in staff availability . the basic constant infection rate model is available within an on - line web application ( https://covid19.shef.ac.uk ) . as for any model , our work is imperfect . however , it allows a range of infection rates to be simulated quickly across different work patterns . we hope it will be useful to those planning staff deployment and will stimulate debate on the most effective patterns of work during the covid-19 epidemic .

c5ff66ecd15e6956073e57a2ecfb7b06f6f6fba6	objective to assess site variability and concomitant respiratory support related to the timing of caffeine discontinuation , and compare clinical characteristics of infants who discontinued caffeine before vs. within the last week of hospitalization . study design cohort study of 81,110 infants < 35 weeks gestational age and < 1500 g birth weight discharged from 304 neonatal intensive care units from 2001 - 2016 . results the mean postmenstrual age at caffeine discontinuation ranged from 32 to 37 weeks among sites . respiratory support at the time of discontinuation was common , but variable , with 0 - 57 % of infants receiving positive airway pressure at caffeine discontinuation by site . infants who discontinued caffeine within the last week of hospitalization had longer total duration of caffeine , but were discharged from the hospital at an earlier postmenstrual age . conclusion there was substantial variability among sites in the timing of caffeine discontinuation before discharge and respiratory support at the time of caffeine discontinuation . 
c61bc72220e0d9fbfa5ac73132178ef7b7b580bb	background : since its first detection in december 2019 , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has spread rapidly around the world . although there have been several studies investigating prognostic factors for severe covid-19 , there have been no such studies in korea . methods : we performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with confirmed covid-19 hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in daegu , korea . demographic , clinical , laboratory , and outcome data were collected and analyzed . severe disease was defined as a composite outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome , intensive care unit care , or death . results : diabetes mellitus ( odds ratio [ or ] , 19.15 ; 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.90 - 193.42 ; p = 0.012 ) , body temperature ≥ 37.8 ° c ( or , 10.91 ; 95 % ci , 1.35 - 88.36 ; p = 0.025 ) , peripheral oxygen saturation < 92 % ( or , 33.31 ; 95 % ci , 2.45 - 452.22 ; p = 0.008 ) , and creatine kinase - mb ( ck - mb ) > 6.3 ( or , 56.84 ; 95 % ci , 2.64 - 1,223.78 , p = 0.010 ) at admission were associated with higher risk of severe covid-19 . the likelihood of development of severe covid-19 increased with an increasing number of prognostic factors . conclusion : in conclusion , we found that diabetes mellitus , body temperature ≥ 37.8 ° c , peripheral oxygen saturation < 92 % , and ck - mb > 6.3 are independent predictors of severe disease in hospitalized covid-19 patients . appropriate assessment of prognostic factors and close monitoring to provide the necessary interventions at the appropriate time in high - risk patients may reduce the case fatality rate of covid-19 . 
c638f8419b4f538922fe4887859ac340f24e6f61	background : decreased cancer incidence and reported changes to clinical management indicate that the covid-19 pandemic will result in diagnostic and treatment delays for cancer patients . we aimed to develop a flexible model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation on survival outcomes and healthcare costs based on a shift in the disease stage at treatment initiation . the stage - shift model estimates population - level health economic outcomes by weighting disease stage - specific outcomes by the distribution of stages at treatment initiation , assuming delays lead to stageprogression . it allows for extrapolation of population - level survival data using parametric distributions to calculate the expected survival in life years . the model was demonstrated based on an analysis of the impact of 3 and 6month delays for stage i breast cancer , colorectal cancer and lung cancer patients , and for t1 melanoma , based on australian data . in the absence of patient - level data about time to stage progression , two approaches were explored to estimate the proportion of patients that would experience a stage shift following the delay : 1 ) based on the relation between time to treatment initiation and overall survival ( breast , colorectal and lung cancer ) , and 2 ) based on the tumour growth rate ( melanoma ) . the model is available on http://stage-shift.personex.nl/. a shift from stage i to stage ii due to a 6-month delay is least likely for colorectal cancer patients , with an estimated proportion of 3 % of the stage i patients diagnosed in 2020 progressing to stage ii , resulting in 11 excess deaths after 5 years and a total of 96 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon . for breast and lung cancer , progression from stage i to stage ii due to a 6-month delay were slightly higher at 5 % ( breast cancer ) and 8 % ( lung cancer ) , resulting in 25 and 43 excess deaths after 5 years , and 239 and 373 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon , respectively . for melanoma , with 32 % of t1 patients progressing to t2 disease following a 6-month delay , the model estimated 270 excess death after 5 years and 2584 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon . conclusions : using a conservative 3-month delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation due to the covid-19 pandemic , this study predicts nearly 90 excess deaths and $ 12 million excess healthcare costs in australia over 5 years for the in 2020 diagnosed patients for 4 cancers . if the delays increase to 6 months , excess mortality and cost approach nearly 350 deaths and $ 46 million in australia . more accurate data on stage of disease during and after the covid-19 pandemic are critical to obtain more reliable estimates . 
c69550e29123d3f2c9ab39dd3ca65733df29864a	the objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory parameters distinguishing viral from nonviral lower respiratory tract infection in elderly patients and to determine the yield of virological diagnostics in elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infection . the study was conducted in a 184-bed geriatric department in a university hospital during 4 winter months . all consecutive elderly persons admitted with a lower respiratory tract infection were included in the study . clinical and laboratory parameters , a nasopharyngeal swab , and serological results for respiratory viruses were obtained for all participants . available blood and sputum cultures were analysed . a total of 165 elderly persons ( mean age , 82€6.8 years ) were hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection . familial flu - like illness ( or , 4.25 ; 95%ci , 1.4 - 13 ) , better functionality ( or , 4 ; 95%ci , 1.3 - 14.15 ) , and leucocyte count < 10 10 /l ( or , 3 ; 95%ci , 1.3 - 7.1 ) were predictive for viral lower respiratory tract infection . sixty ( 36.5 % ) definite diagnoses ( positive blood culture , viral culture , or serological test ) and seven ( 4.2 % ) probable diagnoses ( positive sputum culture ) were obtained . an early diagnosis ( within 72 h ) was possible in 38 ( 23 % ) and a late diagnosis in 29 ( 17.6 % ) participants . a nasopharyngeal swab contributed in 60.5 % of the cases to an early diagnosis . viral culture identified half ( 22/43 ) of the lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza but only one of six lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus . in conclusion , a history of flu - like illness in family members and a total leucocyte count within normal limits makes a viral cause more likely in elderly people hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection during winter . viral culture and rapid antigen detection are insensitive in elderly patients hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection . 
c6a8746299c87ada798da94722bc680192cc5c3b	coronavirus disease-2019 ( covid-19 ) outbreak due to novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) infection has come out as a major threat for mankind in recent times . it is continually taking an enormous toll on mankind by means of increasing number of deaths , associated comorbidities , and socioeconomic loss around the globe . unavailability of chemotherapeutics / vaccine has posed tremendous challenges to scientists and doctors for developing an urgent therapeutic strategy . in this connection , the present in silico study aims to understand the sequence divergence of spike protein ( the major infective protein of sars - cov-2 ) , its mode of interaction with the angiotensin - converting enzyme-2 receptor ( ace2 ) receptor of human and related animal hosts / reservoir . moreover , the involvement of the human toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) against the spike protein has also been demonstrated . our data indicated that the spike glycoprotein of sars - cov-2 is phylogenetically close to bat coronavirus and strongly binds with ace2 receptor protein from both human and bat origin . we have also found that cell surface tlrs , especially tlr4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from sars - cov-2 to induce inflammatory responses . the present study supported the zoonotic origin of sars - cov-2 from a bat and also revealed that tlr4 may have a crucial role in the virus - induced inflammatory consequences associated with covid-19 . therefore , selective targeting of tlr4-spike protein interaction by designing competitive tlr4-antagonists could pave a new way to treat covid-19 . finally , this study is expected to improve our understanding on the immunobiology of sars - cov-2 and could be useful in adopting spike protein , ace2 , or tlr - guided intervention strategy against covid-19 shortly . 
c6e3d75b88af31d669a4277ca72adee48a96a3ae	human bocavirus 1 ( hbov1 ) , a human parvovirus , belongs to the genus bocavirus of the parvoviridae family . it causes wheezing in young children with acute respiratory tract infections . hbov1 has been shown to infect polarized human airway epithelium ( hae ) made in house , and induces airway epithelial damage . in this study , two commercially available hae cultures , epiairway and mucilair hae , were examined for hbov1 infection . both hae cultures support fully productive hbov1 infection . infected epiairway and mucilair hae cultures showed loss of cilia , disruption of the tight junction barrier , and a significant decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance . notably , hbov1 persistent infection was demonstrated by maintaining hbov1-infected epiairway hae for as long as 50 days . after 2 days postinfection , progeny virus was produced consistently daily at a level of over 2 × 10 8 viral genome copies per culture ( 0.6 cm 2 ) . this study is the first to use commercial sources of hae cultures for hbov1 infection . the availability of these cultures will enable a wide range of laboratories to study hbov1 infection . 
c6ffc647a841257cc40d125408caca01651ee7ba	the pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) has tremendous consequences for our societies . knowledge of the seroprevalence of sars - cov-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate ( ifr ) . these measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions . blood donors comprise approximately 4.7 % of the similarly aged population of denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country . the objective of this study was to perform real - time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous sars - cov-2 infections and the population based ifr . all danish blood donors aged 17 - 69 years giving blood april 6 to 17 were tested for sars - cov-2 immunoglobulin m and g antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test . antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the ifr was calculated . the seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) . results : the first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7 % ( ci : 0.9 - 2.3 ) was calculated . the seroprevalence differed across areas . using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined ifr in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 ( ci : 59 - 154 ) infections . the ifr was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data . the ifr , including only individuals with no comorbidity , is likely several fold lower than the current estimate . this may have implications for risk mitigation . we have initiated real - time nationwide anti - sars - cov-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic .

c856a5583dad88feeb274cf1ba74ce99632d3d6c	background : porcine epidemic diarrhea ( ped ) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease caused by ped virus ( pedv ) , characterized by vomitting , watery diarrhea and fatal dehydration with high mortality in sucking piglets of one week of age . although pedv induced cell apoptosis has been established in vitro and in vivo , the functional protein that contributes to this event remains unclear . methods : the activation or cleavage of main apoptosis - associated molecular such as aifm1 , caspase-3 , caspase-8 , caspase-9 and parp in pedv infected host cells were analyzed by western blotting . the nuclear change of infected cell was monitored by confocal immunofluorescence assay . the overexpressing plasmids of 16 non - structural proteins ( nsp1 - 16 ) and 6 structural proteins ( m , n , e , orf3 , s1 and s2 ) were constructed by cloning . cell apoptosis induced by pedv or overexpression non - structural or structural proteins was measured by the flow cytometry assay . results : pedv could infect various host cells including vero , vero - e6 and marc-145 and cause obvious cytopathic effects , including roundup , cell fusion , cell membrane vacuolation , syncytium formation and cause apparent apoptosis . in infected cells , pedv - induced apoptosis is accompanied by nuclear concentration and fragmentation as a result of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and aifm1 and parp cleavage . overexpression of s1 spike protein of pedv sm98 strain effectively induced host cell apoptosis , while the expression of the other non - structure proteins ( nsp1 - 16 ) and structural proteins ( m , n , e , s2 and orf3 ) has no or less effect on cell apoptosis . similarly , expression of s1 protein from wild - type strain bj2011 or cell - adapted strain cv777 , also induce apoptosis in transfected cells . finally , we demonstrated that the s1 proteins from various coronavirus family members such as tgev , ibv , ccov , sars and mers could also induce vero - e6 cells apoptosis . conclusion : s1 spike protein is one of the most critical functional proteins that contribute to cell apoptosis . expression of s1 proteins of the coronavirus tested in this study could all induce cell apoptosis suggesting s1 maybe is an effective inducer in coronavirus - induced cell apoptosis and targeting s1 protein expression probably is a promising strategy to inhibit coronavirus infection and thus mediated apoptosis on host cells . 
c86dde4e07e6c295d41960bdde42d9196918a2dd	scientific conferences provide valuable opportunities for researchers across career stages and disciplines to present their latest work and to network with their peers . the advent of the internet has opened new possibilities for interaction , collaboration and networking , yet the uptake of tools enabling remote participation at scientific meetings has been slow . academic conferences have become more international with high proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees , but the format and quality of their organization lags behind what is possible . as a result , the experience of attending conferences in many disciplines today is not appreciably different in many respects . a few conferences in some disciplines have recently implemented valuable changes for the community and have become more receptive to attendees with families . many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity , inclusivity , promoting early career researcher ( ecr ) networking and career development , venue accessibility , and more importantly , reducing the meetings ' carbon footprint . these issues are openly visible and to some extent discussed among researchers on social media . it is important to accelerate and mandate these efforts so that researchers in all disciplines , in particular ecrs , consistently benefit from scientific gatherings , for years to come . we examined the current state of over 260 national and international academic meetings in various disciplines for features of inclusivity and sustainability and propose solutions to make conferences more modern , effective , equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet .

c8f9c1b066f06fcad8d6257e136a4a27e45ae858	successful conservation plans are not solely achieved by acquiring optimally designed reserves . ongoing monitoring and management of the biodiversity in those reserves is an equally important , but often neglected or poorly executed , part of the conservation process . in this paper we address one of the first and most important steps in designing a monitoring program -deciding what to monitor . we present a strategy for prioritizing species for monitoring and management in multispecies conservation plans . we use existing assessments of threatened status , and the degree and spatial and temporal extent of known threats to link the prioritization of species to the overarching goals and objectives of the conservation plan . we consider both broad and localized spatial scales to capture the regional conservation context and the practicalities of local management and monitoring constraints . spatial scales that are commensurate with available data are selected . we demonstrate the utility of this strategy through application to a set of 85 plants and animals in an established multispecies conservation plan in san diego county , california , usa . we use the prioritization to identify the most prominent risk factors and the habitats associated with the most threats to species . the protocol highlighted priorities that had not previously been identified and were not necessarily intuitive without systematic application of the criteria ; many high - priority species have received no monitoring attention to date , and lower - priority species have . we recommend that in the absence of clear focal species , monitoring threats in highly impacted habitats may be a way to circumvent the need to monitor all the targeted species .

cbada6c16e74f3dda02b4572f30520e733972c1d	porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) has been responsible for several recent outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea ( ped ) and has caused great economic loss in the swine - raising industry . considering the significance of pedv , a systemic analysis was performed to study its codon usage patterns . the relative synonymous codon usage value of each codon revealed that codon usage bias exists and that pedv tends to use codons that end in t. the mean enc value of 47.91 indicates that the codon usage bias is low . however , we still wanted to identify the cause of this codon usage bias . a correlation analysis between the codon compositions ( a3s , t3s , g3s , c3s , and gc3s ) , the enc values , and the nucleotide contents ( a% , t% , g% , c% , and gc% ) indicated that mutational bias plays role in shaping the pedv codon usage bias . this was further confirmed by a principal component analysis between the codon compositions and the axis values . using the gravy , aroma , and cai values , a role of natural selection in the pedv codon usage pattern was also identified . neutral analysis indicated that natural selection pressure plays a more important role than mutational bias in codon usage bias . natural selection also plays an increasingly significant role during pedv evolution . additionally , gene function and geographic distribution also influence the codon usage bias to a degree .

ce7ff7a79e44b02a63df2cb0beed9046f7acde10	multi - criteria decision - making methods are tools that facilitate and help to make better and more responsible decisions . their main objective is usually to establish a ranking of alternatives , where the best solution is in the first place and the worst in the last place . however , using different techniques to solve the same decisional problem may result in rankings that are not the same . how can we test their similarity ? for this purpose , scientists most often use different correlation measures , which unfortunately do not fully meet their objective . in this paper , we identify the shortcomings of currently used coefficients to measure the similarity of two rankings in decision - making problems . afterward , we present a new coefficient that is much better suited to compare the reference ranking and the tested rankings . in our proposal , positions at the top of the ranking have a more significant impact on the similarity than those further away , which is right in the decisionmaking domain . finally , we show a set of numerical examples , where this new coefficient is presented as an efficient tool to compare rankings in the decision - making field . ( mcda ) methods and decision support systems enjoy deep interest both in the world of business and science . almost in every case , a reliable decision requires the analysis of many alternatives . each of them should be assessed from the perspective of all the criteria characterizing its acceptability . as the complexity of the problem increases , it becomes more and more challenging to make the optimal decision . an additional complication is that there is no complete mathematical form depending on the criteria and the expected consequences . in particularly important problems , the role of the decision - maker is entrusted to an expert in a given field or to a group of experts who will help to identify the best solution . we talk about individual or group decision making , respectively . even then , it can often be problematic for an individual expert as well as for collegiate bodies to determine the right decision . in this case , mcda methods can be helpful . mcda methods are great tools to support the decision - maker in the decisionmaking process . we can identify two main groups of mcda methods , i.e. , american and european schools [ 33 ] . methods of the american school of decision support are based on the utility or value function [ 5,16 ] . the most important methods belonging to this family are : analytic hierarchy process ( ahp ) [ 34 ] , analytic network process ( anp ) [ 35 ] , utility theory additive ( uta ) [ 21 ] , simple multi - attribute rating technique ( smart ) [ 28 ] , technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution ( topsis ) [ 3,32 ] , or measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique ( macbeth ) [ 2 ] . methods of european school of decision support use outranking relation in the preference aggregation process , where the most popular are electre family [ 1,36 ] and promethee methods [ 8,15 ] . additionally , we can indicate the set of techniques based strictly on the rules of decision making . these methods use the fuzzy sets theory ( comet ) [ 12,25 - 27 ] and the rough set theory ( drsa ) [ 29 ] . generally , mcda methods help to create a ranking of decision variants where the most preferred alternative comes first [ 4 ] . the problem arises when we use more than one mcda method , and the rankings obtained are not identical . then the question arises on how to compare the received rankings ? currently , the most popular approach is the analysis based on the correlation between the two or more rankings [ 7 , 12 , 19 , 24 ] . however , we are going to show that this analysis is insufficient in the decision support domain . an appropriate approach should ensure that a better ranking in terms of the order can be identified . then , with a proper benchmark , it would be possible to assess the correctness of the mcda methods in terms of the rankings generated [ 22 ] . in this paper , we identify the shortcomings of currently used coefficients to measure the similarity of two rankings . the most significant contribution is the ws coefficient , which depends strictly on the position on which the difference in the ranking occurred . afterward , three linguistic terms are identified by using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers , i.e. , low , medium , and high similarity . we compare the proposed coefficient with ρ spearman , τ kendall , and γ goodman - kruskal coefficients , which are commonly used to measure rankings similarity in mcda problems [ 9 , 12 , 17 , 18 , 23 ] . in addition , the proposed approach is compared with 
ce9bb578da4c90de5ff42521070445a83f4a01f0	since late 2019 the world is facing the rapid spreading of a novel viral disease ( sars - cov-2 ) provoked by the coronavirus 2 infection ( covid-19 ) , declared pandemic last 12 march 2020 . as of 27 march 2020 , there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths worldwide . in those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care , this demand has over - saturate the medical facilities and , in turn , rise the mortality rate .

cfb06153bd9db651c6c7c268aecf6e65113fe008	background : coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus ( scov ) and mouse hepatitis virus a59 ( mhv - a59 ) have evolved strategies to disable the innate immune system for productive replication and spread of infection . we have previously shown that papain - like protease domain 2 ( plp2 ) , a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 ( nsp3 ) of mhv - a59 , encodes a deubiquitinase ( dub ) and inactivates ifn regulatory factor 3 ( irf3 ) thereby the type i interferon ( ifn ) response . principal findings : here we provide further evidence that plp2 may also target tank - binding kinase-1 ( tbk1 ) , the upstream kinase of irf3 in the ifn signaling pathway . overexpression experiments showed that plp2 deubiquitinated tbk1 and reduced its kinase activity , hence inhibited ifn - b reporter activity . albeit promiscuous in deubiquitinating cellular proteins , plp2 inactivated tbk1 and ifn - b response in tnf receptor associated factor 3 ( traf3 ) deficient cells , suggesting that targeting tbk1 would be sufficient for plp2 to inhibit irf3 activation . this notion was further supported by in vitro kinase assays , in which prior treatment of tbk1 with plp2 inhibited its kinase activity to phosphorylate irf3 . intriguing enough , results of plp2 overexpression system and mhv - a59 infection system proved that plp2 formed an inactive complex with tbk1 and irf3 in the cytoplasm and the presence of plp2 stabilized the hypo - phosphorylated irf3-tbk1 complex in a dose - dependent manner . conclusions : these results suggest that plp2 not only inactivates tbk1 , but also prevents irf3 nuclear translocation hence inhibits ifn transcription activation . identification of the conserved dub activity of plp2 in suppression of ifn signaling would provide a useful clue to the development of therapeutics against coronaviruses infection . 
cfffac30aa716974333312a44475097d94c8f475	simply by repetition , medical facts can become enshrined as truth even when there is little empirical evidence supporting them . we present an intuitive and clear visual design for tracking the citation history of a particular scientific fact over time . we apply this method to data from a previously published literature review on the incubation period of nine respiratory viral infections . the resulting citation networks reveal that the conventional wisdom about the incubation period for these diseases was based on a small fraction of available data and in one case , on no retrievable empirical evidence . overall , 50 % of all incubation period statements did not provide a source for their estimate and 65 % of original sources for incubation period data were not incorporated into subsequent publications . more standardized and widely available methods for visualizing these histories of medical evidence are needed to ensure that conventional wisdom can not stray too far from empirically supported knowledge . 
d0620683a194e739baca5c13917899ad7e5b2337	identification and discovery of viruses using next - generation sequencing technology is a fastdeveloping area with potential wide application in clinical diagnostics , public health monitoring and novel virus discovery . however , tremendous sequence data from ngs study has posed great challenge both in accuracy and velocity for application of ngs study . here we describe vip ( " virus identification pipeline " ) , a one - touch computational pipeline for virus identification and discovery from metagenomic ngs data . vip performs the following steps to achieve its goal : ( i ) map and filter out background - related reads , ( ii ) extensive classification of reads on the basis of nucleotide and remote amino acid homology , ( iii ) multiple k - mer based de novo assembly and phylogenetic analysis to provide evolutionary insight . we validated the feasibility and veracity of this pipeline with sequencing results of various types of clinical samples and public datasets . vip has also contributed to timely virus diagnosis ( ~10 min ) in acutely ill patients , demonstrating its potential in the performance of unbiased ngs - based clinical studies with demand of short turnaround time . vip is released under gplv3 and is available for free download at : https://github.com/keylabivdc/vip . the world contains a high diversity of human viral pathogens . there are approximately 300 recognized viral pathogen species , and additional species continue to be discovered . the identification of viral pathogens has a tremendous impact on infectious diseases , virology and public health . nearly all of the outbreaks of public health issues over the last decade have been caused by viruses , including severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) coronavirus 1 , 2009 pandemic influenza h1n1 2 , h7n9 avian influenza viruses 3 and the recently described ebola virus in west africa 4 . traditional diagnostic methods for viruses , such as cell culture , serodiagnosis , or nucleic acid - based testing are narrow in scope and require a priori knowledge of the potential infectious agents 5,6 . accurate diagnosis and timely treatment for the infection dramatically reduced the risk of continued transmission and mortality in hospitalized patients 7 . wild interest in comprehensive detection of these newly emerging and re - emerging viruses from clinical samples highlight the need for rapid , broad - spectrum diagnostic assays . shotgun metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples for viral pathogen identification provides a promising alternative solution . although metagenomics is typically applied to understanding genomic diversity from environment samples , this methodology has also revolutionized virology with comprehensive applications , including viral pathogen identification of infectious disease in clinical laboratories 8 and virus discovery in acute and chronic illnesses of unknown origin 9 . many novel viruses have been discovered using popular next generation sequencing ( ngs ) platforms such as pyrosequencing ( 454 roche ) , semiconductor sequencing ( life technology ) and illumina dye sequencing ( illumina ) 10 - 12 . achievements obtained by viral metagenomics show significant advantages over traditional methods of identifying a viral pathogen , including no need of sequence information for that pathogen , identifying multiple pathogens in a single assay and eliminating the need for time - consuming culturing or antibody laboratory tests . a key feature of latest ngs platforms is their speed . it takes minimum turnaround times about 8 hours for sequencing 13 . thus , it is critical that subsequent computational handling of the large amount of sequence

' several observations in recent years support the idea that besides the genetic background of the host and virus , the immune system seems to play a crucial role in the course of the disease . as we showed , ' the transfer of basic myelin protein ( bmp)-specific t - cell lines , generated from sde - diseased lewis rats , causes perivascular cuffing in healthy recipients , indicating autosensitization to brain antigens . presentation of autoantigens may be associated with the induction of class i1 antigens on rat astrocytes by jhm virus , as shown in in vitro studies ? because sde - diseased animals reveal a clonally very restricted jhm - specific antibody response with a low titer in the central nervous system : induction of ia antigens on astrocytes by virus particles that have escaped neutralization is likely to happen in vivo as well . from these data , we wanted to determine the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in the brain of sde - diseased lewis rats in relation to virus - infected cells and for the brain cell type infected in or around a demyelinated area revealing intense lymphocyte infiltration . by a combination of computer - aided cytophotometry and immunocytochemistry a multicolored topographic map of a representative demyelinated area in the cerebellum of an sde animal was developed , revealing the following picture : adjacent to a perivascular cuff , cytotoxic t cells distribute from the center of the focal demyelination , almost free of virus - infected cells versus the abundantly infected marginal zone . the rim of the plaque is the site where infiltrating t - helper cells are detected in close association with b lymphocytes and macrophages . however , the majority of macrophages show a strong affinity for the center of the plaque , indicating their function as a scavenger cell to eliminate cell debris . because by double immunofluorescence oligodendrocytes were shown to be a major target for jhm virus in this area , we assume that immune - mediated killing of these cells takes place . this interpretation is 663

d1fc5729ff932800c93dbe279b36ea3c53375708	chlamydophila psittaci is found worldwide , but is particularly common among psittacine birds in tropical and subtropical regions . while investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in hong kong , we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked mealy parrots , which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals . the novel adenovirus ( tentatively named psittacine adenovirus hku1 ) was most closely related to duck adenovirus a in the atadenovirus genus . sequencing showed that the psittacine adenovirus hku1 genome consists of 31,735 nucleotides . comparative genome analysis showed that the psittacine adenovirus hku1 genome contains 23 open reading frames ( orfs ) with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes , and six additional orfs at the 39 end of the genome . similar to duck adenovirus a , the novel adenovirus lacks lh1 , lh2 and lh3 , which distinguishes it from other viruses in the atadenovirus genus . notably , fiber-2 protein , which is present in aviadenovirus but not atadenovirus , is also present in psittacine adenovirus hku1 . psittacine adenovirus hku1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50.3 - 54.0 % for the dna polymerase , 64.6 - 70.7 % for the penton protein , and 66.1 - 74.0 % for the hexon protein with other atadenovirus . the c. psittaci bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung . immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots , confirming active viral replication . no other viruses were found . this is the first documentation of an adenovirus - c. psittaci co - infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis . viral - bacterial co - infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals . the role of viral - bacterial co - infection in animal - to - human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals . citation : to kkw , tse h , chan w - m , choi gky , zhang ajx , et al .

d21572371b453614216038841774cd728455fe38	a b s t r a c t infectious pancreatic necrosis virus ( ipnv ) is one of the major viral pathogens causing disease in farmed atlantic salmon worldwide . in the present work we show that several of the ipn proteins have powerful antagonistic properties against type i ifn induction in atlantic salmon . each of the five ipnv genes cloned into an expression vector were tested for the ability to influence activation of the atlantic salmon ifna1 promoter by the interferon promoter inducing protein one ( ips-1 ) or interferon regulatory factors ( irf ) . this showed that prevp2 , vp3 and vp5 inhibited activation of both promoters , while vp4 only antagonized activation of the ifna1 promoter . the viral protease vp4 was the most potent inhibitor of ifn induction , apparently targeting the irf1 and irf3 branch of the signaling cascade . vp4 antagonism is independent of its protease activity since the catalytically dead mutant vp4k674a inhibited activation of the ifna1 promoter to a similar extent as wild type vp4 . in contrast to the other ipnv proteins , the rna - dependent rna polymerase vp1 activated the ifna1 promoter . the ability to activate the ifn response was disrupted in the mutant vp1s163a , which has lost the ability to produce dsrna . vp1 also exhibited synergistic effects with irf1 and irf3 in inducing an ifna1-dependent antiviral state in cells . taken together these results suggest that ipnv has developed multiple ifn antagonistic properties to prevent ifn - induction by vp1 and its dsrna genome .

d31b2db65b2e8d40eee096d5e67185099c10c4d2	here , we found that hsv-2 does not allow induction of an autophagic response to infection , but maintains basal autophagy levels mostly unchanged during productive infection . thus , we investigated the importance of basal autophagy for hsv-2 infection , using pharmacological autophagy suppression or cells genetically deficient in an autophagy - essential gene ( atg5 ) . interference with basal autophagy flux in cells significantly reduced viral replication and diminished the infection . these results indicate that basal autophagy plays an indispensable role required for a productive infection . importantly , this study draws a sharp distinction between induced and basal autophagy , where the former acts as a viral clearance mechanism abrogating infection , while the latter supports infection . human herpesvirus-2 , also known as herpes simplex virus-2 ( hsv-2 ) , is a double - stranded dna virus that affects over 16 % of the global population aged 15 - 49 years , causing an immense epidemic 1,2 . hsv-2 primarily causes severe genital diseases associated with physical disorders ( e.g. genital ulcers and inflammation ) and psychosocial problems 3,4 . hsv-2 genital disease represents a top - alert condition due to the fact that the virus may be transmitted from mothers to neonates causing a neonatal infection with high mortality rate 5,6 and the fact that hsv-2 infection is a serious risk factor for hiv infection , enhancing hiv acquisition rate by 3 - 4 fold 7,8 . moreover , hsv-2 was also found to contribute to corneal infections and other ocular pathologies 9,10 , or may cause meningitis 3,4,11 . autophagy is a cellular catabolic pathway which degrades various cytoplasmic constituents such as misfolded proteins and protein aggregates , intracellular organelles or microbial pathogens 12,13 . during autophagy , the cargo to be degraded is recruited through autophagy receptors to the autophagic vesicles ( autophagosomes ) which eventually fuse with lysosomes , releasing their cargo that is then lysosomally degraded 12 - 14 . during conditions of nutrient deficiency , autophagy is induced to maintain energy pools in the cell , and prevent translational arrests , cell cycle delays or cell death [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . at the basal levels , autophagy plays other important homeostatic functions such as clearance of protein aggregates , and damaged organelles 12 - 14 . disruption of autophagy sometimes results in the failure to adapt to stress conditions or starvation and may cause death of the cell or organism under such conditions 15,19 . hsv-1 and hsv-2 are closely related herpesviruses that rely on icp34.5 protein as a major neurovirulence and neurotropism factor 20,21 . hsv-1 virus was shown to establish virulence via preventing launch of an autophagic response to infection , as hsv-1 icp34.5 binds to and inhibits the autophagy mediator beclin1 22 - 25 . hsv-2 icp34.5 shares some common features with hsv-1 icp34.5 and also shows differences 26 - 28 . for example , hsv-2 icp34.5 gene , contrary to hsv-1 icp34.5 , contains an intron and undergoes alternative splicing , yielding various structurally unique splice - variants 27 and protein products 28 . however , whether hsv-2 icp34.5 inhibits autophagy responses in cells , similarly to hsv-1 icp34.5 , remains to be established . very little is known about the role of autophagy in hsv-2 infection . therefore , we investigated the role of autophagy in regulating hsv-2 infection . our results demonstrate that basal autophagy , which is maintained at stable levels during productive hsv-2 infection , is required for successful hsv-2 infection , as its disruption prevented infection to a great extent . 
d38ba4f11537cfe4099d450d6f2a0371b30064ec	background : the emergence of novel respiratory viruses such as avian influenza a(h7n9 ) virus and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) highlights the importance of understanding determinants of transmission to healthcare workers ( hcws ) and the public . objectives : we aim to determine the viral content of the air emitted by symptomatic inpatients or longterm care residents with laboratory - confirmed influenza virus infection ( emitters ) , and in the breathing zones of healthcare workers who attend to them . design : a prospective pilot study of patients with laboratory - confirmed influenza virus infection was undertaken . air within 1 m of the patient was sampled using a high volume air sampler . in addition , a lower volume air sampler was placed < 1 m from the patient , with another > 1 m from the patient . viral rna was recovered from the samplers and submitted for quantitative real time pcr . in addition , personal button samplers were provided to hcws . results : the air emitted by 15 participants with laboratory - confirmed influenza virus infection was sampled . of the patients infected with influenza a , viral rna was recovered from the air emitted by 9/12 patients using the low - volume sampler ; no viral rna was detected from air emitted by patients with influenza b ( n = 3 ) . influenza virus rna was recovered from one hcw 's sampler . conclusions : patients with respiratory virus infection emit virus into the air which disperses to > 1 m and may reach the breathing zone of a hcw . this pilot study highlights the feasibility and importance of conducting a larger - scale study to identify determinants of exposure and transmission from patient to hcw . 
d3a1699f0d287bdf87132875b16c53a56a8d9d5d	the symptoms associated with covid-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever , dry cough and dyspnea . however , digestive symptoms have also been reported ; at first considered as infrequent , they in fact seem to affect ( to some extent ) more than half of patients . the symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia , diarrhea , nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain . even though prognosis is associated with lung injury , digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe covid-19 infection . digestive forms , which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms , have indeed been reported , with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign . the main biological abnormalities that can suggest covid-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia , elevated crp and heightened asat transaminases . thoraco - abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with covid-19 infection . no data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms . moreover , the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination . fecal - oral transmission of the infection is possible , especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ent level , including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms . in some doubtful cases , virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis . in the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools , a patient 's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established . upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the covid-19 epidemic , particularly among previously undetected pauci - symptomatic members of a health care staff . resumption of medico - surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement . 
d3b7f8ab557fea0fa84ef72fbc972dbf0f14dacd	partial genome characterisation of a non - cultivable marsupial adenovirus is described . adenovirus - like particles were found by electron microscopy ( em ) in the intestinal contents of brushtail possums ( trichosurus 6ulpecula ) in new zealand . using degenerate pcr primers complementary to the most conserved genome regions of adenoviruses , the complete nucleotide sequence of the penton base gene , and partial nucleotide sequences of the dna polymerase , hexon , and pvii genes were obtained . phylogenetic analysis of the penton base gene strongly suggested that the brushtail possum adenovirus ( candidate poadv-1 ) belongs to the recently proposed genus atadeno6irus . sequence analysis of the pcr products amplified from the intestinal contents of brushtail possums originating from different geographical regions of new zealand identified a single genotype . this is the first report of molecular confirmation of an adenovirus in a marsupial . 
d3c88dbf8c201937db784f9cc2263a047c2e4723	pneumonia can cause high morbidity and mortality due to the uncontrolled inflammation in the lung tissue . calming the cytokine storm may be one key to save the life of patients with severe pneumonia . here , inspired by the intrinsic affinity of platelets to the site of inflammation , we have engineered platelet - derived extracellular vesicles ( pevs ) for pneumonia - targeted drug delivery . it is demonstrated that pevs that are easily generated from the activated platelets can selectively target pneumonia in the mice model with acute lung injury ( ali ) . by loading with [ 5-(p - fluorophenyl)-2-ureido ] thiophene-3-carboxamide ( tpca-1 ) that can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors , the pevs significantly improve therapeutic benefits by inhibiting the pulmonary inflammatory cells infiltration , and calming local cytokine storm compared with the free drug - treated group . furthermore , we find that pevs could serve as a broad platform that can selectively target various inflammatory sites , including chronic atherosclerotic plaque , rheumatoid 2 arthritis and wound associated with skin .

d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	zoonotic pathogens and parasites that are transmitted from vertebrates to humans are a major public health risk with high associated global economic costs . the spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land - use changes ( luc ) such as deforestation , urbanisation , and agricultural intensification , factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources . 2 . we systematically review the literature on anthropogenic luc and zoonotic diseases , highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens , and identifying avenues for future research . 3 . the majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa . south america and asia were the most - studied regions , while the moststudied luc was urbanisation . livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification , carnivores with urbanisation and helminths , bats with deforestation and viruses , and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa . 4 . research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by luc . the behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed , impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans . understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence ( such as virulence , pathogen diversity , and ease of transmission ) . yet , many pathogens and impacts of luc other than urbanisation have been understudied . 5 . predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic luc requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread . the link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent covid-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic luc affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals . 
d46207f53f15c61125164ff5c456d0d36a23039b	ports are important infrastructures for economic growth and development . among the most significant environmental aspects of ports that contribute to the issue of climate change are those due to carbon dioxide emissions generated by port activities . given the importance of this topic , this paper gathers initiatives and methodologies that have been undertaken to calculate and reduce co 2 emissions and climate change effects in ports . after studying these methodologies , their strengths and opportunities for further enhancement have been analyzed . the results show that , in recent years , several ports have started to calculate their carbon footprint and report it . however , in some of the cases , not all the sources of ghg gases that are occurring actually in ports are taken into account , such as emissions from waste treatment operations and employees ' commuting . on other occasions , scopes are not defined following standard guidelines . furthermore , each authority or operator uses its own method to calculate co 2 emissions , which makes the comparison of results difficult . for these reasons , this paper suggests the need for creating a standardized tool to calculate carbon footprint in ports , which will make it possible to establish a benchmark and a potential comparison of results among ports .

d5bcb5d8c2edd7162e5f0fe6c189662b39eebfbe	despite high sequence similarity between pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses , there is extreme variation in host pathogenicity from one viral strain to the next . identifying the underlying mechanisms of variability in pathogenicity is a critical task for understanding influenza virus infection and effective management of highly pathogenic influenza virus disease . we applied a network - based modeling approach to identify critical functions related to influenza virus pathogenicity using large transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from mice infected with six influenza virus strains or mutants . our analysis revealed two pathogenicity - related gene expression clusters ; these results were corroborated by matching proteomics data . we also identified parallel downstream processes that were altered during influenza pathogenesis . we found that network bottlenecks ( nodes that bridge different network regions ) were highly enriched in pathogenicity - related genes , while network hubs ( highly connected network nodes ) were significantly depleted in these genes . we confirmed that this trend persisted in a distinct virus : severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars ) . the role of epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) in influenza pathogenesis , one of the bottleneck regulators with corroborating signals across transcript and protein expression data , was tested and validated in additional mouse infection experiments . we demonstrate that egfr is important during influenza infection , but the role it plays changes for lethal versus non - lethal infections . our results show that by using association networks , bottleneck genes that lack hub characteristics can be used to predict a gene 's involvement in influenza virus pathogenicity . we also demonstrate the utility of employing multiple network approaches for analyzing host response data from viral infections .

d931dcba5e7ae4361afc140d8d80920285edc264	type i interferon ( ifn ) comprises a class of cytokines first discovered more than 50 years ago and initially characterized for their ability to interfere with viral replication and restrict locally viral propagation . as such , their induction downstream of germ - line encoded pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) upon recognition of pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) is a hallmark of the host antiviral response . the acknowledgment that several pamps , not just of viral origin , may induce ifn , pinpoints at these molecules as a first line of host defense against a number of invading pathogens . acting in both autocrine and paracrine manner , ifn interferes with viral replication by inducing hundreds of different ifn - stimulated genes with both direct anti - pathogenic as well as immunomodulatory activities , therefore functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity . on the other hand an inverse interference to escape the ifn system is largely exploited by pathogens through a number of tactics and tricks aimed at evading , inhibiting or manipulating the ifn pathway , that result in progression of infection or establishment of chronic disease . in this review we discuss the interplay between the ifn system and some selected clinically important and challenging viruses and bacteria , highlighting the wide array of pathogen - triggered molecular mechanisms involved in evasion strategies . 
d93d96829d593654a258abcb1bea0851038427aa	this paper addresses the subject of movie recommendation systems , focusing on two of the most well - known filtering techniques , collaborative filtering and content - based filtering . the first approach proposes a supervised probabilistic bayesian model that forms recommendations based on the previous evaluations of other movies the user has watched . the second approach composes an unsupervised learning technique that forms clusters of users , using the k - means algorithm , based on their preference of different movie genres , as it is expressed through their ratings . both of the above approaches are compared to each other as well as to a basic method known as weighted sum , which makes predictions based on the cosine similarity and the euclidean distance between users and movies . in addition , content - based filtering is implemented through k - means clustering techniques that focus on identifying the resemblance between movie plots . the first approach clusters movies according to the tf / idf weighting scheme , applying weights to the terms of movie plots . the latter identifies the likeness between movie plots , utilizing the bm25 algorithm . the efficiency of the above methods is calculated through the accuracy metric .

da2bb5d1608eb75c739436e268af8310bd965e74	fulminant hepatic failure ( fhf ) is the severe form of hepatitis e virus infection . virus sequence analyses from severe cases have shown presence of unique and highly conserved mutations in the helicase domain of genotype 1 , 3 and 4 viruses . we evaluated role of two amino acid replacements ( l1110f ) and ( v1120i ) ; found to be frequent in genotype 1 fhf - e viruses from india . three mutant helicase proteins ( two with single point mutations and one with dual mutations ) were expressed in escherichia coli and evaluated for their atpase and rna unwinding activities . both l1110f and v1120i helicase mutants showed marginal decrease in atpase activity , while l1110f / v1120i dual mutant showed normal atpase activity . all three mutants proteins showed rna unwinding activities comparable to wild type protein . corresponding mutations were made in the helicase domain of hev rluc replicon and replication efficiencies were tested in the s10 - 3 ( huh 7 ) cells . the mutant replicon v1120i showed lower replication as compared to l1110f and l1110f / v1120i mutants . however , all three replicon mutants showed lower replication efficiencies as compared to the wild type replicon . walker a and walker b motif mutant hev replicons were unable to replicate indicating essential role of the virus encoded helicase domain during hev replication . fhf - e associated helicase mutations resulted in only marginal decrease in the virus replication suggesting alternate function / s of the helicase protein . mutations in the helicase domain of fhf - e viruses may be responsible for changing virus or host - virus protein - protein interactions , causing alterations in the host responses , eventually leading to more severe disease manifestations . 
da61ba390074e5f571e99f61cbe8f0f7bc9088d8	traditional screening for covid-19 typically includes survey questions about symptoms , travel history , and sometimes temperature measurements . we explored whether longitudinal , personal sensor data can help identify subtle changes which may indicate an infection , such as covid-19 . to do this we developed an app that collects smartwatch and activity tracker data , as well as self - reported symptoms and diagnostic testing results from participants living in the us . we assessed whether symptoms and sensor data could differentiate covid-19 positive versus negative cases in symptomatic individuals . between march 25 and june 7 , 2020 , we enrolled 30,529 participants , of whom 3,811 reported symptoms , 54 reported testing positive for covid-19 , and 279 negative . we found that a combination of symptom and sensor data resulted in an auc=0.80 [ 0.73 -0.86 ] which was significantly better ( p < 0.01 ) than a model which just considered symptoms alone ( auc=0.71 [ 0.63 -0.79 ] ) in the discrimination between symptomatic individuals positive or negative for covid-19 . such orthogonal , continuous , passively captured data may be complementary to virus testing that is generally a one - off , or infrequent , sampling assay .

da93732bae58cd4d177dab387dc3804b1eaf4e56	leukocyte migration is controlled by a membrane - based chemosensory pathway on the leading edge pseudopod that guides cell movement up attractant gradients during the innate immune and inflammatory responses . this study employed single cell and population imaging to investigate drug - induced perturbations of leading edge pseudopod morphology in cultured , polarized raw macrophages . the drugs tested included representative therapeutics ( acetylsalicylic acid , diclofenac , ibuprofen , acetaminophen ) as well as control drugs ( pdgf , gö 6976 , wortmannin ) . notably , slow addition of any of the four therapeutics to cultured macrophages , mimicking the slowly increasing plasma concentration reported for standard oral dosage in patients , yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology . this finding is consistent with the well established clinical safety of these drugs . however , rapid drug addition to cultured macrophages revealed four distinct classes of effects on the leading edge pseudopod : ( i ) non - perturbing drug exposures yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology ( acetylsalicylic acid , diclofenac ) ; ( ii ) adaptive exposures yielded temporary collapse of the extended pseudopod and its signature pi(3,4,5)p 3 lipid signal followed by slow recovery of extended pseudopod morphology ( ibuprofen , acetaminophen ) ; ( iii ) disruptive exposures yielded long - term pseudopod collapse ( gö 6976 , wortmannin ) ; and ( iv ) activating exposures yielded pseudopod expansion ( pdgf ) . the novel observation of adaptive exposures leads us to hypothesize that rapid addition of an adaptive drug overwhelms an intrinsic or extrinsic adaptation system yielding temporary collapse followed by adaptive recovery , while slow addition enables gradual adaptation to counteract the drug perturbation in real time . overall , the results illustrate an approach that may help identify therapeutic drugs that temporarily inhibit the leading edge pseudopod during extreme inflammation events , and toxic drugs that yield long term inhibition of the pseudopod with negative consequences for innate immunity . future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of drug - induced pseudopod collapse , as well as the mechanisms of adaptation and recovery following some inhibitory drug exposures .

dacb58b5ac7adedfeb44dde5632c503c5d37548f	the poxvirus life cycle , although physically autonomous from the host nucleus , is nevertheless dependent upon cellular functions . a requirement for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was implied by our previous demonstration that cerulenin , a fatty acid synthase inhibitor , impaired vaccinia virus production . here we show that additional inhibitors of this pathway , tofa and c75 , reduce viral yield significantly , with partial rescue provided by exogenous palmitate , the pathway 's endproduct . palmitate 's major role during infection is not for phospholipid synthesis or protein palmitoylation . instead , the mitochondrial import and b - oxidation of palmitate are essential , as shown by the impact of etomoxir and trimetazidine , which target these two processes respectively . moreover , the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose , which is otherwise dispensable for infection . in contrast to glucose , glutamine is essential for productive viral infection , providing intermediates that sustain the tca cycle ( anaplerosis ) . cumulatively , these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial b - oxidation of palmitate which drives the tca cycle and energy production . additionally , infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate ( atp synthesis ) that is ablated by etomoxir . the biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of tofa , c75 , or etomoxir , although the levels of viral dna and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished . however , by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis , and then monitoring virus production after release of the block , we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to tofa and c75 . electron microscopic analysis of cells released into c75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes . taken together , these data indicate that vaccinia infection , and in particular virion assembly , relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids , where their b - oxidation drives robust atp production . citation : greseth md , traktman p ( 2014 ) de novo fatty acid biosynthesis contributes significantly to establishment of a bioenergetically favorable environment for vaccinia virus infection . plos pathog 10(3 ) : e1004021 .

dbaaa5a246123fee5013bba144f693f96e624988	in a screen for rna mutagen resistance , we isolated a high fidelity rna dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) variant of coxsackie virus b3 ( cvb3 ) . curiously , this variant a372v is also resistant to amiloride . we hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity . indeed , amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of cvb3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect . we hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as mg 2 + and mn 2 + , which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting rdrp fidelity . furthermore , we show that another amiloride - resistant rdrp variant , s299 t , is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations . we show that rdrp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms : 1 ) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower basal mutation frequencies or 2 ) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations that affect polymerase fidelity . our results uncover a new antiviral approach based on mutagenesis . 
dbad2ff01d28beb2b4abb88417b2bf24c082e19d	we want to thank dr. gunasakeran and colleagues for providing further clarity on our editorial published earlier in this journal ( 1 ) . we concur that the recent regulatory framework for e - cigarettes approved by the trump administration does not go far enough . as of february 6th of this year , the sales of any flavored cartridge - based electronic nicotine delivery system ( ends ) product ( other than tobacco or menthol flavor ends ) has been banned ( 2 ) . this feeble ban does not affect the sales of e - liquid solutions and/or disposable e - cigarettes , which continue to be marketed and sold in many convenience stores around the country , enticing many of our children to become nicotine addicts longing their next dopamine release while increasing the revenues of the tobacco and e - cigarette industry . this is evidenced by the large surge in the popularity of mango flavored puff bar disposable devices , and juulcompatible puff bar mango flavored pods , in adolescent users . the " ban " also fails to address the doctoring of e - liquids by the addition of tetrahydrocannabinol , which is legal for recreational use in many states and is the fastest growing way in which adolescents are exposed to this psychoactive substance ( 3 ) . we are also particularly disappointed that the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) did not ban menthol because the fda itself has reported that menthol increases nicotine addiction and is favored by younger populations , women , and black americans ( 4 ) . since our original submission , another important piece of federal legislation was implemented . as of december 20 , 2019 , the legal age to buy tobacco products , including e - cigarettes , was raised from 18 to 21 years old ( 5 ) . however , many cities across the nation and almost 20 states had already enacted this age limit , commonly known as tobacco 21 . the fda now needs to present a plan for implementation and enforcement of this law on the national level . as we in the united states and the entire world fight the current coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) pandemic , we are concerned that a lackadaisical federal response to e - cigarettes will have significant deleterious consequences for the health of our nation . however , we continue to be hopeful knowing that , as of today , no ends products have been officially authorized by the fda , meaning that all ends products currently on the market are considered illegally marketed and are subject to enforcement at the fda 's discretion . furthermore , may 12th of this year marks the deadline for e - cigarette manufacturers to apply to the fda and submit their products for public health review . we urge the fda to carefully review these applications and regulate for the public good .

dcd7ba50d2dd32e9237d69e920ce1c4fa91f4df9	porcine deltacoronavirus ( δ - cov ) is the object of extensive research in several countries including the united states . in contrast , the epidemiology of δ - covs in wild birds in the us is largely unknown . our aim was to comparatively assess the prevalence of δand γ - covs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in arkansas , illinois , indiana , maryland , mississippi , missouri , ohio , tennessee and wisconsin . a total of 1236 cloacal / fecal swabs collected during the period 2015 - 2018 were tested for γand δ - covs using genus - specific reverse transcription - pcr assays . a total of 61 ( 4.99 % ) samples were γ - cov positive , with up to 29 positive samples per state . in contrast , only 14 samples were positive for δ - cov ( 1.14 % ) with only 1 - 4 originating from the same state . thus , unlike previous reports from asia , γ - covs are more prevalent than δ - covs in the us , suggesting that δ - covs may spread in birds with lower efficiency . this may indicate δ - cov emerging status and incomplete adaptation to new host species limiting its spread . phylogenetic analysis of the partial n gene revealed that the newly identified δ - cov strains were most closely related to the hku20 ( wigeon ) strain . further studies are necessary to investigate the role of aquatic bird δ - covs in the epidemiology of δ - covs in swine and terrestrial birds . viruses 2019 , 11 , 897 2 of 11 and mammals including pigs [ 4 ] . porcine deltacoronavirus ( pdcov ) emerged in the us in 2014 as a new enteropathogenic cov causing diarrhea , vomiting , and mortality in neonatal piglets , resulting in economic losses to the swine industry [ 4 , 5 ] . its origin is unknown , but it is hypothesized that it may have spilled over from an avian host . δ - cov and γ - cov are co - circulating in wild avian species , but their epidemiology ( prevalence and diversity ) differ [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . in a screening study of 918 wild australian birds , 141 of them tested positive for covs . after sequencing , δ - cov was detected in pacific black ducks , curlew sandpiper , red - necked stints , ruddy turnstones , and pied herons [ 6 ] . however , γ - cov ( 80 % of sequenced samples ) was identified more frequently than δ - cov ( 20 % of sequenced samples ) [ 6 ] . γ - cov was also detected in quails and pheasants in italy [ 7 ] . rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) analyses found that quail were also infected with δ - cov [ 7 ] . wild birds harbor genetically diverse δ - cov with some of them potentially transmittable to pigs [ 8 ] . a previous report from brazil showed that δ - covs were detected in two species of wild terrestrial birds , purple - breasted - parrot and plain parakeet . these avian covs were monophyletically related to covs from sparrow ( spacov hku19 ) and swine ( porcov hku15 ) , which were also found to be δ - cov. this information supports the hypothesis that δ - cov can cross inter - species barriers , with the potential to transmit from birds to swine [ 8 ] . previous studies of covs in hong kong reported three novel covs in bulbuls ( bucov hku11 ) , thrushes ( thcov hku12 ) and munias ( mucov hku13 ) , which were hypothesized to belong to the novel genus δ - cov [ 9 ] . these three novel δ - covs clustered with a δ - cov detected in asian leopard cats [ 10 ] ; however , further studies are necessary to understand interspecies transmission from birds [ 9 ] . in a surveillance study in hong kong and cambodia , δ - covs were found in different wild aquatic birds : gray herons , pond herons , great cormorants , black - faced spoonbills , and several duck species [ 11 ] . δ - covs do not cause severe illness in birds , leading to their endemic nature in the avian population [ 11 ] . in a screening study for δ - covs in china , none were found in asian leopard cats , bats , domestic cats , cattle , chickens , dogs , humans , monkeys , and rodents [ 12 ] . the investigators discovered seven novel δ - covs in pigs and wild birds ( white - eye , sparrow , magpie robin , night heron , wigeon , and common moorhen ) [ 12 ] . genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis showed that avian and swine δ - covs had similar genome characteristics and structures [ 12 ] . similarly , a recent study in the us described a novel sparrow δ - cov that clustered together with pdcov [ 13 ] and other terrestrial , but aquatic bird δ - covs . in brazil , screening revealed the presence of covs in vinaceous - breasted amazon and plain parakeet , that were closely related to δ - covs from birds ( spacov hku17 ) and swine ( porcov ) . this emphasizes the increased risk for direct interspecies transmission and that in contrast to waterfowl , terrestrial birds may act as intermediate hosts and are commonly found in the sites of bird - swine co - mingling [ 8 ] . in finland , two different avian δ - cov strains from lesser black - backed gull and black - headed gull were detected which shared 83 % and 85 % nucleotide identity with avian and mammalian δ - covs , respectively [ 14 ] . in summary , recently identified δ - covs are emerging globally that possess high genetic and antigenic plasticity . porcine δ - cov is being studied extensively in the us and elsewhere [ 4 , 5 ] . in contrast , the diversity and epidemiology of δ - covs in wild birds in the us are largely unknown . the association of porcine δ - cov with enteric disease in pigs and its continuous spread underscore an urgent need to further investigate the mechanisms of its persistence and spread . extensive epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate δ - cov prevalence in avian species , swine farms , pig - bird comingling sites and high pig - traffic sites such as abattoirs , assembly yards and truck washes . in this study , we investigated the prevalence of δand γ - covs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in arkansas , illinois , indiana , maryland , mississippi , missouri , ohio , tennessee , and wisconsin . author contributions : conceptualization , a.n.v. ;

e128ee56cee672755743295d0a33cb1b876be450	even before the 2019 novel coronavirus ( covid for short ) crisis , telemedicine ( tm ) enabled by digital health technologies was considered a key solution to the health care access problem in rural communities . however , use of tm to treat opioid use disorder ( oud ) has been limited even during the recent opioid crisis in america , despite the high rates of opioid overdose and death rates in many rural areas . this limited use of tm - based medication treatment for oud ( moud ) has been mostly attributed to restrictions imposed by federal and state regulations for tm ( eg , licensing , reimbursement ) and patient challenges ( eg , accessing and using the technology ) . the current " collision of the covid and addiction epidemics " 1 forces a drastically increased demand for remote care models for moud . we reflect on what virtual high - quality care entails and how access to these services can be expanded . the opioid crisis has hit hard in many rural communities and has brought health care access issues to the forefront in these areas . 2 opioid treatment programs that dispense methadone require frequent or daily visits which are difficult to adhere to given the long - distance travel often re - quired in these areas . primary care is at the core of rural health care systems . to expand moud access , national efforts have focused on primary care to promote officebased opioid treatment ( obot ) , which allows clinicians to provide medication such as buprenorphine or naltrexone to treat oud in their own clinical settings . nevertheless , obot uptake has been slow in rural communities , with 29.8 % of rural americans compared with 2.2 % of urban americans living in a county without a buprenorphine provider . 3 studies using retrospective chart reviews have shown that moud

driven modeling of multi - molecular assemblies . we will review here the predictive capabilities of current docking methods in blind conditions , based on the results from the most recent community - wide blind experiments . integration of template - based and ab initio docking approaches is emerging as the optimal strategy for modeling protein complexes and multimolecular assemblies . we will also review the new methodological advances on ab initio docking and integrative modeling . protein - protein interactions are key for the majority of biological functions . proteins can form highly specific transient or permanent complexes that range from binary pairs to multi - molecular assemblies , often involving other biomolecules . a detailed structural knowledge of such complexes at atomic level would improve our understanding of biological processes and facilitate intervention for biomedical and biotechnological purposes . for example , recently reported structural data on the dynamic assembly formed by the sars - cov-2 trimeric spike protein and the cell receptor ace2 are key to understand the molecular mechanisms of the virus infectivity and can be essential for the development of new vaccines and therapeutic candidates against 2 , 3 ] . however , structural data is available for only a small fraction of the protein interactome . for instance , the total number of protein - protein interactions in human is estimated to range from 130 000 [ 4 ] to 650 000 [ 5 ] , but less than 7000 of these interactions have available 3d structure ( interactome3d , 2019_1 version ) [ 6 ] . in this context , computational docking approaches aim to overcome the limited availability of experimental structural data . since the first reported protein - protein docking algorithms in the early 90 's , based on fast fourier transform ( fft ) sampling [ 7 ] , the methodological developments have mostly focused on ab initio docking of binary complexes , starting from the structure of the unbound components . some of the most popular methods are ftdock [ 8 ] , zdock [ 9 ] or molfit [ 10 ] . the method hex [ 11 ] and later frodock [ 12 ] used polar fourier correlations to accelerate docking calculations . other different approaches using stochastic search based on globalenergy optimization are icm - disco [ 13,14 ] , rosetta - dock [ 15 ] , haddock [ 16 ] , or swarmdock [ 17 ] . with the increasing availability of complex structures , in recent years attention is focused on template - based structural modeling of complexes , based the standard principles of homology - based modeling . the term template - based docking ( as opposed to ab initio docking ) is specifically used when a model is built by superimposing the structures ( or models ) of the unbound subunits onto the corresponding subunits of a template complex structure [ 18 ] . one advantage is that template - based modeling can be applied to multi - molecular complexes , not just to binary complexes as ab initio docking . in addition , it has been suggested that templates are available for the large majority of cases in which interacting subunits have structural information [ 19 ] . however , the general availability of good - quality templates that could be reliable used for template - based predictions seems much lower [ 20 ] . actually , for the majority of known interactions , only templates with remote homology are available [ 4 ] , for which direct application of template - based methods leads to poor predictions [ 21 ] . modeling multi - molecular assemblies implies additional challenges . for instance , some of the interfaces might not have available templates , in which case , we could model them by ab initio docking , in combination with restraints from evolutionary data or from available experimental information . another challenge is to identify the relevant oligomerization state of the assembly when is different from that in the template [ 22 ] , in which case , alternative orientations provided by ab initio docking can be very helpful . modeling the conformational variability of the assembly components imposes an additional difficulty . indeed , directly taking the structure of a given subunit in another context ( e.g. unbound state , different assembly or alternative oligomerization state ) might lead to inaccurate models . for this , it can be useful the application of protein - protein docking and associated procedures , such as energy scoring , minimization , or flexible refinement . we will review here the predictive capabilities of current protein - protein docking methods in blind conditions , based on the results from the most recent casp [ 23 ] and capri [ 24 ] experiments . these tests show that combination of template - based and ab initio docking approaches is emerging as the optimal strategy for modeling protein complexes and multimolecular assemblies . we will also review the most recent methodological novelties on ab initio docking , and new approaches for the inclusion of experimental information and integrative modeling . predictive capabilities of computational docking : the state - of - the - art ab initio computational docking can provide acceptable models within the top 10 predictions in up to 40 % of the cases , according to reported evaluation studies of different methodologies in current protein - protein docking benchmark version 5.0 [ 20 , 25,26 ] . traditionally casp has been focused on the prediction of the structure of individual proteins . however , very often proteins are found as oligomeric assemblies , which adds complexity to the modeling effort . to evaluate the applicability of docking methodologies for the prediction of protein oligomeric assemblies , the last three casp editions included a casp - capri joint experiment focused on multimeric assemblies , which are independently evaluated by casp and capri communities . the recent casp13-capri challenge comprised a total of 20 protein oligomeric assemblies , including 14 homocomplexes and 6 hetero - complexes , which could be classified into 15 dimers and 5 multimeric assemblies [ 23 ] . in the 9 ' easy ' targets , there were good structural templates for the ( partial or full ) assembly , while for some of the remaining 11 ' difficult ' targets , it was possible to find remote templates for part of the assembly . the availability of templates in each case is critical to explain the predictive success of the groups . focusing on the results for the top 10 predictions ( to facilitate comparison with the reported performances of different docking methods in the literature ) , the best - performing group submitted acceptable ( or better ) models for 13 targets ( 65 % of the cases ) ( figure 1 ) . in the ' easy ' targets , the best - performing group submitted acceptable models for all these cases , while in the ' difficult ' targets , the best - performing group submitted acceptable models for only 4 of such targets ( 36 % of the cases ) . regarding the quality of the models , high - quality models [ 23 ] were submitted by any group in 78 % of the ' easy ' targets ( with template ) , but only in 9 % of the ' difficult ' targets ( no template ) . on the other side , the recent 7th capri edition showed more heterogeneity in its targets , comprising 8 proteinprotein , 3 protein - peptide , and 5 protein - oligosaccharide complexes , all hetero - oligomers ( except for a homodecamer ) , which could be classified in 10 dimers and 6 multimeric assemblies [ 24 ] . the actual number of evaluated targets was 19 , because some of the interfaces in these multimeric assemblies were considered as independent targets . there were structural templates for a total of 13 target interfaces ( 6 protein - protein , 2 protein - peptide , and 5 protein - saccharide ) . this was determinant for the overall predictive success of the groups as well as for the quality of the predicted models . overall , the maximum number of target interfaces successfully predicted by a single group was 13 ( i.e. success in 68 % of the cases ) ( figure 1 ) . but in cases with no available template , the best - performing groups submitted acceptable models for only 2 target interfaces ( i.e. success in 33 % of the cases ) . regarding the quality of the models , high - quality models [ 24 ] were submitted by any group in 31 % of the ' easy ' targets ( with template ) and in 17 % of the ' difficult ' targets ( no template ) . the 7th capri edition showed that ab initio docking in cases for which there is no available template is still highly challenging , and progress is actually coming from the efficient procedures to combine template - based modeling and other docking methodologies . the casp and capri experiments show that templatebased modeling approaches are clearly the tools of choice when one can use templates of sufficient quality . however , very often only remote templates are available , which might not be good enough to provide reliable models , as above discussed [ 21 ] . in unclear situations , a relevant question is which method to choose , or how to efficiently combine these protein - protein docking approaches depending on each specific case [ 20 ] . this is even more relevant when modeling multimeric complexes , in which some interfaces might be modelled based on homologous structures , while others would need ab initio docking , as above mentioned . an updated version of the interevdock2 server [ 27 ] can perform template - based docking or ab initio docking with evolutionary constraints , depending on the case . but the question is still open about how to efficiently combine template - based and ab initio docking when reliability of the template is unclear . we can obtain some hints from the recent casp and capri experiments . 60 biophysical and computational methods current opinion in structural biology 2020 , 64:59 - 65 www.sciencedirect.com in the recent casp13-capri joint assembly prediction experiment , one of the most efficient approaches was that of fernández - recio , based on a combination of templatebased and ab initio docking followed by pydock scoring [ 23 ] , which ranked 2nd and 1st among all the capri predictors and scorers groups , respectively . models for the subunits were built by casp - hosted servers . then , ab initio docking was applied in all cases , using appropriate symmetry constraints or interface restraints from literature . additionally , when reliable templates were found , template - based models were built by superimposing all possible models of the monomers onto them . after sorting all built models by pydock scoring , the proportion of template - based and ab initio docking models in the final set of submitted models depended on the reliability of the templates ( figure 2 ) . the difference with other methodologies was more evident on the ' difficult ' cases for which no clear template was available . for instance , in t154 ab initio docking by pydock produced the only acceptable models among all participants . in t157 , pydock also produced some of the few successful models of all groups . for scorers , pydock was used to evaluate all the proposed models , and in case of reliable templates , consistency between energy - based scoring and template - based data was sought . in 7th capri , predictions using template information were in general successful . indeed , failing to use available templates , as fernández - recio did in t122 , t125 interface 1/4 , and t133 targets , led to much worse predictions ( although interestingly , this group was successful in the latter target , using only ab initio docking ) . this shows that it is critical to choose the optimal docking approach for each case , depending on the template availability . in the rest of targets , templates were used indirectly . in the two protein - peptide targets with good templates ( t134 , t135 ) , ab initio docking with pydock with restraints from the available templates was successful . in the six proteinsaccharide targets ( t126 - 130 ) , ab initio docking on the cavity identified from the available templates was also successful . these represent alternative strategies to combine ab initio docking with template information . computational approaches to docking rosell and ferná ndez -

e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	responses by resident cells are likely to play a key role in determining the severity of respiratory disease . however , sampling of the airways poses a significant challenge , particularly in infants and children . here , we report a reliable method for obtaining nasal epithelial cell rna from infants for genome - wide transcriptomic analysis , and describe baseline expression characteristics in an asymptomatic cohort . nasal epithelial cells were collected by brushing of the inferior turbinates , and gene expression was interrogated by rna - seq analysis . reliable recovery of rna occurred in the absence of adverse events . we observed high expression of epithelial cell markers and similarity to the transcriptome for intrapulmonary airway epithelial cells . we identified genes displaying low and high expression variability , both inherently , and in response to environmental exposures . the greatest gene expression differences in this asymptomatic cohort were associated with the presence of known pathogenic viruses and/or bacteria . robust bacteria - associated gene expression patterns were significantly associated with the presence of moraxella . in summary , we have developed a reliable method for interrogating the infant airway transcriptome by sampling the nasal epithelium . our data demonstrates both the fidelity and feasibility of our methodology , and describes normal gene expression and variation within a healthy infant cohort . sampling of the airway for research or diagnostic biospecimens in diseased infants is highly challenging . as compared to the tremendous progress made over the last decades in our understanding of adult lung diseases such as copd and lung fibrosis 1 - 3 , this limitation has restricted progress in identifying the molecular mechanisms contributing to pediatric respiratory diseases . many contemporary studies sample the upper airway , using aspirates of tracheal secretions in intubated subjects to collect intra - airway inflammatory cells and sloughed resident cells of the airway . the availability of these samples is limited to intubated subjects , introducing significant selection bias . furthermore , the ability of these samples to reliably capture the cellular and molecular state of the lung is unclear . other studies have analyzed nasal washings , which can be performed in a more broad population . again , these samples are of unclear relevance to the pathophysiology of the lung . brushings of nasal epithelial cells have been used for decades to diagnose primary ciliary dyskenesis ( pcd ) , indicating that recovery of epithelial cells from the nose of non - acutely ill children and infants could provide molecular information that reflects abnormalities of physiological relevance in the distal airway . furthermore , nasal brushings in adults and older pediatric patients have previously been used for interrogation of the transcriptome . these studies have generally shown that nasal brushings broadly capture gene expression with relevance to the airways 4 , and can detect disease - associated changes in gene expression 5 . we undertook the present study to determine if the recovery of nasal epithelial cells for transcriptomic analysis was feasible , and whether these data could provide molecular information of relevance to the more distal airways . we present a reliable procedure for sampling resident cells of the airway in healthy young infants , which is applicable to infants experiencing respiratory infectious disease ( t. mariani , unpublished observations ) , and likely to older ill and healthy pediatric subjects . furthermore , we provide a benchmark healthy infant nasal transcriptome ( hint ) data set , describing baseline expression and natural variation , for asymptomatic subjects . our data demonstrates that it is technically feasible to quantify genome - wide rna expression from young infant 's airways , which may be helpful in the evaluation of host responses to diseased states . subject demographics and rna - seq data generation . fifty - three healthy , full - term infants were recruited at birth . a majority of the subjects were female , predominantly caucasian , and had a mean gestational age of 39.3 ± 1.0 ( mean ± sd ) weeks , with a mean birth weight of 3.3 ± 0.4 kg ( table 1 ) . nasal brushing samples were obtained from the inferior nasal turbinate at approximately one month of age ( see methods ) . all samples were collected when infants were free of illness , specifically signs of respiratory infection or fever . rna was purified for high throughput sequence analysis from the recovered nasal cells as outlined in fig . 1 . rna yields from the nasal brushings were variable with a mean recovery of 278.5 ± 436.7 ng ( fig . 2 ) . due to variability in total rna recovery , cdna was generated from approximately 1 ng input rna . as shown in fig . 2 , the samples generated an average of 27 ± 6 million total reads , with 66 ± 14 % displaying unique mapping to the human genome . after excluding genes whose expression was not robustly and reliably detected across subjects ( see methods ) , 13,978 genes or 63 ± 7 % of the genome was transcriptionally represented in these samples . 
e58ab071997054776d058d40cd83ce1035269cde	objective to evaluate the efficacy and safety of caffeine citrate in the treatment of apnea in bronchiolitis . study design eligible infants aged # 4 months presenting to the main pediatric emergency service with apnea associated bronchiolitis were stratified by gestational age ( < 34 weeks or longer ) and randomized to receive a single dose of intravenous 25 mg / kg caffeine citrate or saline placebo . the primary efficacy outcome was a 24-hour apnea - free period beginning after completion of the blinded study drug infusion . secondary outcomes were frequency of apnea by 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after study medication , need for noninvasive / invasive ventilation , and length of stay in the hospital 's pediatric intensive care / step - down unit . results a total of 90 infants diagnosed with viral bronchiolitis associated with apnea ( median age , 38 days ) were enrolled . the rate of respiratory virus panel positivity was similar in the 2 groups ( 78 % for the placebo group vs 84 % for the caffeine group ) . the geometric mean duration to a 24-hour apnea - free period was 28.1 hours ( 95 % ci , 25.6 - 32.3 hours ) for the caffeine group and 29.1 hours ( 95 % ci , 25.7 - 32.9 hours ) for the placebo group ( p = .88 ; or , 0.99 ; 95 % ci , 0.83 - 1.17 ) . the frequency of apnea at 24 hours , 24 - 48 hours , and 48 - 72 hours after enrollment and the need for noninvasive and invasive ventilation were similar in the 2 groups . no safety issues were reported . conclusions a single dose of caffeine citrate did not significantly reduce apnea episodes associated with bronchiolitis . ( j pediatr 2016;177:204 - 11 ) . trial registration clinicaltrials.gov : nct01435486 . v iral bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants , leading to 15 hospitalizations per 1000 person - years . of these , 1.6 % to 4 % are admitted with apnea . 1 - 4 bronchiolitis - associated apnea , a subset of apnea associated with respiratory viruses , appears to be a mixed central and obstructive apnea resulting from a complex interplay of respiratory drive suppression and airway secretions driven by a hyperactive laryngochemoreflex , somnogenic cytokines , and in some cases by virus - specific respiratory suppressant surface proteins . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] caffeine is a standard treatment for apnea of prematurity 8,9 and postextubation apnea in preterm infants , 10 and has been used to ameliorate apnea complicating bronchiolitis on the basis of case reports and observational studies . 11 - 17 caffeine increases central respiratory drive and chemoreceptor sensitivity to co 2 and improves skeletal muscle contractions , reducing diaphragm fatigue and leading to better ventilation . 18 increased metabolic demand , diuresis , tachycardia , dysrhythmias , feeding intolerance , reduced weight gain , and seizures are the reported short - term side effect of caffeine . 19 although evidence from prospective studies for caffeine used to treat apnea in bronchiolitis is lacking , the drug is commonly used in an attempt to avoid intubation and is considered a standard of care in some institutions . 11,17,20 thus , we compared blinded intravenous caffeine citrate with placebo for shortening the time to resolution of acute bronchiolitis - associated apnea . 
e599045cf32089e27d0911253390b5548fe01939	severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) is a recently discovered viral disease , characterized by fever , cough , acute fibrinous pneumonia and high infectivity . specific pathogen - free ( spf ) chickens were immunized with inactivated sars coronavirus and their eggs were harvested at regular intervals . yolk immunoglobulin ( igy ) was extracted using the water dilution method , followed by further purification on a sephadex g-75 column . sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) , western blot and neutralization test results showed that the igy obtained was of a high purity and had a strong reactive activity with a neutralization titer of 1:640 . lyophilization and stability tests showed that lyophilized anti - sars coronavirus igy had promising physical properties , with no significant reduction in reactive activity and good thermal stability . all these data suggest that the anti - sars coronavirus igy could be a new useful biological product for specific antiviral therapy against sars .

e79e1ca39f35850879540728a90d38ffe36ddb04	it is more than 50 years since the lysosome was discovered . since then its hydrolytic machinery , including proteases and other hydrolases , has been fairly well identified and characterized . among these are the cysteine cathepsins , members of the family of papain - like cysteine proteases . they have unique reactive - site properties and an uneven tissue - specific expression pattern . in living organisms their activity is a delicate balance of expression , targeting , zymogen activation , inhibition by protein inhibitors and degradation . the specificity of their substrate binding sites , small - molecule inhibitor repertoire and crystal structures are providing new tools for research and development . their unique reactive - site properties have made it possible to confine the targets simply by the use of appropriate reactive groups . the epoxysuccinyls still dominate the field , but now nitriles seem to be the most appropriate " warhead " . the view of cysteine cathepsins as lysosomal proteases is changing as there is now clear evidence of their localization in other cellular compartments . besides being involved in protein turnover , they build an important part of the endosomal antigen presentation . together with the growing number of non - endosomal roles of cysteine cathepsins is growing also the knowledge of their involvement in diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis , among others . finally , cysteine cathepsins are important regulators and signaling molecules of an unimaginable number of biological processes . the current challenge is to identify their endogenous substrates , in order to gain an insight into the mechanisms of substrate degradation and processing . in this review , some of the remarkable advances that have taken place in the past decade are presented . this article is part of a special issue entitled : proteolysis 50 years after the discovery of lysosome . 
e7b32033fd060e6a1a231c22558cca24c83a67c5	read with great attention and interest the review by robba and colleagues on mechanical ventilation ( mv ) in patients with acute ischemic stroke [ 1 ] . the authors examined the pathophysiology of stroke and the risk for pulmonary complications ( brain - lung " dangerous " crosstalk , immunological response after stroke , stroke - associated pneumonia , and dysphagia ) then concluding with useful recommendations on optimal ventilator settings and therapeutic strategies . several preclinical evidence supports that mv correlates with neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction [ 2 , 3 ] . surprisingly the authors in their review cite a paper from hegeman and colleagues that challenge the hypothesis of the relationship between mv and brain inflammation state : " in the brain , mv did not induce a significant change in adhesion molecule mrna expression as compared with non - ventilated controls , [ … ] did not induce a detectable cytokine or chemokine response , [ ... ] myeloperoxidase activity was below detection level in all experimental groups " [ 4 ] . of interest , the study from klinger and colleagues reported evidence on the effect of intravenous lidocaine on the transcerebral inflammatory response during cardiac surgery [ 5 ] . in their randomized controlled clinical trial , the authors aimed to investigate the potential antineuroinflammatory effect of intravenous lidocaine and observed " a reduction in the transcerebral activation of platelet - monocyte conjugates after aortic cross - clamp release . this may be a manifestation of reduced cerebral inflammation during cardiopulmonary bypass in response to treatment with lidocaine " . to conclude , do the authors , according to the collected evidence , consider it relevant to the neuroinflammation associated with mv ? do the authors consider it worthy - in patients with acute brain damage - to establish an appropriate antiinflammatory therapy for preventing additional iatrogenic damage , for example , by taking advantage of the blunting effect of lidocaine on neuroinflammatory response ? battaglini d ; bonatti g ; robba c ; rocco prm ; pelosi p dear editor , we thank professor bilotta and colleagues for their interest in our recent scientific contribution [ 1 ] . the authors pointed out the role of neuroinflammation due to mechanical ventilation in stroke , thus advising the relevance of possible novel pharmacological strategies . first , we were asked to clarify our point of view regarding the existence of significant neuroinflammation induced by mechanical ventilation in stroke , as challenged by hegeman and colleagues [ 4 ] . we fully agree with the importance of neuroinflammation due to mechanical ventilation in stroke patients , and in our review , discussed only few of those papers referring to neuromodulation in stroke . different perspectives have been reported in the literature , which focus on the complex interaction among the neuroendocrine , neuroinflammatory , autonomic and immunologic pathways , both implicated in lung injury that can affect the brain [ 6 ] . furthermore , different neuromodulation patterns , as well as different brain - lung interactions , may occur due to mechanical ventilation or primary cerebral pathologies . second , as suggested , novel anti - inflammatory therapies for modulating the neuroinflammatory response ( such as lidocaine ) could play a role in the near future . this is another interesting issue that we did not take into consideration in our review , which focused on mechanical ventilation strategies in stroke . experimental and clinical perspectives suggest a wide range of promising therapies 
e7f5a29c5a8b04b195313b6ff79294bbb3fbb452	in this retrospective study , chest cts of 121 symptomatic patients infected with coronavirus were reviewed for common ct findings in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial ct scan ( i.e. early , 0 - 2 days ( 36 patients ) , intermediate 3 - 5 days ( 33 patients ) , late 6 - 12 days ( 25 patients ) ) . the hallmarks of covid-19 infection on imaging were bilateral and peripheral ground - glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities . notably , 20/36 ( 56 % ) of early patients had a normal ct . with a longer time after the onset of symptoms , ct findings were more frequent , including consolidation , bilateral and peripheral disease , greater total lung involvement , linear opacities , " crazy - paving " pattern and the " reverse halo " sign . bilateral lung involvement was observed in 10/36 early patients ( 28 % ) , 25/33 intermediate patients ( 76 % ) , and 22/25 late patients ( 88 % ) . 
e8afd9eeaaf3fa5e2ef88e743a971e2bab79890f	we propose two - stage adaptive pooling schemes , 2-stap and 2-stamp , for detecting covid-19 using real - time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( rt - qpcr ) test kits . similar to the tapestry scheme of ghosh et al . , the proposed schemes leverage soft information from the rt - qpcr process about the total viral load in the pool . this is in contrast to conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are boolean . the proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used dorfman 's scheme . they also provide higher testing throughput , sensitivity and specificity than the state - of - the - art non - adaptive tapestry scheme . the number of pipetting operations is lower than state - of - the - art non - adaptive pooling schemes , and is higher than that for the dorfman 's scheme . the proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non - adaptive schemes and are simple to describe . monte - carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of ghosh et al . ( tapestry ) show that 10 infected people in a population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a sensitivity of 99.50 % and specificity of 99.62 % . this is 13.5x , 4.24x , and 1.3x the testing throughput of individual testing , dorfman 's testing , and the tapestry scheme , respectively .

glucose linked transporter type 2 inhibitors ( sglt2i ) are suspected to play a role in fracture risk . the aim was to examine the relationship between haemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) or type of treatment and fractures in patients with t2dm aged ≥ 50 years . methods : 4,821 t2dm patients with documented fractures during the last 12 months from a multicentre registry ( dpv ) were compared to 349,179 t2dm patients without any documented fracture . multiple logistic regression models , adjusted for demographics , were used to determine the percentage of patients with fractures among hba1c groups ( low ( hba1c < 6.5 % ) ; intermediate ( hba1c 6.5 - 9 % ) ; high ( hba1c > 9 % ) ) and type of treatment ( insulin / gl / su vs other oral antidiabetics ( oad ) and lifestyle ) . sglt2i were compared to the oad group ( without gl/ su / sglt2i ) . these analyses were performed for the entire cohort and stratified by sex . additionally , hip fractures ( n = 1171 ) were analysed separately . results : unadjusted statistics revealed that 1.36 % of patients with t2dm had any fracture ( 0.33 % hip fracture ) . patients with fracture were more often female ( 63 % vs 47 % ) , older ( median 77.8 [ q1 ; q3 : 69.7 ; 83.8 ] vs 71.6 [ 63.2 ; 78.8 ] years ) and had longer diabetes duration ( 11.5 [ 6.6 ; 18.8 ] vs 9.2 [ 3.5 ; 15.8 ] years ) compared to patients without fractures . adjusted for demographics , women had more fractures ( 1.33 [ ci : 1.27 -1.40 ] % vs 0.80 [ 0.76 -0.85 ] % ; p < 0.01 ) and more hip fractures ( 0.23 [ 0.21 -0.26 ] % vs 0.12 [ 0.11 -0.14 ] % ; p < 0.01 ) than men . the risk for any fracture decreased with increasing hba1c ( low : 1.15 [ 1.08 -1.22 ] % ; intermediate : 0.92 [ 0.87 -0.97 ] % ; high : 0.72 [ 0.65 -0.80 ] % ; p < 0.01 ) . the same tendency was observed for hip fractures ( low : 0.19 [ 0.16 -0.22 ] % ; intermediate : 0.13 [ 0.12 -0.15 ] % ; high : 0.08 [ 0.06 -0.10 ] % ; p < 0.01 ) . analysing females and males separately , similar results were found . the comparison ( adjusted for demographics ) between treatment with insulin / gl / su ( n=207,080 ) and other oad / lifestyle ( n = 146,920 ) revealed a higher percentage of any fracture in the other oad / lifestyle group ( female : 1.53 [ 1.43 -1.64 ] % vs 1.28 [ 1.20 -1.36 ] % ; p < 0.01 ; male : 0.89 [ 0.82 -0.97 ] % vs 0.72 [ 0.67 -0.77 ] % ; p < 0.01 ) . women treated with sglt2i ( n = 1,240 ) revealed a higher proportion of any fracture ( 2.05 [ 1.36 -3.08 ] ) % compared to the other oad ( without gl / su / sglt2i ; n=26,811 ) group ( 1.25 [ 1.11 -1.41 ] % ; p = 0.02 ) . patients with low hba1c values were associated with the highest percentage for any or hip fractures . this is consistent with the hypothesis that these patients have a higher risk of hypoglycaemia . on the other side , the higher proportion of patients with fractures in the oad / lifestyle group compared to the insulin / gl / su group suggests that patients with low hba1c might have a higher fracture risk as they probably are more active . female patients have higher fracture risk if they are treated with sglt2i , which are said to be involved in bone turnover .

edf299be9be6a5616274c1c68448b880758b52f8	middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) is a major emerging zoonotic infectious disease . since its first outbreak in 2012 , the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases , causing 851 deaths . to date , there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against 2 mers - cov , increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency . a critical step in the life cycle of mers - cov is the fusion with the host cell with its spike ( s ) protein as main determinant of viral entry . proteolytic cleavage of s exposes its fusion peptide ( fp ) , which initiates membrane fusion . previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) fp have shown that calcium ( ca 2 + ) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a ca 2 + binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid ( e ) and aspartic acid ( d ) residues . sars - cov and mers - cov fp share a high sequence homology and here , we investigated whether ca 2 + is required for mers - cov fusion by substituting e and d residues in the mers - cov fp with neutrally charged alanines . upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage , we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudoparticles ( pps ) on host cells without and with ca 2 + . our results demonstrate that intracellular ca 2 + enhances mers - cov wt pps infection by approximately two - fold and that e891 is a crucial residue for ca 2 + interaction . electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to ca 2 + increasing mers - cov fp fusion - relevant membrane ordering . intriguingly , isothermal calorimetry titration showed that mers - cov fp binds one ca 2 + , as opposed to sars - cov fp which binds two . our data suggests that there are significant differences in fp - ca 2 + interactions of mers - cov and sars - cov fp despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of ca 2 + ions interacting with the fp has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus . 
ee920d9fbd665ab4530646653d2ca966f109e333	we have recently described the cloning of a portion of the hepatitis e virus ( hev ) and confirmed its etiologic association with enterically transmitted ( waterborne , epidemic ) non - a , non - b hepatitis . the virus consists of a single - stranded , positive - sense rna genome of approximately 7.5 kb , with a polyadenylated 3 ' end . we now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping , contiguous set of cdna clones representing the entire genome of the hev burma strain [ hev(b ) ] . the largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the 5 ' end and contains the rna - directed rna polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs . the second major open reading frame ( orf2 ) begins 37 bp downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 bp from the 3 ' terminal stretch of poly(a ) residues . orf2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid - like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins . a third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp . in addition to the 7.5-kb full - length genomic transcript , two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3 ' third of the genome . the genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the 5 ' end encoding nonstructural and the 3 ' end encoding the viral structural gene(s ) . the expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts . hev was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27 - 34 nm . these findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of hev suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of rna virus or perhaps a separate genus within the caliciviridae family . o tsst academic pwss , iix .

f243e05a2d51029218e0c313b20fa57c65104a62	the 2014 outbreak of ebola virus ( ebov ) in western africa highlighted the need for anti - ebov therapeutics . clomiphene is a u.s. food and drug administration ( fda)-approved drug that blocks ebov entry and infection in cells and significantly protects ebov - challenged mice . as provided , clomiphene is , approximately , a 60:40 mixture of two stereoisomers , enclomiphene and zuclomiphene . the pharmacokinetic properties of the two isomers vary , but both accumulate in the eye and male reproductive tract , tissues in which ebov can persist . here we compared the ability of clomiphene and its isomers to inhibit ebov using viral - like particle ( vlp ) entry and transcription / replication - competent vlp ( trvlp ) assays . clomiphene and its isomers inhibited the entry and infection of vlps and trvlps with similar potencies . this was demonstrated with vlps bearing the glycoproteins from three filoviruses ( ebov mayinga , ebov makona , and marburg virus ) and in two cell lines ( 293t/17 and vero e6 ) . visual problems have been noted in ebov survivors , and viral rna has been isolated from semen up to nine months post - infection . since the clomiphene isomers accumulate in these affected tissues , clomiphene or one of its isomers warrants consideration as an anti - ebov agent , for example , to potentially help ameliorate symptoms in ebov survivors . 2 of 15 basis ; these included the zmapp cocktail of monoclonal antibodies [ 7 , 8 ] , hyperimmune serum [ 9,10 ] , and several low molecular weight anti - viral drugs [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . additional therapeutic antibodies [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] have recently been described , and two novel low molecular weight viral rna polymerase inhibitors are in development [ 18 , 19 ] . a different approach has been to screen u.s. food and drug administration ( fda)-approved drugs for anti - ebov activity , with the goal of repurposing an approved drug , or combination of approved drugs , for use as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic in the advent of a future outbreak [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] . clomiphene surfaced in two independent screens of fda - approved drugs for anti - ebov activity [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] ; it blocks ebov entry and infection in tissue culture cells and provides up to 90 % protection in the mouse model of ebov disease [ 20 , 21 ] . clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used to treat female infertility due to anovulation [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] . it was also proposed in 1991 as a drug to reverse impotence in men due to low testosterone levels [ 28 ] , and is currently used off - label for men with hypogonadism . we found , however , that clomiphene exerts its anti - ebov activity in cell cultures irrespective of expression of the estrogen receptor alpha and/or beta subunits [ 20 ] . instead , clomiphene likely exerts its anti - ebov activity because it is a cationic amphiphilic drug [ 29 ] that accumulates in endolysosomes , the site of ebov fusion and cytoplasmic entry [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] . similar to other cationic amphiphilic drugs [ 29 , 33 ] , clomiphene blocks a late step in the complex process by which the ebov genome gains access to the host cell cytoplasm to initiate replication , most likely by blocking fusion between the ebov and endolysosomal membranes [ 29 ] . clomiphene citrate , the clinically - administered drug and the formulation tested to date for anti - ebov activity , is a mixture of two diastereoisomers:~60 % trans - clomiphene ( enclomiphene ) and 40 % cis - clomiphene ( zuclomiphene ) . whereas enclomiphene exhibits high anti - estrogenic properties , zuclomiphene does not [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] . the two isomers also differ in other pharmacokinetic properties . for examples , zuclomiphene has a longer half - life in serum [ 37 , 38 ] and persists in most tissues for longer periods of time than enclomiphene [ 39 ] . it could , therefore , be proposed that zuclomiphene is the major contributor to adverse side effects seen in individuals given clomiphene citrate and , conversely , that enclomiphene would impart fewer side effects [ 39 , 40 ] . due to these features , as well as its ability to raise testosterone levels , enclomiphene is currently in clinical development as a treatment for secondary hypogonadism ( low testosterone levels ) [ 41 ] . because of the differing pharmacological features of enclomiphene and zuclomiphene and the ongoing clinical development of enclomiphene , we compared the effects of clomiphene and its isomers on ebov entry and replication . we found that clomiphene , enclomiphene , zuclomiphene , and two of their primary metabolites ( 4-hydroxy - enclomiphene and 4-hydroxy - zuclomiphene ) block ebov entry and replication to similar levels . compared to clomiphene , enclomiphene , and zuclomiphene displayed similar dose profiles for blocking ebov entry and replication , as tested in two cell types and with the glycoproteins from two isolates of ebov as well as from a marburg virus .

f332bad3c29297fe115a932a096a810918691c41	in december 2019 , sars - cov-2 emerged causing the covid-19 pandemic . sars - cov , the agent responsible for the 2003 sars outbreak , utilizes ace2 and tmprss2 host molecules for viral entry . ace2 and tmprss2 have recently been implicated in sars - cov-2 viral infection . additional host molecules including adam17 , cathepsin l , cd147 , and grp78 may also function as receptors for sars - cov-2 . to determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate sars - cov-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa , we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects , gene promoter activity analysis using the fantom5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types , single cell rna sequencing ( scrnaseq ) of 10 healthy subjects , proteomic datasets , immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types , and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples . we demonstrate absent to low ace2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ace2 gene expression in both microarray and scrnaseq datasets of epithelial cell populations . consistent with gene expression , rare ace2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung , confirmed with proteomics . we present confirmatory evidence for the presence of tmprss2 , cd147 , and grp78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of cd147 and grp78 in the respiratory mucosa . collectively , our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ace2 expression in human lung , perhaps in periods of sars - cov-2 infection , and also suggest that alternate receptors for sars - cov-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection . in 2003 , the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) outbreak caused by the sars coronavirus ( cov ) resulted in 8096 probable cases with 774 confirmed deaths [ 1 , 2 ] in patients with sars , deaths were attributed to acute respiratory distress associated with diffuse bilateral pneumonia and alveolar damage [ 3 ] . in december 2019 , sars - cov-2 emerged causing the covid-19 pandemic . sars - cov-2 is spreading at a much more rapid rate than sars - cov [ 4 - 6 ] . similar clinical reports of diffuse bilateral pneumonia and alveolar damage have been reported[7 - 9 ] . severe cases of sars - cov-2 have been associated with infections of the lower respiratory tract with detection of the virus throughout this tissue as well as the upper respiratory tract[7 - 9 ] . the biological mechanisms that may govern differences in the number of sars and covid-19 cases remain undefined . it is possible that sars - cov-2 possesses distinct molecular mechanisms that impact the virulence through viral proteins , greater susceptibility of host cells to infection , permissivity of host cells to virus replication , or some combination of these and other potentially unknown factors[10 - 13 ] . understanding sars and sars - cov-2 virus similarities and differences at the molecular level in the host may provide insights into transmission , pathogenesis , and interventions . the seminal report identifying the receptor for sars - cov used a hek293 cell overexpression system to identify angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) as a receptor by coimmunoprecipitation with sars - cov spike domain 1[14 ] . subsequently , spike protein of sars - cov was identified as the viral interacting partner of ace2 . host protease activity by tmprss2 facilitates ace2 ectodomain cleavage and fusion of sars - cov membrane with host cell membrane[15 - 17 ] . adam17 has also been demonstrated to cleave ace2 ectodomain , but this was not required for sars cov infection[18 - 20 ] . mechanisms of sars cov entry distinct from ace2 have also been reported and include activation by endosomal cathepsin l and cell surface expression of cd147 or grp78[21 - 23 ] each of these receptors were mechanistically interrogated and suggest that sars cov could initiate host cell entry and infection using methods : human ethics : procurement of primary human airway epithelial cells used for immunoblots and lung tissue for immunohistochemistry was approved by hamilton integrated research ethics board ( hireb 5099 t , 5305 t , 11 - 3559 and 13 - 523-c ) . ubc research ethics office approved heart tissue archives and primary human airway epithelial cell collection . upper and lower airway gene expression analysis : public microarray experiments using affymetrix chips ( hugene-1.0-st - v1 and hg - u133 plus 2 ) on airway epithelial cell samples collected from nasal ( gse19190 ) or bronchial ( gse11906 ) brushings of healthy , non - smokers were obtained from the ncbi gene expression omnibus ( geo ) database [ 33 , 34 ] . this resulted in a total of 80 individual samples from the two different experiments which includes 11 upper airway samples ( nasal : 11 ) and 69 lower airway samples ( trachea : 17 , large airway : 17 , small airway : 35 ) . for all dataset samples , raw intensity values and annotation data were downloaded using the geoquery r package ( version 2.52.0)[35 ] from the bioconductor project [ 36 ] . probe definition files were downloaded from bioconductor and probes were annotated using bioconductor 's annotate package . all gene expression data were unified into a single dataset that was then rma - normalized , and only genes present in both of the affymetrix platforms ( n = 16,013 ) were kept for subsequent analyses . correction of experiment - specific batch effects was performed using the combat method[37 ] implemented using the sva r package ( version 3.32.1)[38 ] . rma - normalized expression levels for conventional ( ace2 , tmprss2 , adam17 , and ctsl ) and non - conventional ( cd147 , and grp78 ) sars - cov-2 receptor genes were compared across the four defined airway levels , with cdh1 expression level included as a positive control with known expression in lung tissue . gene expression levels were tested for significant differences via pairwise wilcoxon rank sum tests with benjamini - hochberg multiple testing correction using the stats r package ( version 3.6.1 ) . gene expression box plots were generated with the ggplot2 r package ( version 3.2.1 ) . analysis of curated bronchial epithelial cell brushing dataset : a total of 1,859 public microarray experiments using affymetrix chips ( hg - u133 plus 2 and hugene-1.0-st - v1 ) on airway epithelial cell samples were selected from the ncbi geo database . these samples were further filtered by removing individuals with asthma or copd , resulting in a total of 504 individual healthy samples ( gse4302 , 28 samples ; gse67472 , 43 samples ; gse37147 , 159 samples ; gse108134 , 274 samples ) . within this dataset , sex and age information was included for 310 samples with 86 females/106 males . smoking status information was also provided for 451 samples with 260 current smokers , 82 former smokers , and 109 never smokers . for all dataset samples , raw intensity values and annotation data were downloaded as described above . probe definition files were retrieved as described above . all gene expression data were unified into a single dataset that was then rma - normalized , and only genes present in both of the affymetrix platforms ( n = 16,105 ) were kept for subsequent analyses . correction of experiment - specific batch effects was performed as described above . analysis of promoter activity from the fantom5 dataset : the fantom5 promoterome dataset [ 39 ] for the hg38 assembly[40 ] was used to examine promoter activity of sars - cov-2related human genes , namely ace2 , tmprss2 , adam17 , ctsl ( cathepsin l1 ) , cd147 and grp78 . using the zenbu genome browser [ 41 ] , the nearest cap analysis of gene expression ( cage ) peak upstream and on the same strand as each of the aforementioned genes was extracted and analyzed . the dataset consists of cage promoter activity data for 1,886 primary cells , cell lines , and tissues from humans , and quantified as normalized transcripts per million ( tpm ) . a subset of fantom5 cage data ( 120 samples ) is presented considering only samples related to lung , gut , heart , and prostate tissues ( consisting of 74 , 19 , 15 , and 12 samples , respectively ) . normalized tpm values for each cage peak , an approximation for promoter activity , were log 10 transformed and separated according to tissue and cell type , and the radius of each point is proportional to these transformed normalized tpm values . analysis of protein abundance from proteomic datasets : publicly available human proteomic data from kim et al [ 31 ] and foster et al [ 32 ] datasets were used to evaluate sars - cov-2 receptor - related protein expression in different human tissues and experimental conditions . expression values were extracted from the kim et al . dataset for ace2 , tmprss2 , adam17 , ctsl ( cathepsin l1 ) , bsg ( cd147 ) , hspa5 ( grp78 ) , using cdh1 as a control for airway cells . data were created using the pheatmap package in r ( version 1.0.12 ) and expressed as log10transformed to facilitate visualization . proteomic data from the foster et al . dataset consists of bronchial epithelial cells collected from healthy , non - smokers ( n=4 ; male ) and exposed to phosphate - buffered saline control vehicle . intensity values for ace2 , tmprss2 , adam17 , cd147 , and grp78 were extracted with cdh1 included as a positive control . intensity values were determined by the original study authors via normalization of all detected peptide intensities associated with a given parent protein [ 32 ] . box plots were generated with the ggplot2 r package ( version 3.2.1 ) with intensity values log10-transformed for visualization purposes . analysis of single cell rna sequencing ( scrnaseq ) data : data preprocessed using the cell ranger pipeline ( 10x genomics ) were obtained from gse135893 . samples from 10 control subjects and 12 ipf patients were downloaded and post -

f33a7a22553031a97abde837917b4a152bbb535a	many countries have applied lockdown to suppress covid-19 , with devastating economic consequences . here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that suppress the epidemic and provide sustainable , albeit reduced , economic activity . we use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown , or similar variants that can be adapted in response to epidemiological observations , can in certain conditions suppress the epidemic while providing part - time employment . the cycle reduces the reproduction number r by a combination of reduced exposure time and a resonance effect where those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days . throughout , full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene , physical distancing and extensive testing and contact tracing . adaptive work - lockdown cycles can provide epidemic control and offer predictability to many economic sectors . 
f37b9d719084246f733cb9abf22ca7c8587d1a7c	the covid-19 epidemic was reported in the hubei province in china in december 2019 and then spread around the world reaching the pandemic stage at the beginning of march 2020 . since then , several countries went into lockdown . using a mechanistic - statistical formalism , we estimate the effect of the lockdown in france on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number r e of the covid-19 . we obtain a reduction by a factor 7 ( r e = 0.47 , 95%-ci : 0.45 - 0.50 ) , compared to the estimates carried out in france at the early stage of the epidemic . we also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of may , at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed . we find a fraction of 3.7 % ( 95%-ci : 3.0 - 4.8 % ) of the total french population , without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before april 1st , which is not known . this proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity . thus , even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave , keeping a low value of r e is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave ( initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave ) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities .

f4298dd5a7f7fc59b49989fff508a0361e461875	, are increasingly recommending the use of n95 filtering facepiece respirators ( ffrs ) in health care settings . for infection control purposes , the usual practice is to discard ffrs after close contact with a patient ( " single use " ) . however , in some situations , such as during contact with tuberculosis patients , limited ffr reuse ( i.e. , repeated donning and doffing of the same ffr by the same person ) is practiced . a related practice , extended use , involves wearing the same ffr for multiple patient encounters without doffing . extended use and limited ffr reuse have been recommended during infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics to conserve ffr supplies . this commentary examines cdc recommendations related to ffr extended use and limited reuse and analyzes available data from the literature to provide a relative estimate of the risks of these practices compared to single use . analysis of the available data and the use of disease transmission models indicate that decisions regarding whether ffr extended use or reuse should be recommended should continue to be pathogen - and event - specific . factors to be included in developing the recommendations are the potential for the pathogen to spread via contact transmission , the potential that the event could result in or is currently causing a ffr shortage , the protection provided by ffr use , human factors , potential for self - inoculation , the potential for secondary exposures , and government policies and regulations . while recent findings largely support the previous recommendations for extended use and limited reuse in certain situations , some new cautions and limitations should be considered before issuing recommendations in the future . in general , extended use of ffrs is preferred over limited ffr reuse . limited ffr reuse would allow the user a brief respite from extended wear times , but increases the risk of self - inoculation and preliminary data from one study suggest that some ffr models may begin to lose effectiveness after multiple donnings .

f4e9391c86c0d3844ce80af79bdca81f80883412	classical swine fever ( csf ) caused by the csf virus ( csfv ) is one of the most important swine diseases , resulting in huge economic losses to the pig industry worldwide . systematic vaccination is one of the most effective strategies for the prevention and control of this disease . two main csfv vaccines , the modified live vaccine ( mlv ) and the subunit e2 vaccine , are recommended . in taiwan , csf cases have not been reported since 2006 , although systemic vaccination has been practiced for 70 years . here , we examined the sero - dynamics of the piglets born from sows that received either the csfv mlv or the e2 vaccine and investigated in the field the correlation between the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( prrsv ) loads and levels of csfv antibody . a total of 1398 serum samples from 42 prrsv - positive farms were evaluated to determine the prrsv loads by real - time pcr and to detect csfv antibody levels by commercial elisa . upon comparing the two sow vaccination protocols ( csfv mlv vaccination at 4 weeks post - farrowing versus e2 vaccination at 4 - 5 weeks pre - farrowing ) , the lowest levels of csfv antibody were found in piglets at 5 - 8 and 9 - 12 weeks of age for the mlv and e2 groups , respectively . meanwhile , the appropriate time window for csfv vaccination of offspring was at 5 - 8 and 9 - 12 weeks of age in the mlv and e2 groups , respectively . there was a very highly significant negative correlation between the prrsv load and the level of csfv antibody in the csfv mlv vaccination group ( p < 0.0001 ) . the prrsv detection rate in the pigs from the mlv group ( 27.78 % ) was significantly higher than that in pigs from the e2 group ( 21.32 % ) ( p = 0.011 ) . in addition , there was a significant difference ( p = 0.019 ) in the prrsv detection rate at 5 - 8 weeks of age between the mlv ( 42.15 % ) and e2 groups ( 29.79 % ) . our findings indicate that the vaccination of csfv mlv in piglets during the prrsv susceptibility period at 5 - 8 weeks of age may be overloading the piglet 's immune system and should be a critical concern for industrial pork production in the field .

f5080088701ed43effa979603627b2a3ad53d5aa	intestinal epithelial cells ( iecs ) are constantly exposed to commensal flora and pathogen challenges . how iecs regulate their innate immune response to maintain gut homeostasis remains unclear . interferons ( ifns ) are cytokines produced during infections . while type i ifn receptors are ubiquitously expressed , type iii ifn receptors are expressed only on epithelial cells . this epithelium specificity strongly suggests exclusive functions at epithelial surfaces , but the relative roles of type i and iii ifns in the establishment of an antiviral innate immune response in human iecs are not clearly defined . here , we used mini - gut organoids to define the functions of types i and iii ifns to protect the human gut against viral infection . we show that primary non - transformed human iecs , upon viral challenge , upregulate the expression of both type i and type iii ifns at the transcriptional level but only secrete type iii ifn in the supernatant . however , human iecs respond to both type i and type iii ifns by producing ifn - stimulated genes that in turn induce an antiviral state . using genetic ablation of either type i or type iii ifn receptors , we show that either ifn can independently restrict virus infection in human iecs . importantly , we report , for the first time , differences in the mechanisms by which each ifn establishes the antiviral state . contrary to type i ifn , the antiviral activity induced by type iii ifn is strongly dependent on the mitogen - activated protein kinases signaling pathway , suggesting a pathway used by type iii ifns that non - redundantly contributes to the antiviral state . in conclusion , we demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells specifically regulate their innate immune response favoring type iii ifn - mediated signaling , which allows for efficient protection against pathogens without producing excessive inflammation . our results strongly suggest that type iii ifn constitutes the frontline of antiviral response in the human gut . we propose that mucosal surfaces , particularly the gastrointestinal tract , have evolved to favor type iii ifn - mediated response to pathogen infections as it allows for spatial segregation of signaling and moderate production of inflammatory signals which we propose are key to maintain gut homeostasis . 
f508f5a7c736788eb798ee76553b33b887882e63	type i interferons ( ifns ) are essential to the clearance of viral diseases , however , a clear distinction between genes upregulated by direct virus - cell interactions and genes upregulated by secondary ifn production has not been made . here , we investigated differential gene regulation in ferrets upon subcutaneous administration of ifn - α2b and during sars - cov infection . in vivo experiments revealed that ifn - α2b causes stat1 phosphorylation and upregulation of abundant ifn response genes ( irgs ) , chemokine receptors , and other genes that participate in phagocytosis and leukocyte transendothelial migration . during infection with sars - cov not only a variety of irgs were upregulated , but also a significantly broader range of genes involved in cell migration and inflammation . this work allowed dissection of several molecular signatures present during sars - cov which are part of a robust ifn antiviral response . these signatures can be useful markers to evaluate the status of ifn responses during a viral infection and specific features of different viruses . 
f513f58f3b0468656b956aa6067d15e744edb486	enveloped viruses exit their host cell by budding from a cellular membrane and thereby spread from one cell to another . virus budding in general involves the distortion of a cellular membrane away from the cytoplasm , envelopment of the viral capsid by one or more lipid bilayers that are enriched in viral membrane glycoproteins , and a fission event that separates the enveloped virion from the cellular membrane . while it was initially thought that virus budding is always driven by viral transmembrane proteins interacting with the inner structural proteins , it is now clear that the driving force may be different depending on the virus . research over the past years has shown that viral components specifically interact with host cell lipids and proteins , thereby adopting cellular functions and pathways to facilitate virus release . this review summarizes the current knowledge of the cellular membrane systems that serve as viral budding sites and of the viral and cellular factors involved in budding . one of the best studied cellular machineries required for virus egress is the escrt complex , which will be described in more detail .

f55260d9ea1d5664f78ee89d427effe2f76a27fc	smt - based model checkers , especially ic3-style ones , are currently the most effective techniques for verification of infinite state systems . they infer global inductive invariants via local reasoning about a single step of the transition relation of a system , while employing smtbased procedures , such as interpolation , to mitigate the limitations of local reasoning and allow for better generalization . unfortunately , these mitigations intertwine model checking with heuristics of the underlying smt - solver , negatively affecting stability of model checking . in this paper , we propose to tackle the limitations of locality in a systematic manner . we introduce explicit global guidance into the local reasoning performed by ic3-style algorithms . to this end , we extend the smt - ic3 paradigm with three novel rules , designed to mitigate fundamental sources of failure that stem from locality . we instantiate these rules for the theory of linear integer arithmetic and implement them on top of spacer solver in z3 . our empirical results show that gspacer , spacer extended with global guidance , is significantly more effective than both spacer and sole global reasoning , and , furthermore , is insensitive to interpolation .

f63f16b8f3f0922d4cb5af724af6eb06fc601e17	existed evidences show that airborne transmission of human respiratory droplets may be related with the spread of some infectious disease , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and h1n1 pandemic . non - pharmaceutical approaches , including ventilation system and personal protection , are believed to have certain positive effects on the reduction of co - occupant 's inhalation . this work then aims to numerically study the performances of mouth covering on co - occupant 's exposure under mixing ventilation ( mv ) , under - floor air distribution ( ufad ) and displacement ventilation ( dv ) system , using drift - flux model . desk partition , as one generally employed arrangement in plan office , is also investigated under mv . the dispersion of 1 , 5 and 10 μm droplet residuals are numerically calculated and co 2 is used to represent tracer gas . the results show that using mouth covering by the infected person can reduce the co - occupant 's inhalation greatly by interrupting direct spread of the expelled droplets , and best performance can be achieved under dv since the coughed air is mainly confined in the microenvironment of the infected person . the researches under mv show that the two interventions , mouth covering and desk partition , achieve almost the same inhalation for fine droplets while the inhalation of the co - occupant is lower when using mouth covering for large droplets . 
f6525bc180629aca4b0760e0ff9f187f2e2a6fec	swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus ( sads - cov ) , a newly emerging enteric coronavirus , is considered to be associated with swine acute diarrhea syndrome ( sads ) which has caused significantly economic losses to the porcine industry . interactions between sads - cov and the host innate immune response is unclear yet . in this study , we used ipec - j2 cells as a model to explore potential evasion strategies employed by sads - cov. our results showed that sads - cov infection failed to induce ifn - β production , and inhibited poly ( i : c ) and sendai virus ( sev)-triggered ifn - β expression . sads - cov also blocked poly ( i : c)-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of irf-3 and nf - κb. furthermore , sads - cov did not interfere with the activity of ifn - β promoter stimulated by irf3 , tbk1 and ikkε , but counteracted its activation induced by ips-1 and rig - i. collectively , this study is the first investigation that shows interactions between sads - cov and the host innate immunity , which provides information of the molecular mechanisms underlying sasd - cov infection . 
f6597f5e22e2d2abb997d85cdca13e656aa30372	feed has been identified as a vector of transmission for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) . the objective of this study was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize pedv cross - contamination . porcine epidemic diarrhea virus - free swine feed was manufactured to represent the negative control . a 50 kg feed batch was mixed in a pilot scale feed mill for 5 min , sampled , then discharged for 10 min into a bucket elevator and sampled again upon exit . next , a pathogenic pedv isolate was used to inoculate 49.5 kg of pedv - free feed to form the positive control . the positive control was mixed , conveyed and sampled similar to the negative control . subsequently , 4 sequence batches ( sequence 1 to 4 ) were formed by adding a 50 kg batch of pedv - negative feed to the mixer after the prior batch was mixed and conveyed ; all sequences were mixed , conveyed , and sampled similar to the negative and positive control batches . none of the equipment was cleaned between batches within a replicate . this entire process was replicated 3 times with cleaning the feed mill between replicates . feed was then analyzed for pedv rna by real - time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction ( rrt - pcr ) as measured by cycle threshold ( ct ) and for infectivity by bioassay . sequence 1 feed had higher ( p ˂ 0.05 ) rrt - pcr ct values than the positive batch and sequence 2 feed had higher ( p ˂ 0.05 ) ct values than sequence 1 , regardless of sampled location . feed sampled from the mixer from sequence 2 , 3 , and 4 was rrt - pcr negative whereas feed sampled from the bucket elevator was rrt - pcr negative from sequence 3 and 4 . bioassay was conducted using 66 mixed sex 10-d - old pigs confirmed negative for pedv allocated to 22 different rooms . pigs were initially 10-d old . control pigs remained pedv negative for the study . all pigs from the mixer positive batch ( 9/9 ) and bucket elevator positive batch ( 3/3 ) were rrt - pcr positive on fecal swabs by the end of the study . one replicate of pigs from mixer sequence 1 was rrt - pcr positive ( 3/3 ) by 7 dpi . one replicate of mixer pigs from sequence 2 was rrt - pcr positive ( 3/3 ) by 7 dpi although no detectable pedv rna was found in the feed . the results demonstrate sequenced batches had reduced quantities of pedv rna although sequenced feed without detectible pedv rna by rrt - pcr can be infectious . therefore , a sequencing protocol can reduce but not eliminate the risk of producing infectious pedv carryover from the first sequenced batch of feed .

f8ac243a6a79ed8d5f7907250ac332c24fbef0b6	hospitals worldwide are facing an increasing incidence of hard - to - treat infections . limiting infections and providing patients with optimal drug regimens require timely strain identification as well as virulence and drug - resistance profiling . additionally , prophylactic interventions based on the identification of environmental sources of recurrent infections ( e.g. , contaminated sinks ) and reconstruction of transmission chains ( i.e. , who infected whom ) could help to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections . wgs could hold the key to solving these issues . however , uptake in the clinic has been slow . some major scientific and logistical challenges need to be solved before wgs fulfils its potential in clinical microbial diagnostics . in this review we identify major bottlenecks that need to be resolved for wgs to routinely inform clinical intervention and discuss possible solutions . thanks to progress in high - throughput sequencing technologies over the last two decades , generating microbial genomes is now considered neither particularly challenging nor expensive . as a result , whole - genome sequencing ( wgs ) ( see glossary ) has been championed as the obvious and inevitable future of diagnostics in multiple reviews and opinion pieces dating back to 2010 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . despite enthusiasm in the community , wgs diagnostics has not yet been widely adopted in clinical microbiology , which may seem at odds with the current suite of applications for which wgs has huge potential , and which are already widely used in the academic literature . common applications of wgs in diagnostic microbiology include isolate characterization , antimicrobial resistance ( amr ) profiling , and establishing the sources of recurrent infections and between - patient transmissions . all of these have obvious clinical relevance and provide case studies where wgs could , in principle , provide additional information and even replace the knowledge obtained through standard clinical microbiology techniques . this review reiterates the potential of wgs for clinical microbiology , but also its current limitations , and suggests possible solutions to some of the main bottlenecks to routine implementation . in particular , we argue that applying existing wgs pipelines developed for fundamental research is unlikely to produce the fast and robust tools required , and that new dedicated approaches are needed for wgs in the clinic . at the most basic level , wgs can be used to characterize a clinical isolate , informing on the likely species and/or subtype and allowing phylogenetic placement of a given sequence relative to an existing set of isolates . wgs - based strain identification gives a far superior resolution highlights in principle , wgs can provide highly relevant information for clinical microbiology in near - real - time , from phenotype testing to tracking outbreaks . however , despite this promise , the uptake of wgs in the clinic has been limited to date , and future implementation is likely to be a slow process . the increasing information provided by wgs can cause conflict with traditional microbiological concepts and typing schemes . decreasing raw sequencing costs have not translated into decreasing total costs for bacterial genomes , which have stabilised . existing research pipelines are not suitable for the clinic , and bespoke clinical pipelines should be developed .

fbf86a73100227664edcdc981bbbccb9782602eb	bats have increasingly been recognized as the natural reservoir of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , coronavirus , and other coronaviruses found in mammals . however , little research has been conducted on bat coronaviruses in south korea . in this study , bat samples ( 332 oral swabs , 245 fecal samples , 38 urine samples , and 57 bat carcasses ) were collected at 33 natural bat habitat sites in south korea . rt - pcr and sequencing were performed for specific coronavirus genes to identify the bat coronaviruses in different bat samples . coronaviruses were detected in 2.7 % ( 18/672 ) of the samples : 13 oral swabs from one species of the family rhinolophidae , and four fecal samples and one carcass ( intestine ) from three species of the family vespertiliodae . to determine the genetic relationships of the 18 sequences obtained in this study and previously known coronaviruses , the nucleotide sequences of a 392-nt region of the rnadependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) gene were analyzed phylogenetically . thirteen sequences belonging to sars - like betacoronaviruses showed the highest nucleotide identity ( 97.1 - 99.7 % ) with bat - cov - jtmc15 reported in china . the other five sequences were most similar to mers - like betacoronaviruses . four nucleotide sequences displayed the highest identity ( 94.1 - 95.1 % ) with bat - cov - hku5 from hong kong . the one sequence from a carcass showed the highest nucleotide identity ( 99 % ) with bat - cov - sc2013 from china . these results suggest that careful surveillance of coronaviruses from bats should be continued , because animal and human infections may result from the genetic variants present in bat coronavirus reservoirs . 
fc131dc2b4872ee6c3cdd325739368c4e47e242b	hundreds of thousands of dogs are housed in kennels worldwide , yet there are no standard protocols for assessing the welfare of dogs in these environments . animal science is focusing increasingly on the importance of animal - based measures for determining welfare states , and those measures that have been used with kennelled dogs are reviewed in this paper with particular focus on their validity and practicality . from a physiological standpoint , studies using cortisol , heart rate and heart rate variability , temperature changes , and immune function are discussed . behavioural measures are also of great relevance when addressing canine welfare , thus studies on fear and anxiety behaviours , abnormal behaviours like stereotypies , as well as responses to strangers and novel objects are reviewed . finally , a limited number of studies attempting to use cognitive bias and learning ability are also mentioned as cognitive measures . the literature to date provides a strong background for which measures may be useful in determining the welfare of kennelled canines , however more research is needed to further assess the value of using these methods , particularly in regard to the large degree of individual differences that exist between dogs .

fc84e71201caa08697552bc57debc8f80135fd3f	the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) is a multifaceted lung disorder in which no specific therapeutic intervention is able to effectively improve clinical outcomes . despite an improved understanding of molecular mechanisms and advances in supportive care strategies , ards remains associated with high mortality , and survivors usually face longterm morbidity . in recent years , preclinical studies have provided mounting evidence of the potential of mesenchymal stem cell ( msc)-based therapies in lung diseases and critical illnesses . in several models of ards , mscs have been demonstrated to induce antiinflammatory and anti - apoptotic effects , improve epithelial and endothelial cell recovery , and enhance microbial and alveolar fluid clearance , thus resulting in improved lung and distal organ function and survival . early - stage clinical trials have also demonstrated the safety of msc administration in patients with ards , but further , large - scale investigations are required to assess the safety and efficacy profile of these therapies . in this review , we summarize the main mechanisms whereby mscs have been shown to exert therapeutic effects in experimental ards . we also highlight questions that need to be further elucidated and barriers that must be overcome in order to efficiently translate msc research into clinical practice .

fd19cfef82dc2fd1ee48be9b10563d681610c000	δ - crystallin is the major structural protein in avian eye lenses and is homologous to the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate lyase . this protein is structurally assembled as double dimers . lys-315 is the only residue which is arranged symmetrically at the diagonal subunit interfaces to interact with each other . this study found that wild - type protein had both dimers and monomers present in 2 - 4 m urea whilst only monomers of the k315a mutant were observed under the same conditions , as judged by sedimentation velocity analysis . the assembly of monomeric k315a mutant was reversible in contrast to wild - type protein . molecular dynamics simulations showed that the dissociation of primary dimers is prior to the diagonal dimers in wild - type protein . these results suggest the critical role of lys-315 in stabilization of the diagonal dimer structure . guanidinium hydrochloride ( gdmcl ) denatured wild - type or k315a mutant protein did not fold into functional protein . however , the urea dissociated monomers of k315a mutant protein in gdmcl were reversible folding through a multiple steps mechanism as measured by tryptophan and ans fluorescence . two partly unfolded intermediates were detected in the pathway . refolding of the intermediates resulted in a conformation with greater amounts of hydrophobic regions exposed which was prone to the formation of protein aggregates . the formation of aggregates was not prevented by the addition of α - crystallin . these results highlight that the conformational status of the monomers is critical for determining whether reversible oligomerization or aggregate formation occurs . responsible for the conversion of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate in the urea cycle . δ - crystallin and asl share about 70 % amino acid sequence identity and function as homotetramers , with four identical multi - subunit active sites [ 1 - 6 ] . δ - crystallin and asl have similar x - ray crystal structures . each monomer consists of three domains . the helices in domain 2 of each monomer associate to form a central helix bundle , comprising the core structure of the protein ( fig 1a ) [ 4,5,7 - 10 ] . the active sites of the enzyme are located in a cleft between three different monomers [ 4 ] . the quaternary structure of δ - crystallin consists of a double dimer . the contact surface between the two dimers is smaller than the interface within the primary dimer of the structure [ 11 ] . hydrogen bonding , salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions are the major forces which stabilize the quaternary structure of the protein . in the presence of guanidinium chloride ( gdmcl ) , tetrameric δ - crystallin is unfolded via a multistep pathway involving subunit dissociation into a monomeric molten globule intermediate , followed by denaturation [ 12 , 13 ] . the dimeric form is transiently detected during this unfolding / refolding process . these dimers are unstable and they are prone to self - associate into protein aggregates , and this process competes with the formation of native tetramers [ 8 ] . hence , the assembly of two dimers acts as a kinetic barrier in the refolding pathway [ 14 ] . the proper assembly of double dimers is thus important for producing a stable δ - crystallin quaternary structure . the n - terminus of δ - crystallin has been identified as being critical for the proper assembly of the double dimers [ 8 ] . in the quaternary structure , the first 25 n - terminal amino acid residues protrude into the neighboring monomer and interact with a hydrophobic cavity . when this sequence of amino acids was deleted the protein became unstable and was prone to form protein aggregates . the salt bridge formed by residues of r302 and e330 , located in the helix bundle at the dimer - dimer interface , is also important interaction for stabilization of the quaternary structure of δ - crystallin . when this interaction was disrupted by site - directed mutagenesis , the exchange rate of subunits was dramatically accelerated [ 15 ] . the interactions of e327 with both k299 and r302 and the interaction of e267 with y158 at the dimer interface were found to stabilize the quaternary structure of δ - crystallin in a cooperative manner . mutations of the residues involved in both these interactions caused the majority of dimers to dissociate , whilst only partial dissociation was observed when these interactions were individually disrupted , as judged by sedimentation velocity experiments [ 11 ] . inspection of the structure of δ - crystallin showed that the primary interactions between two symmetrically associated monomers in diagonal positions were provided by residues located at the top and bottom sides of the helical bundles ( fig 1b ) . k315 is one of the residues symmetrical located at this interface , interacting with the same residue in other monomers by hydrogen bonds ( fig 1c and 1d ) . substitution of this residue with leucine resulted in part dissociation of the quaternary structure . in contrast , the k315a mutant protein was relatively stable . this protein was unfolded into an intermediate with a stable conformation at 3 m urea [ 11 ] . this phenomenon was not observed for the k315l mutant protein , which was unfolded under the same conditions . the results lead to the hypothesis that the bulky and charged side - chain of k315 might affect the stability of the intermediate during the process of protein unfolding . when wild - type δ - crystallin was unfolded in gdmcl , the first transition for subunit dissociation resulted in a monomeric intermediate with a molten globule conformation [ 12 , 13 ] . during the refolding of 5 m gdmcl denatured δ - crystallin a marked hysteresis was observed , suggesting that the quaternary structure of that inappropriate assembled species might be related to the conformation of the refolded monomers [ 14 , 16 ] . the presence of stable intermediate during unfolding of k315a mutant protein in the presence of urea suggests that the interactions provided by this residue at the interfaces might provide an energy barrier for subunit dissociation . refolding of k315a mutant δ -

fdeaac09defec561e214a37d65df4b37b2de0c3c	results : receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve analysis demonstrated that ctni - ultra had the highest area under the curve ( auc ) at 0.855 , with a sensitivity of 67.3 % and a specificity of 88.7 % for the prediction of in - hospital mortality . patients with higher troponin i - ultra ( ctni - ultra ) , creatinine kinase - myocardial band ( ck - mb ) , and n - terminal pro - b - type natriuretic peptide ( nt - probnp ) were associated with higher mortality , compared to those who lower levels . the multivariable cox regression indicated that age ( hazard ratio ( hr ) 3.450 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.627 - 7.314 , p = 0.001 ) , coronary heart disease ( hr 1.855 , 95 % ci 1.006 - 3.421 ; p = 0.048 ) , elevated ctni - ultra ( hr 3.083 , 95 % ci 1.616 - 5.883 , p = 0.001 ) , elevated ck - mb ( hr 2.907 , 95 % ci 1.233 - 6.854 ; p = 0.015 ) , and elevated nt - probnp ( hr 5.776 , 95 % ci 2.272 - 14.682 ; p < 0.001 ) were associated with in - hospital mortality . conclusions : ctni - ultra might be the best predictor of in - hospital mortality among myocardial injury biomarkers . elevated ctni - ultra , ck - mb , and nt - probnp were independent biomarkers of the mortality in covid-19 patients . high mortality rate [ 4 , 5 ] . at present , covid-19 lacks specific and effective drugs and vaccines . therefore , it has great clinical significance to investigate risk factors of prognosis for covid-19 patients . recent studies revealed that the elevated n - terminal pro - b - type natriuretic peptide ( nt - probnp ) and elevated cardiac troponin i - ultra ( ctni - ultra ) , which are markers of myocardial injury , were significantly associated with severe disease and higher mortality [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] . huang et al . reported that most patients with elevated ctni - ultra required admission to the intensive care unit ( icu ) [ 6 ] . in a similar single - center study , of the 138 patients , 36 ( 26.1 % ) were transferred to the icu , and compared with patients who did not receive icu care , their levels of 
fdeb2a83ccf3440b32f6aeba0aa317393216c8e8	we and others have previously investigated the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) on early acute and late chronic demyelinating disease induced by theiler 's murine encephalomyelitis virus ( tmev ) . infection of susceptible sjl mice with this virus serves as an excellent model of virusinduced demyelinating disease , such as multiple sclerosis ( ms ) . inos transcripts and protein were detected in brains and spinal cords of tmevinfected sjl mice during early acute disease , which resembles polioencephalomyelitis . similar level of expression of inos has been found in resistant b6 mice , which develop only early acute disease . weak inos staining was detected in reactive astrocytes and in leptomeningeal infiltrates in tmev - infected sjl mice at 42 days post infection ( p.i . ) , corresponding to early phase of chronic demyelinating disease , but not at 66 and 180 days p.i . corresponding to advanced and terminal stages of the disease , respectively . results from other laboratories demonstrated that , blocking of no by treatment of tmev - infected sjl mice with amino guanidine ( ag ) , a specific inhibitor of no resulted in delay of late chronic demyelinating disease . however this protective effect of no inhibitor depended on the temporal phase of the disease , type of cells expressing inos and the time of administration of ag . the results from our laboratory suggests that no expressed during early acute disease is beneficial to the host through induction of apoptosis of infiltrating t cells and resolution of encephalitis , but its role in myelin / oligodendrocytes damage during late chronic demyelinating disease is not clear and it may depend on availability of superoxide and formation of peroxynitrite .

ff5a7e404a2522eab2a3d649428feaad576009de	contemporary basic research is rapidly revealing increasingly complex molecular regulatory networks which are often interconnected via key signal integrators . these connections among regulatory and catalytic networks often frustrate bioengineers as promising metabolic engineering strategies are bypassed by compensatory metabolic responses or cause unexpected , undesired outcomes such as apoptosis , product protein degradation or inappropriate post - translational modification . therefore , for metabolic engineering to achieve greater success in mammalian cell culture processes and to become important for future applications such as gene therapy and tissue engineering , this technology must be enhanced to allow simultaneous , in cases conditional , reshaping of metabolic pathways to access difficult - to - attain cell states . recent advances in this new territory of multigene metabolic engineering are intimately linked to the development of multicistronic expression technology which allows the simultaneous , and in some cases , regulated expression of several genes in mammalian cells . here we review recent achievements in multicistronic expression technology in view of multigene metabolic engineering .
