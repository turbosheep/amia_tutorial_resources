4c343dfb224188a4f09a63f7fb53a6a1c14ce213	Human Rhinoviruses (HRV) are the most common viral agents, being responsible for upper as well as lower respiratory tract infections. Evidence demonstrating that HRV disease is not exclusively limited to the upper airways and may cause lower respiratory complications, together with the frequency of HRV infections and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients underline the need for including HRV in virological diagnostics of acute lower respiratory tract illness. This article describes the development and optimization of a reverse transcription (RT) realtime PCR assay for quantification of HRV RNA in clinical samples. Efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, inter-and intraassay variability, and dynamic range have been determined. Subsequently, the assay has been validated on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens obtained from immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.

Historically, MVA was developed by serial tissue culture passage in primary chicken cells of vaccinia virus strain Ankara, and clinically used to avoid the undesirable side effects of conventional smallpox vaccination. Adapted to growth in avian cells MVA lost the ability to replicate in mammalian hosts and lacks many of the genes orthopoxviruses use to conquer their Advances in Virus Research, Volume 97 # 2017 Elsevier Inc.
f4917ba5561d79fe1548de0ea71ecd959b35c31a	Older aged adults and those with pre-existing conditions are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 associated outcomes. Using a large dataset of genome-wide RNA-seq profiles derived from human dermal fibroblasts (GSE113957) we investigated whether age affects the expression of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) genes and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Older age was associated with increased expression of PRR genes, ACE2 and four genes that encode proteins that have been shown to interact with SAR2-CoV-2 proteins. Assessment of PRR expression might provide a strategy for stratifying the risk of severe COVID-19 disease at both the individual and population levels.
b0218dd5c965f2c92348a50f46ea2e271a56c7c8	Recombination and reassortment of viral genomes are major processes contributing to the creation of new, emerging viruses. These processes are especially significant in long-term persistent infections where multiple viral genotypes co-replicate in a single host, generating abundant genotypic variants, some of which may possess novel host-colonizing and pathogenicity traits. In some plants, successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues and introduction of new genotypes of a virus by vector transmission allows for viral populations to increase in complexity for hundreds of years allowing co-replication and subsequent recombination of the multiple viral genotypes. Using a resequencing microarray, we examined a persistent infection by a Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) complex in citrus, a vegetatively propagated, globally important fruit crop, and found that the complex comprised three major and a number of minor genotypes. Subsequent deep sequencing analysis of the viral population confirmed the presence of the three major CTV genotypes and, in addition, revealed that the minor genotypes consisted of an extraordinarily large number of genetic variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes. Further analysis provided evidence that some of the recombinants underwent subsequent divergence, further increasing the genotypic complexity. These data demonstrate that persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes within a host organism is sufficient to drive the large-scale production of viral genetic variants that may evolve into new and emerging viruses.
9bb8ce021c169c4c9fcb019f4124fca57a3322b6	Umer F, Haji Z, Zafar K. Role of respirators in controlling the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) amongst dental healthcare providers: a review. International Endodontic Journal. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals are at the forefront of managing the highly infectious coronavirus. As the most common route of transmission is via aerosols and droplet inhalation, it is critical for healthcare workers to have the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, masks and goggles. Surgical masks are not effective in preventing the influenza and SARS, so they are unlikely to be able to resist contaminated aerosols from entering the respiratory system. Therefore, it is vital to use respirators which have been proven to offer better protection against droplets, aerosols and fluid penetration and which form a tight seal around the mouth and nose. Various types of respirators are used in healthcare settings, such as half-mask filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). The most commonly used FFR is the N95 disposable respirator, which is tight fitting and has a 95% or above particle filtering efficiency for a median particle size of 0.3 µm. This review discusses respirators, their purpose, types, clinical efficiency and proper donning and doffing techniques.
6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0	Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes a highly contagious and economically important disease in poultry. Viral determinants of NDV virulence are not completely understood. The amino acid sequence at the protease cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein has been postulated as a major determinant of NDV virulence. In this study, we have examined the role of F protein cleavage site sequence in NDV virulence using reverse genetics technology. The sequence G-R-Q-G-R present at the cleavage site of the F protein of avirulent strain LaSota was mutated to R-R-Q-K-R, which is present in the F cleavage site of neurovirulent strain Beaudette C (BC). The resultant mutated LaSota V.F. virus did not require exogenous protease for infectivity in cell culture, indicating that the F protein was cleaved by intracellular proteases. The virulence of the mutant and parental viruses was evaluated in vivo by intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) tests in chickens. Our results showed that the modification of the F protein cleavage site resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence from an ICPI value of 0.00 for LaSota to a value of 1.12 for LaSota V.F. However, the ICPI value of LaSota V.F. was lower than that of BC, which had a value of 1.58. Interestingly, the IVPI tests showed values of 0.00 for both LaSota and LaSota V.F. viruses, compared to the IVPI value of 1.45 of BC. In vitro characteristics of the viruses were also studied. Our results demonstrate that the efficiency of cleavage of the F protein plays an important role if the NDV is delivered directly into the brains of chicks, but there could be other viral factors that probably affect peripheral replication, viremia, or entry into the central nervous system. q
ead15e3d5220896a114a9e158ea54358273591f6	A total of 52 volunteers were recruited to take part in a dual-centered, randomized, blinded study so investigators could determine whether the level of airborne infection could be significantly reduced in patients randomly assigned to treatment with either Nasaleze ® cellulose extract alone or a combination of Nasaleze cellulose and powdered garlic extract (PGE). One puff into each nostril was recommended, and volunteers who developed an infection while traveling were told to use at least 3 puffs per nostril until symptoms were reduced. This study took place over an 8-wk period across Finland and the United Kingdom between November 2006 and March 2007. Volunteers were instructed to use a 5-point scale to assess their health and to record infectious episodes and symptoms in a daily diary. The activetreatment group (Nasaleze cellulose with PGE) experienced significantly fewer infections than the control group (20 vs 57; P<.001) and far fewer days on which an infection was obviously present (126 d in the active group vs 240 d in the control group; P<.05). Consequently, volunteers in the active group were less likely to pick up an airborne infection when PGE was added to this novel cellulose extract. Volunteers in the control group were much more likely to report more than 1 infectious episode over the treatment period or to endure longer periods of infection. The investigators concluded that the combination Nasaleze Travel formulation significantly reduced the number of airborne infections to which volunteers were exposed while traveling.
288ade468da8259eae2df0f2df5f63cdaaf09f29	For an emerging disease like COVID-19, systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response. With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. MHC tetramers were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead 'left out' to serve as a test of whether T-REX identifies biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4 + T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by ≥95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots with virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either after clearing the infection (Day 28) or samples taken prior to infection (Day 0). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.
e5146a4b1c9ae4171d885efabc99ff1cc997aeec	After the first reported case of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil, in 2015, a significant increase in the reported cases of microcephaly was observed. Microcephaly is a neurological condition in which the infant's head is significantly smaller with complications in brain development. Recently, two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM1 and IFITM3) have been shown to repress members of the flaviviridae family which includes ZIKV. However, the exact mechanisms leading to the inhibition of the virus are yet unknown. Here, we assembled an interactome of IFITM1 and IFITM3 with known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) collected from publicly available databases and novel PPIs predicted using the High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) model. We analyzed the functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins, and found that there are several immunity pathways (toll-like receptor signaling, cd28 signaling in T-helper cells, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells), neuronal pathways (axonal guidance signaling, neural tube closure and actin cytoskeleton signaling) and developmental pathways (neural tube closure, embryonic skeletal system development) that are associated with these interactors. Our novel PPIs associate cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells to microcephaly, and may also shed light on potential targets of ZIKV for host invasion by immunosuppression and cytoskeletal rearrangements. These results could help direct future research in elucidating the mechanisms underlying host defense to ZIKV and other flaviviruses. We have added a brief description about HiPPIP, the computational method that was employed to predict proteinprotein interactions.

2d0a7f8e55eaabb29119bcace9dd23e604b5a5c5	Objective Video-based depictions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be useful for educational purposes, but many of the readily available resources may worsen already stigmatized views of the procedure. Educators' common reliance on such material highlights the paucity of equipoised depictions of modern ECT well suited for the training of health professionals. The authors developed and tested a new educational module enhanced by videotaped depictions of a simulated patient undergoing the consent, treatment, recovery, and follow-up phases of ECT. Methods The didactic intervention interspersed 7 short video clips (totaling 14 min) into a 55-min lecture on treatment-resistant depression. The session, part of an intensive course of preclinical psychiatry, was delivered online through synchronous videoconferencing with Zoom. The primary outcome measure was change in the Questionnaire on Attitudes and Knowledge of ECT (QuAKE). Results Fifty-three out of 63 (87%) eligible second-year medical students completed assessments at baseline and after exposure to the didactic intervention. QuAKE scores improved between baseline and endpoint: the Attitudes composite increased from 49.4 ± 6.1 to 59.1 ± 5.7 (paired t 10.65, p < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.69), and the Knowledge composite from 13.3 ± 1.2 to 13.9 ± 0.8 (paired t 3.97, p < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.23). Conclusions These video-based educational materials proved easy to implement in the virtual classroom, were amenable to adaptation by end-use instructors, were well received by learners, and led to measurable changes in students' knowledge of and attitudes toward ECT.
428999f5e4219b4e8c82886ae77969fba9976c3c	The intestinal microbiota is essential for nutrient acquisition, immune development, and exclusion of invading pathogens. The upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiota is less well studied and does not appear to abide by many of the paradigms of the gastrointestinal tract. Decades of carriage studies in children have demonstrated that microbe-microbe competition and collusion occurs in the URT. Whether colonization with common pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) alters immune development or susceptibility to respiratory conditions is just beginning to be understood. Herein, we discuss the biogeography of the URT microbiota, the succession and evolution of the microbiota through the life course, and discuss the evidence for microbe-microbe interactions in colonization and infection.
6cd877aceddfcb8f5160d1dd3f49794779613d5b	Background: Health, as defined by the WHO, is a multidimensional concept that includes different aspects. Interest in the health conditions of the oldest-old has increased as a consequence of the phenomenon of population aging. This study investigates whether (1) it is possible to identify health profiles among the oldest-old, taking into account physical, emotional and psychological information about health, and (2) there are demographic and socioeconomic differences among the health profiles. Methods: Latent Class Analysis with covariates was applied to the Mugello Study data to identify health profiles among the 504 nonagenarians residing in the Mugello district (Tuscany, Italy) and to evaluate the association between socioeconomic characteristics and the health profiles resulting from the analysis. Results: This study highlights four groups labeled according to the posterior probability of determining a certain health characteristic: "healthy", "physically healthy with cognitive impairment", "unhealthy", and "severely unhealthy". Some demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were found to be associated with the final groups: older nonagenarians are more likely to be in worse health conditions; men are in general healthier than women; more educated individuals are less likely to be in extremely poor health conditions, while the lowest-educated are more likely to be cognitively impaired; and office or intellectual workers are less likely to be in poor health conditions than are farmers. Conclusions: Considering multiple dimensions of health to determine health profiles among the oldest-old could help to better evaluate their care needs according to their health status.
6cc9938c5a80803faa5ce3dc2855856f4c7da455	Infections by Clostridium perfringens type A are perhaps the most common causes of clostridial hemorrhagic enteritis in neonatal ruminants. Affected calves exhibit tympany, hemorrhagic abomasitis, and abomasal ulceration. Gram-positive bacilli are often found on affected mucosa and in submucosa. Aspects of etiology beyond the infecting organism are little understood, but probably include dietary issues, perhaps relating to overfeeding, feeding of barely thawed or contaminated colostrum, or conditions which effect decreased gut motility. Fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in a cloned gaur calf is illustrative of the syndrome. The calf developed pasty yellow and bloody diarrhea, and the abdomen became distended and painful. In spite of intensive therapy, the calf died 48 h after birth. At necropsy, the distended abomasum contained clotted milk and bloody fluid, and the abomasal and omasal walls were thickened and hemorrhagic. The proximal duodenum was hemorrhagic and emphysematous, and microscopic examination revealed Gram-positive rods in association with acute, necrotizing, hemorrhagic mucosal inflammation. Isolates of C. perfringens from this calf were PCR positive for cpb2, the gene encoding beta2 toxin. This finding is of unknown significance; only 14.3% (8/56) of isolates from other calves with the syndrome have been cpb2 positive, and only 50% of cpb2 positive bovine isolates express CPB2. The most prominent needs to further our understanding of this problem are consistent experimental reproduction of the disease, elucidation of virulence attributes, and development and application of prevention and control strategies. r
538d34ee99bf5a6c75bc18a2749e0aff5ce72d35	Background: Infectious diseases of livestock have negative consequences for animal production as well as animal health and welfare and can be transmitted between farms via direct (live animal movements) as well as indirect (via physical vectors such as, people, transport vehicles and fomites) contacts. The objective of the study was to examine the travel patterns of professionals visiting Swedish farms (veterinarians, milk tanker drivers, artificial inseminators, maintenance technicians and livestock hauliers). This was done by obtaining records of the farms visited by a sample of professionals in the above categories in one week in January, one week in April, one week in July and one week in October in the Swedish counties Västerbotten, Södermanland, Västergötland and Skåne. Results: There were twelve participating organisations, and data was provided for one to three individuals/vehicles/ veterinary practices per professional category and per geographic region (except for dairy service technicians and livestock hauliers who did not provide data from all regions). There was a trend towards larger areas covered and smaller number of farms visited per week in the north, but exceptions occurred and there were regional variations. Generally, the greatest areas were travelled by milk tankers and livestock hauliers, and the profession travelling over the smallest areas tended to be the veterinarians. Milk tankers visited most farms per week, one milk tanker could visit between 23 and 90 farms per week and travel over areas between 717 km 2 and 23,512 km 2 per week. Conclusions: Valuable insight into the travel patterns of Swedish professionals has emerged although the implications of the study largely concern highly infectious diseases. Movement of live animals pose the greatest risk for the spread of infectious animal diseases; however indirect contacts are important for many diseases. The results of this study indicate that in Sweden a highly contagious disease might spread over a large area in the time span of one incubation period, which ought to be kept in mind in case of an outbreak and in outbreak investigations. The difficulties in contacting some professionals visiting farms could be a problem in an outbreak situation.
a4ed1d2742c2b2498d95e049cfedc06dc81ab5db	The Coronavirus Disease pandemic is rapidly spreading across the world, representing an unparalleled challenge for health care systems. There are differences in the estimated fatality rates, which cannot be explained easily. In Italy, the estimated case fatality rate was 12.7% in mid-April, while Germany remained at 1.8%. Moreover, it is to be noted that different areas of Italy have very different lethality rates. Due to the complexity of Covid-19 patient management, it is of paramount importance to develop a well-defined clinical workflow in order to avoid the inconsistent management of patients. The Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) represents a multidisciplinary outline of anticipated care to support patient management in the Sant'Andrea Hospital, Rome. The main objective of this pilot study was to develop a new ICP evaluated by care indicators, in order to improve the COVID-19 patient management. The suggested ICP was developed by a multi-professional team composed of different specialists and administrators already involved in clinical and management processes. After a review of current internal practices and published evidences, we identified (1) the activities performed during care delivery, (2) the responsibilities for these activities, (3) hospital structural adaptation needs and potential improvements, and (4) ICP indicators.

1754ce9aafcf46c3a9097530ea786adc4516cd44	In the current era of the digital world, the hash of any digital means considered as a footprint or fingerprint of any digital term but from the ancient era, human fingerprint considered as the most trustworthy criteria for identification and it also cannot be changed with time even up to the death of an individual. In the court of law, fingerprint-proof is undeniably the most dependable and acceptable evidence to date. Fingerprint designs are exclusive in each human and the chance of two individuals having identical fingerprints is an exceptional case about one in sixty-four thousand million also the fingerprint minutiae patterns of the undistinguishable twins are different, and the ridge pattern of each fingertip remain unchanged from birth to till death. Fingerprints can be divided into basic four categories i.e. Loop, whorl, arch, and composites, nevertheless, there are more than 100 interleaved ridge and valleys physiognomies, called Galton's details, in a single rolled fingerprint. Due to the immense potential of fingerprints as an effective method of identification, the present research paper tries to investigate the problem of blood group identification and analysis of diseases those arises with aging like hypertension, type 2-diabetes and arthritis from a fingerprint by analyzing their patterns correlation with blood group and age of an individual. The work has been driven by studies of anthropometry, biometric trademark, and pattern recognition proposing that it is possible to predict blood group using fingerprint map reading. Dermatoglyphics as a diagnostic aid used from ancient eras and now it is well established in number of diseases which have strong hereditary basis and is employed as a method for screening for abnormal anomalies. Apart from its use in predicting the diagnosis of disease; dermatoglyphics is also used in forensic medicine in individual identification, physical anthropology, human genetics and medicine. However, the Machine and Deep Learning techniques, if used for fingerprint minutiae patterns to be trained by Neural Network for blood group prediction and classification of common clinical diseases arises with aging based on lifestyle would be an unusual research work.

7510d8070d411cd64b803e8f987fbca2a8f88132	Object The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally. As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. Methods Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. Results There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. Conclusion We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.
b65cd32d4a5347f1938f7d6ebb7b1f68f120522a	Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory illness in humans; the second-largest and most deadly outbreak to date occurred in Saudi Arabia. The dromedary camel is considered a possible host of the virus and also to act as a reservoir, transmitting the virus to humans. Here, we studied evolutionary relationships for 31 complete genomes of betacoronaviruses, including eight newly sequenced MERS-CoV genomes isolated from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. Through bioinformatics tools, we also used available sequences and 3D structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein to predict MERS-CoV epitopes and assess antibody binding affinity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the eight new sequences have close relationships with existing strains detected in camels and humans in Arabian Gulf countries. The 2019-nCov strain appears to have higher homology to both bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV strains. The spike protein tree exhibited clustering of MERS-CoV sequences similar to the complete genome tree, except for one sequence from Qatar (KF961222). B cell epitope analysis determined that the MERS-CoV spike protein has 24 total discontinuous regions from which just six epitopes were selected with score values of >80%. Our results suggest that the virus circulates by way of camels crossing the borders of Arabian Gulf countries. This study contributes to finding more effective vaccines in order to provide long-term protection against MERS-CoV and identifying neutralizing antibodies.
c8dc2de80f927d824a45fdf366e7b80c2eadef5a	Coronavirus disease 2019 named by the WHO as a result of the global public health emergency. COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus named as novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV). From the first case reported in December 2019 it is now a pandemic situation and a major public health emergency. The COVID-19 transmission rate is very high, infecting two to three persons on average with contact to an already infected person. There is a need for the health system, specially in developing countries such as in Pakistan, to combat such a novel disease by rapid, accurate, and high quality diagnostic testing in order to screen suspected cases and also surveillance of the disease. A rapid, accurate and low-cost diagnostic point-of-care device is needed for timely diagnosis of COVID-19 and is essential to combat such outbreaks for compelling preventive measures against the disease spread. This review is to highlight the importance of pointof-care diagnostics device for robust and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 in physician offices and other urgent healthcare-type settings and encourage academics and stake holders towards advancement in order to control outbreaks and develop the public health surveillance system. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Methodology Published papers including those articles published from PubMed, WHO global database for COVID-19, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines COVID-19 transmission webpage to clarify information about types of spread were reviewed.

85cdea7dee21476f5d1366884c5f0c5abdce3fbb	To synthesise and characterize the polyoxometalate Cs 2 K 4 Na[SiW 9 Nb 3 O 40 ]ÁH 2 O 1 for its anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) properties by using the HepG2.2.15 cell. The methylthiazol tetrazolium assay was used to evaluate the growth inhibitory effect of Compound 1 on HepG2.2.15 cell. By using ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively, the presence of extracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA were measured. The levels of intracellular HBV DNA and mRNA were determined by using Southern blot or reverse-transcription-PCR, respectively. Intracellular distribution of antigen were measured by Western blot. A 1995 lmol/L concentration of the commercially-available hepatitis B drug, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), was required to achieve 50% cytotoxicity against cultured cells (CC 50 ) by day nine; in contrast, only 1747 lmol/L of Compound 1 was required for the same result. Treatment of HepG2.2.15 cells with Compound 1 effectively suppress the secretion of HBV antigens and HBV DNA in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. IC 50 values were determined to be 80 lmol/L for HBsAg, 75 lmol/L for HBeAg and 3.72 lmol/L for supernatant HBV DNA at day nine post-exposure, as opposed to 266, 296, 30.09 lmol/L, respectively, for ADV. Intracellular HBV DNA, mRNA and antigen were also found to be decreased by Compound 1. The same dose of ADV yielded a significantly less robust inhibitory effect. Compound 1 can clear HBV from hepatic cells and may represent a therapeutic agent to treat HBV infection. Approximately 2 billion people worldwide have been infected with hepatitis B and about 350 million live with chronic infection. HBV belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family and is a non-cytopathic DNA virus that can replicate via reverse-transcription of an RNA intermediate. 1 The pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) intermediate is produced inside the cellular nucleus. Next, the pgRNA is exported to the cytoplasm, where a virally-encoded polymerase can then convert the pgRNA into minus-strand DNA; ultimately, a doublestranded, relaxed circular DNA molecule is generated. 2,3 This life cycle places HBV into the larger family of retroviruses, which are characterized by the reverse-transcription activity involving an RNA intermediate. Chronic hepatitis B patients are commonly treated with either interferon alpha (INF-a) or the nucleoside analog lamivudine (3TC), adefovir, entecavir, or telbivudine, which are all synthetic reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. 4,5 INF-a inhibits viral replication and acts as an immuno-modulator, but is limited in effectiveness (40% response rate), 6 is costly, and elicits serious, undesirable side effects. 3TC mediates a reversible inhibition event, but continuous treatment has been associated with development of drug-resistant HBV variants in up to 70% of patients after 4 years of treatment. 7 Adefovir, entecavir, and telbivudine are used when 3TC-resistant strains are detected; however, resistances to these drugs have also been reported. 8 Combination therapy, such as a nucleoside analog plus INF-a, is a promising approach that may yield additive or synergistic effects and may reduce the emergence of resistant strains. Unfortunately, the serious side effects associated with each of the agents used remain and may even be compounded. Therefore, it is critical to develop therapeutic agents with improved efficacy and minimal to no side effects. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are metal-oxide cluster anions which have applicable potential in electronics, magnetics, homogeneous and heterogeneous photo-catalysis, and in medicine where they can act as anti-tumor, -viral, and -bacterial agents. 9 Many studies have found evidence that POMs can inhibit the replication of both 0960-894X/$ -see front matter Ó Abbreviations: SI, selectivity index; IC50, the concentrations that inhibit HBV DNA replication, and HBsAg and HBeAg secretions to 50%; CC50, the concentration that achieved 50% cytotoxicity against cultured cells; ADV, adefovir dipivoxil.
11962aeafce56977113c1f8f9e6f6a55b2ef065c	Expressing proteins of interest as fusions to proteins of the bacterial envelope is a powerful technique with many biotechnological and medical applications. Autotransporters have recently emerged as a good tool for bacterial surface display. These proteins are composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a passenger domain and a translocator domain that mediates the outer membrane translocation of the passenger. The natural passenger domain of autotransporters can be replaced by heterologous proteins that become displayed at the bacterial surface by the translocator domain. The simplicity and versatility of this system has made it very attractive and it has been used to display functional enzymes, vaccine antigens as well as polypeptides libraries. The recent advances in the study of the translocation mechanism of autotransporters have raised several controversial issues with implications for their use as display systems. These issues include the requirement for the displayed polypeptides to remain in a translocation-competent state in the periplasm, the requirement for specific signal sequences and "autochaperone" domains, and the influence of the genetic background of the expression host strain. It is therefore important to better understand the mechanism of translocation of autotransporters in order to employ them to their full potential. This review will focus on the recent advances in the study of the translocation mechanism of autotransporters and describe practical considerations regarding their use for bacterial surface display.

97d810449508986d30aed0dd41a997071eec74d8	Burn infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa pose a major complication in wound healing. This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial effect of metal ions, graphene (Gr), and graphene oxide (GO), individually and in combination, against the planktonic and biofilm states of two antimicrobially resistant clinical strains of P. aeruginosa each with different antibiotic resistance profiles. Minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and fractional inhibitory concentrations were performed to determine the efficacy of the metal ions and graphene composites individually and their synergy in combination. Crystal violet biofilm and XTT assays measured the biofilm inhibition and metabolic activity, respectively. Molybdenum, platinum, tin, gold, and palladium ions exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity (MIC = 7.8-26.0 mg/L), whilst GO and Gr demonstrated moderate-to-no effect against the planktonic bacterial cells, irrespective of their antibiograms. Biofilms were inhibited by zinc, palladium, silver, and graphene. In combination, silver-graphene and molybdenum-graphene inhibited both the planktonic and biofilm forms of the bacteria making them potential candidates for development into topical antimicrobials for burns patients infected with antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa.

05e9af5c04c17b89fd8d65d62a381eb22e8316ed	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important account of infectious hepatitis and interferon (IFN) remains one of the best treatment options. Activation of type I IFN signaling pathway leads to expressions of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) which play important roles in antiviral and immunomodulatory responses to HBV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our previous studies indicated that ISG15 and its conjugation (ISGylation) were exploited by HCV to benefit its replication and persistent infection. This study was designed to assess the role of ISG15 and ISGylation in HBV infection in vitro. The levels of ISG15 and ISGylation were upregulated by ISG15 plasmid transfection into HepG2.2.15 cells. Decreased ISGylation was achieved by siRNA targeting UBE1L, the only E1 activating enzyme for ISGylation. Overexpression of ISG15 and subsequent ISGylation significantly increased the levels of HBV DNA in the culture supernatants although the intracellular viral replication remained unaffected. Silencing UBE1L, with decreased ISGylation achieved, abrogated this ISGylation-mediated promoting effect. Our data indicated that overexpression of ISG15 stimulated HBV production in an ISGylation-dependent manner. Identification of ISG15-conjugated proteins (either HBV viral or host proteins) may reveal promising candidates for further antiviral drug development.
6b67761a8689f2744b4046161187a0d128a5d7d1	Nidoviruses with large genomes (26.3-31.7 kb; 'large nidoviruses'), including Coronaviridae and Roniviridae, are the most complex positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) viruses. Based on genome size, they are far separated from all other ssRNA+ viruses (below 19.6 kb), including the distantly related Arteriviridae (12.7-15.7 kb; 'small nidoviruses'). Exceptionally for ssRNA+ viruses, large nidoviruses encode a 39-59exoribonuclease (ExoN) that was implicated in controlling RNA replication fidelity. Its acquisition may have given rise to the ancestor of large nidoviruses, a hypothesis for which we here provide evolutionary support using comparative genomics involving the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus. This Nam Dinh virus (NDiV), named after a Vietnamese province, was isolated from mosquitoes and is yet to be linked to any pathology. The genome of this enveloped 60-80 nm virus is 20,192 nt and has a nidovirus-like polycistronic organization including two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b followed by several smaller 39-proximal ORFs. Peptide sequencing assigned three virion proteins to ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3, which are expressed from two 39-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. The NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b frameshifting signal and various replicative proteins were tentatively mapped to canonical positions in the nidovirus genome. They include six nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains, as well as the ExoN and 29-O-methyltransferase that are specific to large nidoviruses. NDiV ORF1b also encodes a putative N7methyltransferase, identified in a subset of large nidoviruses, but not the uridylate-specific endonuclease that -in deviation from the current paradigm -is present exclusively in the currently known vertebrate nidoviruses. Rooted phylogenetic inference by Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods indicates that NDiV clusters with roniviruses and that its branch diverged from large nidoviruses early after they split from small nidoviruses. Together these characteristics identify NDiV as the prototype of a new nidovirus family and a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.
a6e86c94af0d5da2d07a4d4047823ba8f829dad1	To investigate a cluster of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases in a women-only dormitory in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in October 2015, we collected epidemiologic information, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and blood samples from 828 residents during November 2015 and December 2015-January 2016. We found confirmed infection for 19 (8 by reverse transcription PCR and 11 by serologic testing). Infection attack rates varied (2.7%-32.3%) by dormitory building. No deaths occurred. Independent risk factors for infection were direct contact with a confirmed case-patient and sharing a room with a confirmed case-patient; a protective factor was having an air conditioner in the bedroom. For 9 women from whom a second serum sample was collected, antibodies remained detectable at titers >1:20 by pseudoparticle neutralization tests (n = 8) and 90% plaque-reduction neutralization tests (n = 2). In closed high-contact settings, MERS coronavirus was highly infectious and pathogenicity was relatively low.
99da127b01d609b3b486e0ba7dc19912d7c3b6c1	The Korean peninsula is no stranger to disaster, experiencing natural disasters such as severe downpours, floods, and typhoons and human-caused disasters such as industrial accidents, building collapses, and infernos. Fortunately, for the purposes of learning from each event, it has well documented many aspects of each disaster, policy and law changes, institutional reforms, and future risk management alternatives. However, to take the almost 2000-year documented history of Korea in a more manageable period, we focus on the major disaster events, those that are quantifiable and that took place between 1948 and 2015 to see if the disaster trend in Korea is producing power-law distributed disasters. We specifically analyzed the statistical characteristics of these major disaster events and their functional relationship between frequency and magnitude to see if a change in one produces a proportional relative change in the other.
539ecabd72e2aa6a18c2b2566b1b5883a6643083	R61837 or 3-methoxy-6-[4-(3-methylphenyl)-l-piperazinyl]pyridazine is a new and potent inhibitor of rhinoviruses at concentrations not inhibitory to HeLa cell growth. Different rhinovirus serotypes varied widely in their susceptibility to the antiviral agent. The MICs for 50% CPE reduction ranged from 0.004 to 15 gg/ml. The yields of the most susceptible serotypes were reduced by a factor of 1,000 to 10,000 after single round high multiplicity infections in presence of low concentrations of the compound. The inactivation of some but not all serotypes in a time-, concentration-and temperaturedependent way by R 61837 indicated a direct interaction between the drug and the viral particles. The antiviral activity of the compound was confirmed in the human target cells for rhinoviruses by experiments using nasal polyp explant cultures.

The most common pathogens include coxsackie virus (CV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, no antiviral agents with low toxicity and drug resistance are currently available in clinic therapy. The present study aimed to examine the antiviral activities of emodin (an ingredient of Rheum palmatum) against CVB 5 and RSV infections, in an attempt to discover new antiviral agents for virus infection. The monomer emodin was extracted and isolated from Rheum palmatum. The antiviral activities of emodin on HEp-2 cells were evaluated, including virus replication inhibition, virucidal and anti-absorption effects, by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and plaque reduction assay (PRA). The kinetics of virus inhibition by emodin in a period of 14 h was further determined by plaque assay and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF-α) mRNA expressions after emodin treatment (7.5, 15, 30 μmol/L) were also assessed by qPCR post-infection. The results showed that emodin had potent inhibitory activities against CVB 5 and RSV, with the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) ranging from 13.06 to 14.27 μmol/L and selectivity index (SI) being 5.38-6.41 μmol/L. However, emodin couldn't directly inactivate the viruses or block their absorption to cells. It acted as a biological synthesis inhibitor against CVB 4 and RSV in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, especially during the first 0-4 h post-infection. Moreover, emodin could decrease the mRNA expression of IFN-α but enhance TNF-γ expression significantly compared to the viral controls in vitro. Our results provide a molecular basis for development of emodin as a novel and safe antiviral agent for human enterovirus and respiratory virus infection in the clinical therapy.

Anaerobe Bakterien sind häufi ge Erreger eines Hirnabszesses, jedoch selten Ursache einer eitrigen Meningitis (<1 % der Fälle). Gemischte bakterielle Infektionen fi nden sich bei etwa 1 % der Meningitisfälle, insbesondere bei Patienten mit Immunsuppression, posttraumatischer oder postoperativer Meningitis oder bei parameningealen Infektionsherden [3]. Mehr als 50 % der erwachsenen Patienten mit einer bakteriellen Meningitis haben prädisponierende Faktoren oder Grundkrankheiten, insbesondere parameningeale Infektionen (z. B. Otitis oder Sinusitis, Mastoiditis, Hirnabszess oder subdurales Empyem), eine vorausgegangene neurochirurgische Operation, einen anamnestischen Hinweis auf ein Schädel-Hirn-Trauma mit oder ohne Durafi stel, einen septischen Herd, wie z.

Splenektomie, immunsuppressive medikamentöse Th erapie, HIV-Infektion) oder eine Malignomerkrankung (. Tab. 32.1; [4]). z Pathophysiologie Durch die Ergebnisse von tierexperimentellen Studien und Zellkulturuntersuchungen konnte in den letzten Jahren unser Verständnis der komplexen pathophysiologischen Mechanismen des zerebralen Schadens im Verlauf der bakteriellen Meningitis deutlich verbessert werden [5]. Die Ursache der intrakraniellen Komplikationen liegt neben direkt toxischen Eff ekten bakterieller Toxine maßgeblich in einer durch die körpereigene Immunantwort induzierten ZNS-Schädigung. 32.1 Bakterielle Meningitis M. Klein, H.-W. Pfi ster Einführung Trotz Weiterentwicklung moderner Antibiotika in den letzten Jahren sind die Letalitätszahlen der bakteriellen (eitrigen) Meningitis weiterhin hoch; Überlebende haben häufi g neurologische Residuen. Die ungünstigen klinischen Verläufe der bakteriellen Meningitis sind meist Folge intrakranieller Komplikationen, wie z. B. eines generalisierten Hirnödems, einer zerebrovaskulären arteriellen oder venösen Beteiligung oder eines Hydrozephalus. z Inzidenz Die jährliche Inzidenz der Meningokokkenerkrankungen beträgt in Industrieländern derzeit etwa 0,5−4 Erkrankungen/100.000 Einwohner. In Deutschland wurden im Jahr 2010 383 Meningokokkenerkrankungen gemeldet; dies entspricht einer Inzidenz von etwa 0,5-0,6 Erkrankungen/100.000 Einwohner. Die Serotypisierung über die letzten Jahre zeigte, dass Serogruppe-B-Meningokokken (ca. 2/3) und Serogruppe-C-Meningokokken (ca. 1/4) am häufi gsten zu beobachten waren. Die Inzidenz der Pneumokokkenmeningitis liegt etwa bei 1-2/100.000; in Entwicklungsländern kann sie aber bis zu 20/100.000 erreichen. Durch die weite Verbreitung der Haemophilus-infl uenzae-Typ-B-Impfung ist es zu einem drastischen Rückgang der invasiven Haemophilus-infl uenzae-Typ-B-Erkrankungen, wie z. B. Meningitis und Sepsis, gekommen [2]. 27 (31,0) 14 (16,1) 6 (6,9) 5 (5,7) 3 (3,4) 2 (2,3) 2 (2,3) Pneumonie 19 (21,3) Liquorfi stel 18 (20,7) Asplenie 11 (12,6) Endokarditis 2 (2,3) 486 32 Kapitel 32 · Infektionen z Symptomatik Klinische Leitsymptome der bakteriellen (eitrigen) Meningitis sind: 4 Kopfschmerzen, 4 Meningismus und 4 hohes Fieber. Das Fehlen eines Leitsymptoms schließt allerdings die Diagnose einer bakteriellen Meningitis nicht aus. Neben den Leitsymptomen können ein Verwirrtheitssyndrom, eine Vigilanzstörung, Übelkeit und Erbrechen sowie Lichtscheu und epileptische Anfälle auft reten. Etwa 10 % der Patienten haben eine Hirnnervenbeteiligung, der Häufi gkeit nach des III., VI., VII. und VIII. Hirnnerven. Hörstörungen, die meist Folge einer eitrigen Labyrinthitis sind, fi nden sich bei etwa 10−20 % der Patienten mit bakterieller Meningitis, bei Patienten mit Pneumokokkenmeningitis sogar bei bis zu 30 %. Bei etwa 75 % der Patienten mit einer Meningokokkenmeningitis ist bei Krankenhausaufnahme ein Exanthem ( das Spektrum reicht von einzelnen Petechien bis zu ausgedehnter Purpura mit Hautnekrosen) nachweisbar [9]. Etwa 50 % der invasiven Meningokokkenerkrankungen verlaufen als eitrige Meningitis, 25 % schwerpunktmäßig als Sepsis, weitere 25 % zeigen Mischformen (Meningitis und Sepsis). Bei etwa 10−15 % der septischen Erkrankungen treten besonders schwere Formen des septischen Schocks auf, die als Waterhouse-Friderichsen-Syndrom bekannt sind und eine sehr hohe Letalität aufweisen. z Verlauf Komplikationen unterschiedlichen Schweregrades kommen bei etwa 50 % der erwachsenen Patienten mit einer bakteriellen Meningitis in der Akutphase der Erkrankung vor (.

80c223c83157e79e2c195eb742f7ae4f05743343	Both porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and swine influenza are acute, highly contagious swine diseases. These diseases pose severe threats for the swine industry and cause heavy economic losses worldwide. In this study, we have developed a chimeric viruslike particle (VLP) vaccine candidate for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and H3N2 influenza virus and investigated its immunogenicity in mice. The HA and M1 proteins from the H3N2 influenza virus and the PRRSV GP5 protein fused to the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the NA protein were both incorporated into the chimeric VLPs. Analysis of the immune responses showed that the chimeric VLPs elicited serum antibodies specific for both PRRSV GP5 and the H3N2 HA protein, and they stimulated cellular immune responses compared to the responses to equivalent amounts of inactivated viruses. Taken together, the results suggested that the chimeric VLP vaccine represents a potential strategy for the development of a safe and effective vaccine to control PRRSV and H3N2 influenza virus. C. Xue and W. Wang contributed equally to this work.
3085b3a500943dd56e4eafb7fde7215857e216b7	Objectives. We discuss two main potential sources of bias that might affect the results of the Italian nationwide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey conducted by the Italian Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Statistics in a sample of 150,000 persons in 2,000 cities for epidemiological purposes, at the end of May-beginning of June 2020. Methods. The first issue regards performance of serological tests. Comparing serological test results with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction available in an area of the Italian Region Friuli Venezia Giulia, we suspect that test performance is less than optimal, but still acceptable for estimating prevalence of antibodies. The second issue regards participation bias, which might produce distorted estimates and reduce usefulness of the survey. We show that participation bias is possible in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region and identify a number of potential causes. We acknowledge the importance of good communication and careful planning for effective interventions.
f62fbadcb8ee8e993119b25126baf7bbc58234da	Global health advocates often turn to medicine and science for solutions to enduring health risks, but law is also a powerful tool. No state acting alone can ward off health threats that span borders, requiring international solutions. A trilogy of global health law-the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, International Health Regulations (2005), and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework-strives for a safer, healthier, and fairer world. Yet, these international agreements are not well understood, and contain gaps in scope and enforceability. Moreover, major health concerns remain largely unregulated at the international level, such as non-communicable diseases, mental health, and injuries. Here, we offer reforms for this global health law trilogy.

A model using baseline patient characteristics, laboratory markers, and chest radiography can predict short-term critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with an internally validated AUC = 0.77. 2. At an example model risk threshold of 0.70, 71 of 356 patients would be predicted to develop critical illness of which 59 (83%) would be true-positives. 3. A risk calculator has been made available for download: Dutch COVID-19 risk model (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eFrdHxnOA-M_P-ijxnC2u30qk7IhMVV6YvHvJhrZ8Ws/edit#gid=0) (see Appendix E2). Chest radiographic findings, together with patient history and laboratory values, predicted critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Abbreviations: AUC = area under the ROC curve CI = confidence interval COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019 ICU = intensive care unit OR = odds ratio ROC = receiver operating characteristics RT-PCR = real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction I n P r e s s Abstract Background The prognosis of hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is difficult to predict, while the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs) is a limiting factor during the peak of the pandemic and generally dependent on a country's clinical resources. To determine the value of chest radiographic findings together with patient history and laboratory markers at admission to predict critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In this retrospective study including patients from 7th March 2020 to 24 th April 2020, a consecutive cohort of hospitalized patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from two large Dutch community hospitals was identified. After univariable analysis, a risk model to predict critical illness (i.e. death and/or ICU admission with invasive ventilation) was developed, using multivariable logistic regression including clinical, CXR and laboratory findings. Distribution and severity of lung involvement was visually assessed using an 8-point scale (chest radiography score). Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping. Performance is presented as an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis was performed, and a risk calculator was derived. The cohort included 356 hospitalized patients (69 ±12 years, 237 male) of whom 168 (47%) developed critical illness. The final risk model's variables included gender, chronic obstructive lung disease, symptom duration, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein level, lactate dehydrogenase level, distribution of lung disease and chest radiography score at hospital presentation. The AUC of the I n P r e s s model was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72-0.81, P < .001). A risk calculator was derived for individual risk assessment; Dutch COVID-19 risk model (see Appendix E2). At an example threshold of 0.70, 71 of 356 patients would be predicted to develop critical illness of which 59 (83%) would be true-positives. A risk model based on chest radiographic and laboratory findings obtained at admission was predictive of critical illness in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. This risk calculator might be useful for triage of patients to the limited number of ICU beds/facilities.
d72501b217d2f47435246abaa30b22aa1f504dc0	Background: Despite well-defined criteria for use of antibiotics in patients presenting with mild to moderate Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD), their overuse is widespread. We hypothesized that following implementation of a molecular multiplex respiratory viral panel (RVP), AECOPD patients with viral infections would be more easily identified, limiting antibiotic use in this population. The primary objective of our study was to investigate if availability of the RVP decreased antibiotic prescription at discharge among patients with AECOPD. Methods: This is a single center, retrospective, before (pre-RVP) -after (post-RVP) study of patients admitted to a tertiary medical center from January 2013 to March 2016. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription at discharge. Groups were compared using univariable and multivariable logistic-regression. Results: A total of 232 patient-episodes were identified, 133 following RVP introduction. Mean age was 68.1 (pre-RVP) and 68.3 (post-RVP) years respectively (p = 0.88). Patients in pre-RVP group were similar to the post-RVP group with respect to gender (p = 0.54), proportion of patients with BMI < 21(p = 0.23), positive smoking status (p = 0.19) and diagnoses of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, p = 0.16). We found a significant reduction in antibiotic prescription rate at discharge in patients admitted with AECOPD after introduction of the respiratory viral assay (pre-RVP 77.8% vs. post-RVP 63.2%, p = 0.01). In adjusted analyses, patients in the pre-RVP group , p = 0.019] with positive gram stain in sputum .06), p = 0.003] had the highest odds of antibiotic prescription at discharge. Conclusions: In patients presenting with mild to moderate Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD), utilization of a comprehensive respiratory viral panel can significantly decrease the rate of antibiotic prescription at discharge.

This technique enables genetic manipulation and cloning of viral genomes, gene mutation through site-directed mutagenesis, along with gene insertion or deletion, among other studies. An in vitro infection-based system including the highly attenuated vaccinia virus Ankara strain expressing the T7 RNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7, with co-transfection of three helper plasmids and a full-length cDNA plasmid, was successfully developed to rescue genetically modified Newcastle disease viruses in 1999. In this chapter, the materials and the methods involved in rescuing Newcastle disease virus (NDV) from cDNA, utilizing site-directed mutagenesis and gene replacement techniques, are described in detail.
73a79a10d08636a75863bc1124dc9ee5ebf4aeef	Loop acceleration can be used to prove safety, reachability, runtime bounds, and (non-)termination of programs operating on integers. To this end, a variety of acceleration techniques has been proposed. However, all of them are monolithic: Either they accelerate a loop successfully or they fail completely. In contrast, we present a calculus that allows for combining acceleration techniques in a modular way and we show how to integrate many existing acceleration techniques into our calculus. Moreover, we propose two novel acceleration techniques that can be incorporated into our calculus seamlessly. An empirical evaluation demonstrates the applicability of our approach.

43c296a219a62ac9f9a632490034b6fdfc7b871e	Background: Nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM) are functional CFTR tests that are used as adjunctive diagnostic tools for cystic fibrosis (CF). Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. Methods: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride >60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl − + Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine ). Results: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. Conclusions: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM.
e5cb88d82b356325cd2baf6cff0698c51d6a69e8	Background: Current guidelines for the treatment of adult severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) consist of high-quality evidence reports, but they are no longer accompanied by management protocols, as these require expert opinion to bridge the gap between published evidence and patient care. We aimed to establish a modern sTBI protocol for adult patients with both intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain oxygen monitors in place. Our consensus working group consisted of 42 experienced and actively practicing sTBI opinion leaders from six continents. Having previously established a protocol for the treatment of patients with ICP monitoring alone, we addressed patients who have a brain oxygen monitor in addition to an ICP monitor. The management protocols were developed through a Delphi-method-based consensus approach and were finalized at an in-person meeting. We established three distinct treatment protocols, each with three tiers whereby higher tiers involve therapies with higher risk. One protocol addresses the management of ICP elevation when brain oxygenation is normal. A second addresses management of brain hypoxia with normal ICP. The third protocol addresses the situation when both intracranial hypertension and brain hypoxia are present. The panel considered issues pertaining to blood transfusion and ventilator management when designing the different algorithms.
3391184e14d64c074cc6f5f7552142bcbd230178	On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared SARS-CoV-2 12 pandemic; and at present there are over 6 million cases across the globe. Based on the interim 13 guidelines of WHO, most of the countries opted for social distancing with lockdown as the 14 only way to control the pandemic. This led to 'Manufacturing' shut down, which acted as a 15 spanner in the wheel for international supply chain leading to pressure on governments to 16 review the protocols of the lockdown. We studied epidemiological parameters for 18 17 countries and obtained crossover time point referring to cumulative case active and case 18 recovery rates and the time point for the peak positive confirmation rate in a time window of 19 92 days; and linked with the respective governmental decisions. For countries awaiting 20 crossover, time series non-linear models could be used for predicting the crossover point. A 21 sample study was carried out for India. The median time for reaching crossover for 12 22 countries was 37 days, while peak positive confirmation rate was 30 days after their first 23 intervention. These countries enforced strict lockdown regulations and have shown constant 24 improvement in their recovery rate even after crossover time point. A phase wise relaxation 25 of lockdown is evident after crossover point in most of these countries. The crossover time 26 point with the subsequent increasing recovery rate can be a strategy for lockdown relaxation 27 as evident from the experiences of few countries. Also, we propose a criterion based on 28 cumulative recovery and fatality rate for micro-management of lockdown.
ac176aee62546a955278ac424f3f257d4361e710	The COVID-19 pandemic is having a dramatic impact on societies and economies around the world. With various measures of lockdowns and social distancing in place, it becomes important to understand emotional responses on a large scale. In this paper, we present the first ground truth dataset of emotional responses to COVID-19. We asked participants to indicate their emotions and express these in text and created the Real World Worry Dataset of 5,000 texts (2,500 short + 2,500 long texts). Our analyses suggest that emotional responses correlated with linguistic measures. Topic modeling further revealed that people in the UK worry about their family and the economic situation. Tweet-sized texts functioned as a call for solidarity, while longer texts shed light on worries and concerns. Using predictive modeling approaches, we were able to approximate the emotional responses of participants from text within 14% of their actual value. We encourage others to use the dataset and improve how we can use automated methods to learn about emotional responses and worries about an urgent problem.
d019cc0c8a7b587567d5dab9aaa78f4aeb3a02b9	Background: HHV-6 has been implicated in a number of neurological disorders. Recent evidence has suggested high incidence of HHV-6 infection in patients (46%) undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). Objective: To investigate whether HHV-6 plays a role in the development of fatal encephalopathy in an allogeneic post-BMT patient using an unbiased approach. Results: Detection of HHV-6 viral DNA sequence and RNA expression were demonstrated in fresh frozen post-mortem autopsy material derived from the insular cortex using a multi-virus array platform. In addition, PCR analysis by real-time quantitative TaqMan demonstrated high viral burden in multiple brain regions tested. Sequencing analysis of PCR product confirmed the virus to be HHV-6 variant B. Conclusions: Active infection as demonstrated by expression of viral RNA and high viral load in the CNS suggest a possible pathogenic role of HHV-6 in development neurologic complications post-BMT.
de39e37e07803e02fc2509e95736d6586daa8f47	To validate the diagnostic accuracy of the Augurix SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid immunoassay diagnostic test (RDT) for COVID-19. In this unmatched 1:1 case-control study, blood samples from 46 real-time RT-PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized cases and 45 healthy donors (negative controls) were studied. Diagnostic accuracy of the IgG RDT was assessed against both an in-house recombinant spike-expressing immunofluorescence assay (rIFA), as an established reference method (primary endpoint), and the Euroimmun SARS-CoV2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (secondary endpoint). Results: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male (61% versus 20%; p=0.0001) and older (median 66 versus 47 years-old; p<0.001) than controls. Whole blood IgG-RDT results showed 86% and 93% overall Kendall concordance with rIFA and IgG ELISA, respectively. IgG RDT performances were similar between plasma and whole blood. Overall, RDT sensitivity was 88% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 70-96), specificity 98% (95%CI: 90-100), PPV 97% (95%CI: 80-100) and NPV 94% (95%CI: 84-98). The IgG-RDT carried out from 0 to 6 days, 7 to 14 days and >14 days after the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test displayed 30%, 73% and 100% positivity rates This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved in the COVID-19 group, respectively. When considering samples taken >14 days after RT-PCR diagnosis, NPV was 100% (95%CI:90-100), and PPV was 100% (95%CI:72-100). The Augurix IgG-RDT done in whole blood displays a high diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in high COVID-19 prevalence settings, where its use could be considered in the absence of routine diagnostic serology facilities.
7199a81fb005467b02274e99864aa9e88fa279f8	Introduction: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) account for a high proportion of ICU admissions, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the main pathogen responsible for these infections. However, little is known on the clinical features and outcomes of ICU patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. The aims of this study were to provide epidemiological data and to determine risk factors of mortality in patients admitted to ICU for severe S. pneumoniae CAP. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of two prospectively-acquired multicentre ICU databases (2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008). Patients admitted for management of severe pneumococcal CAP were enrolled if they met the 2001 American Thoracic Society criteria for severe pneumonia, had life-threatening organ failure and had a positive microbiological sample for S. pneumoniae. Patients with bronchitis, aspiration pneumonia or with non-pulmonary pneumococcal infections were excluded. Results: Two hundred and twenty two patients were included, with a median SAPS II score reaching 47 . Acute respiratory failure (n = 154) and septic shock (n = 54) were their most frequent causes of ICU admission. Septic shock occurred in 170 patients (77%) and mechanical ventilation was required in 186 patients (84%); renal replacement therapy was initiated in 70 patients (32%). Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 101 patients. The prevalence of S. pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin was 39.7%. Although antibiotherapy was adequate in 92.3% of cases, hospital mortality reached 28.8%. In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were age (OR 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02-1.08)), male sex (OR 2.83 (95% CI: 1.16-6.91)) and renal replacement therapy (OR 3.78 (95% CI: 1.71-8.36)). Co-morbidities, macrolide administration, concomitant bacteremia or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome. Conclusions: In ICU, mortality of pneumococcal CAP remains high despite adequate antimicrobial treatment. Baseline demographic data and renal replacement therapy have a major impact on adverse outcome.
a7655a74468e485dfd7f45390c5be4c4aa9361a8	The largest nosocomial outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in South Korea in 2015. Health Care Personnel (HCP) are at high risk of acquiring MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections first identified in 2003. This study described the similarities and differences in epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 183 confirmed global MERS cases and 98 SARS cases in Taiwan associated with HCP. The epidemiological findings showed that the mean age of MERS-HCP and total MERS cases were 40 (24~74) and 49 (2~90) years, respectively, much older than those in SARS [SARS-HCP: 35 (21~68) years, p = 0.006; total SARS: 42 (0~94) years, p = 0.0002]. The case fatality rates (CFR) was much lower in MERS-HCP [7.03% (9/128)] or SARS-HCP [12.24% (12/ 98)] than the MERS-non-HCP [36.96% (34/92), p<0.001] or SARS-non-HCP [24.50% (61/ 249), p<0.001], however, no difference was found between MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP [p = 0.181]. In terms of clinical period, the days from onset to death [13 (4~17) vs 14.5 (0~52), p = 0.045] and to discharge [11 (5~24) vs 24 (0~74), p = 0.010] and be hospitalized days [9.5 (3~22) vs 22 (0~69), p = 0.040] were much shorter in MERS-HCP than SARS-HCP. Similarly, days from onset to confirmation were shorter in MERS-HCP than MERS-non-HCP [6 (1~14) vs 10 (1~21), p = 0.044]. In conclusion, the severity of MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP was lower than that of MERS-non-HCP and SARS-non-HCP due to younger age and early confirmation in HCP groups. However, no statistical difference was found in PLOS ONE |
26aae7b7a42eef330ea6a93f1219aee64615d6b7	We advance the premise that to navigate crisis, rather than reactively cutting costs by culling middle management, top managers can benefit from enabling radical change initiatives by middle managers. Contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the COVID-19 crisis, we ask: How can Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) support marketing middle managers (MMMs) in initiating radical change in crisis situations? We take the position that marketing managers' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new-to-the-firm. We then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about 'who does what' in radical change initiatives from the marketing function, focusing on the underemphasized possibility of MMMs initiating change and CMOs implementing. Building on recent findings on 'change role reversal', we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate, while top managers implement. This unconventional change route would see CMOs taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis, while MMMs take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives. We identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal-approach faced by MMMs throughout three stages of innovation-enabled radical change proposed by Burgelman (1991; variation-selection-retention) and chart corresponding roles that CMOs can play to support MMMs: advisor, judge, and guardian. Three tangible final questions addressed to CMOs guide managerial applications, while considerations outside scope are also discussed.
cb3db1ce83a60e27c8957b1526b351ee08846c0a	This review article summarizes the strengths and limitations of the Wells-Riley and the dose-response models for risk assessment of respiratory diseases. Even with many efforts by various investigators to develop and modify the risk assessment models, some limitations still persist. This review serves as a reference for further development of infection risk assessment models of respiratory diseases. The Wells-Riley model and dose-response model offer specific advantages. Risk assessors can select the approach that is suitable to their particular conditions to perform risk assessment.
7129bd41342e71c70ba95c8c55c14b5ce478331e	Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a worldwide distributed pathogen of the respiratory tract. The objectives of this study were to identify HMPV infections among children with influenza-like illness (ILI) in Wuhan and to assess circulation patterns and molecular diversity of HMPV in this area. From July 2008 to December 2013, a total of 3,883 throat swab samples were collected from ILI outpatients under 16 years old. HMPV RNA was detected in 171 samples (4.40%). All the four subtypes of HMPV were identified, among which A2 was the most common subtype (61/145, 42.1%), followed by B1, B2, and A1. During the study period, HMPV circulation presented a biennial alternation between high and low incidence in Wuhan and the seasonal peak also shift between winter and spring in two continuous seasons. Subtype A2, B1, and B2 co-circulated during the study period, with genotype A prevailing in epidemic season 2008-2009 and 2012-2013, and genotype B prevailing during other periods. This large-scale analysis of HMPV prevalence in ILI outpatient children improves the understanding of local HMPV circulation patterns and provides molecular epidemic evidence for comparative analysis of HMPV infection.
55e2128872c8d48d13986565d55d3a7493e7a494	Although several studies have reported on the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), clinical course of the most severe cases requiring treatment in ICU have been insufficiently reported. A 73-year-old man traveling on a cruise ship with history of hypertension and dyslipidemia developed high fever, dyspnea and cough after 7 days of steroid treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputa polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination. His respiratory function deteriorated despite treatments with lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, azithromycin and meropenem at a regional hospital. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU in the tertiary university hospital on day 10 (ICU day 1). Interferon beta-1b subcutaneous injection was initiated immediately to enhance anti-viral therapy, and favipiravir on ICU day 10 upon availability. Progression of organ dysfunctions necessitated inhalation of nitrogen oxide for respiratory dysfunction, noradrenaline for cardiovascular dysfunction and continuous renal replacement therapy for renal dysfunction. His blood samples PCR also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating viremia, concomitantly with elevated IL-6 levels. VV-ECMO was initiated after sudden exacerbation of respiratory dysfunction on ICU day 7 to maintain oxygenation. The sustained excessive inflammatory cytokines in the present case might have led to the exacerbation of the disease, requiring vigorous organ support therapies to allow for survival and recovery from the rapid progression of multiple organ dysfunctions and severe respiratory failure.
5a89b93e5c8c6fb1352d9881f6ca6b592ef4af30	A longstanding and still-increasing threat to the effective treatment of infectious diseases is resistance to antimicrobial countermeasures. Potentially, the targeting of host proteins and pathways essential for the detrimental effects of pathogens offers an approach that may discover broad-spectrum anti-pathogen countermeasures and circumvent the effects of pathogen mutations leading to resistance. Here we report implementation of a strategy for discovering broad-spectrum host-oriented therapies against multiple pathogenic agents by multiplex screening of drugs for protection against the detrimental effects of multiple pathogens, identification of host cell pathways inhibited by the drug, and screening for effects of the agent on other pathogens exploiting the same pathway. We show that a clinically used antimalarial drug, Amodiaquine, discovered by this strategy, protects host cells against infection by multiple toxins and viruses by inhibiting host cathepsin B. Our results reveal the practicality of discovering broadly acting anti-pathogen countermeasures that target host proteins exploited by pathogens.
21f445f1c48f64ce15101c9da9c046e0c0ad833d	A few animals have been suspected to be intermediate hosts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, a large-scale single-cell screening of SARS-CoV-2 target cells on a wide variety of animals is missing. Here, we constructed the single-cell atlas for 11 representative species in pets, livestock, poultry, and wildlife. Notably, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 target cells in cat was found considerably higher than other species we investigated and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were detected in multiple cell types of domestic pig, implying the necessity to carefully evaluate the risk of cats during the current COVID-19 pandemic and keep pigs under surveillance for the possibility of becoming intermediate hosts in future coronavirus outbreak. Furthermore, we screened the expression patterns of receptors for 144 viruses, resulting in a comprehensive atlas of virus target cells. Taken together, our work provides a novel and fundamental strategy to screen virus target cells and susceptible species, based on single-cell transcriptomes we generated for domesticated animals and wildlife, which could function as a valuable resource for controlling current pandemics and serve as an early warning system for coping with future infectious disease threats.
36d5e1125b6ed32f729840a9aa7a381eafd90904	The protective effect of a mouse hepatitis virus type-4 (MHV-4)-specific CD8 ÷ cytotoxic T cell clone and a CD4 ÷ helper T cell clone was examined by the adoptive transfer into brains of mice lethally infected with MHV-4. Mice survived acute encephalitis if more than 5 × 105 cells of either type of the virus-specific T cell clones had been transferred into H-2-matched recipients by 1 day post-infection. Although the adoptive transfer of both types of the T cell clones suppressed viral growth and viral antigen-positive cells in the brains, a significant inhibition of virus replication by the cytotoxic T cell clone was detected prior to that induced by the helper T cell clone. Histologically, cell destruction was prominent in the brains of mice which received the cytotoxic T cell clone. These results demonstrate that both the CD8 ÷ cytotoxic T cell and the CD4 ÷ helper T cell can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the central nervous system.
643059679cd268bcfd1e5e8290f6659b2ac07a22	In the past decade, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become a timely and cost-effective alternative to bacterial identification. The MALDI-ToF MS technique analyzes the total protein of culturable microorganisms at the species level and produces a mass spectra based on peptides which is compared to a database of identified profiles. Consequently, unique signatures of each microorganism are produced allowing identification at the species and, more importantly, strain level. Our present study proposes that the MALDI-ToF MS can be further used to screen functional and metabolic differences. While other studies applied the MALDI-ToF technique to identify subgroups within species, we investigated how various environmental factors could alter the unique bacterial signatures. We found that genetic and phenotypic differences between microorganisms belonging to the same species can be reflected in peptide-mass fingerprints generated by MALDI-ToF MS. These results suggest that MALDI-ToF MS can screen intra-species phenotypic differences of several microorganisms.
2a10024ead8ae518fa44f80876913fc4961f17ab	Nucleic acid (NA) amplification techniques are now commonly used to diagnose and manage patients with infectious diseases. The growth in the number of Food and Drug Administrationeapproved test kits and analyte-specific reagents has facilitated the use of this technology in clinical laboratories. Technological advances in NA amplification techniques, automation, NA sequencing, and multiplex analysis have reinvigorated the field and created new opportunities for growth. Simple, sample-in, answer-out molecular test systems are now widely available that can be deployed in a variety of laboratory and clinical settings. Molecular microbiology remains the leading area in molecular pathology in terms of both the numbers of tests performed and clinical relevance. NA-based tests have reduced the dependency of the clinical microbiology laboratory on more traditional antigen detection and culture methods and created new opportunities for the laboratory to impact patient care. This chapter reviews NA testing as it applies to specific pathogens or infectious disease syndromes, with a focus on those diseases for which NA testing is now considered the standard of care and highlights the unique challenges and opportunities that these tests present for clinical laboratories.
56ec24b06770347bc7dd532eb66c65f0cddc6f62	Disaster risk reduction is an increasingly important policy issue, especially in developing countries that suffer most of the global human and economic losses associated with disasters. Indeed, public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses. In Saudi Arabia, many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters, such as floods, disease epidemics, and sandstorms. However, studies on public perception of disaster risk in the country are few and nascent. Therefore, based on a questionnaire survey (n ¼ 683), this paper explores public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in Dammam, a coastal metropolis in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that although almost two-thirds (64.7%) of the participants are aware of disasters, and 81% are concerned about disaster risks, less than half (47.3%) believe that their settlements could be at risk. While 37% opine that disasters are caused by both natural factors and human activities, about half (54%) indicate that they can personally contribute to reducing disaster risks. Chi-square analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between place of residence and perception of disaster risks (χ2 (6) ¼ 56.18, p < 0.05), and between place of residence and concern about disaster risks (χ2 (12) ¼ 68.47, p < 0.05). The paper recommends raising public awareness and encouraging positive behaviors in reducing disaster risks in the study area and similar environments.
d7d36c25ba96c7358470ac6d5989710f5da81d27	Prevention and control of infection in dentistry is an essential matter that has gained immense attention in recent years. There exist a lack of scientific data about the cross-transmission and its associated risk, especially in the dental health care setting of Pakistan. This article will evaluate the emerging challenges and threats for the dental community in Pakistan attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, there exists a significant knowledge gap regarding the state-and institutional-level infection prevention and control (IPC) policies and practices and not much is known about the development, implementation, and monitoring of IPC policies and its challenges.
05461d4e32964b84a09ec6c148a2e3a937b71cc4	Although the COVID-19 is known to cause by human-to-human transmission, it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission. A retrospective study is conducted to study whether air quality index (AQI), four ambient air pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 and CO) and five meteorological variables (daily temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, temperature difference and sunshine duration) could increase COVID-19 incidence in Wuhan and XiaoGan between Jan 26 th to Feb 29 th in 2020. First, a significant correlation was found between COVID-19 incidence and AQI in both Wuhan (R 2 = 0.13, p<0.05) and XiaoGan (R 2 = 0.223, p<0.01). Specifically, among four pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was prominently correlated with PM 2.5 and NO 2 in both cities. In Wuhan, the tightest correlation was observed between NO 2 and COVID-19 incidence (R 2 = 0.329, p<0.01). In XiaoGan, in addition to the PM 2.5 (R 2 = 0.117, p<0.01) and NO 2 (R 2 = 0.015, p<0.05), a notable correlation was also observed between the PM 10 and COVID-19 incidence (R 2 = 0.105, p<0.05). Moreover, temperature is the only meteorological parameter that constantly correlated well with COVID-19 incidence in both Wuhan and XiaoGan, but in an inverse correlation (p<0.05). AQI, PM 2.5 , NO 2 , and temperature are four variables that could promote the sustained transmission of COVID-19.
f7ee7afaf51dae79d4b480b8b9aa926b03f638c0	Due to an increasing emergence of new and drug-resistant strains of the influenza A virus (IAV), developing novel measures to combat influenza is necessary. We have previously shown that inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway reduces IAV infection. In this study, we aimed to identify antiviral human microRNAs (miRNAs) that target the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Using a miRNA expression library, we identified 85 miRNAs that up-regulated and 20 miRNAs that down-regulated the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Fifteen miRNAs were validated to up-regulate and five miRNAs to down-regulate the pathway. Overexpression of four selected miRNAs (miR-193b, miR-548f-1, miR-1-1, and miR-509-1) that down-regulated the Wnt/βcatenin signalling pathway reduced viral mRNA, protein levels in A/PR/8/34-infected HEK293 cells, and progeny virus production. Overexpression of miR-193b in lung epithelial A549 cells also resulted in decreases of A/PR/8/34 infection. Furthermore, miR-193b inhibited the replication of various strains, including H1N1 (A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/ 33, A/Oklahoma/3052/09) and H3N2 (A/Oklahoma/309/2006), as determined by a viral reporter luciferase assay. Further studies revealed that β-catenin was a target of miR-193b, and β-catenin rescued miR-193b-mediated suppression of IAV infection. miR-193b induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and delayed vRNP nuclear import. Finally, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of miR-193b to the lung reduced viral load in mice challenged by a sublethal dose of A/PR/8/34. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR-193b represses IAV infection by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signalling.

da34fa5f447c30574f7fccf2015210e8cc3496da	Informed consent process has become a challenging issue before surgery for any emergency obstetric care during this COVID pandemic. There is an increased risk of morbidity if there is a need of intensive care unit postoperatively and a risk of high mortality if patient has symptoms of COVID-19. Admission to intensive care unit adds on to the financial burden to the patient. Also, there is an increased risk of perinatal anxiety and depression during the COVID pandemic. When an asymptomatic carrier develops symptoms of COVID after delivery or caesarean section, the morbidity increases. So we have designed an informed consent form for patients undergoing emergency obstetric surgeries incorporating some points specific for COVID-19.
7b8315c3f5d1cd55f61954e29c624a7fe1f9e30a	We report the temporal-spatial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among inpatients in a hospital ward during a major nosocomial outbreak and discuss possible mechanisms for the outbreak. Methods. All inpatients who had stayed in the same ward as the initial index case patient for any duration before isolation were recruited into a cohort and followed up to document the occurrence of SARS. The normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols at different locations of the ward was estimated by use of computational fluid dynamics modeling. The attack rates in the various subgroups stratified by bed location were calculated. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to document important risk factors. Results. The overall attack rate of SARS was 41% (30 of 74 subjects). It was 65%, 52%, and 18% in the same bay, adjacent bay, and distant bays, respectively ( ). Computation fluid dynamics modeling indicated that P p .001 the normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols was highest in the same bay and lowest in the distant bays. Cox regression indicated that staying in the ward on 6 or 10 March entailed higher risk, as well as staying in the same or adjacent bays. The epidemic curve showed 2 peaks, and stratified analyses by bed location suggested 11 generation of spread. Conclusions. The temporal-spatial spread of SARS in the ward was consistent with airborne transmission, as modeled by use of computational fluid dynamics. Infected health care workers likely acted as secondary sources in the latter phase of the outbreak.
0bf39c12d7c4576441079e2e758ec1eacfe015d1	Background: Virus entry involves multiple steps and is a highly orchestrated process on which successful infection collectively depends. Entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction, and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen. Such studies have provided abundant direct evidence on how viruses interact with receptor molecules on the cell surface, induce cell signaling at the point of initial contact with the cell to facilitate internalization, and exploit existing endocytic mechanisms of the cell for their ultimate infectious agenda. However, there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes. Herein, we describe an optimized laboratory procedure to isolate individual organelles during different stages of endocytosis by performing subcellular fractionation. This methodology is established using Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells as a model. With KSHV and other herpesviruses alike, envelope glycoproteins have been widely reported to physically engage target cell surface receptors, such as integrins, in interactions leading to entry and subsequent infection. : Subcellular fractionation was used to isolate early and late endosomes (EEs and LEs) by performing a series of centrifugations steps. Specifically, a centrifugation step post-homogenization was utilized to obtain the postnuclear supernatant containing intact intracellular organelles in suspension. Successive fractionation via sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed to isolate specific organelles including EEs and LEs. Intracellular KSHV trafficking was directly traced in the isolated endosomal fractions. Additionally, the subcellular fractionation approach demonstrates a key role for integrins in the endosomal trafficking of KSHV. The results obtained from fractionation studies corroborated those obtained by traditional imaging studies. This study is the first of its kind to employ a sucrose flotation gradient assay to map intracellular KSHV trafficking in HFF cells. We are confident that such an approach will serve as a powerful tool to directly study intracellular trafficking of a virus, signaling events occurring on endosomal membranes, and dynamics of molecular events within endosomes that are crucial for uncoating and virus escape into the cytosol.
2bfa3061be84264c2b2bfb1a972894bd847b550f	The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) relies on clinical features and lags behind the current understanding of the molecular specificity of disease pathobiology, necessitating approaches that incorporate growing biomedical data for classifying diseases to meet the needs of precision medicine. Our analysis revealed that the heterogeneous molecular diversity of disease chapters and the blurred boundary between disease categories in ICD should be further investigated. Here, we propose a new classification of diseases (NCD) by developing an algorithm that predicts the additional categories of a disease by integrating multiple networks consisting of disease phenotypes and their molecular profiles. With statistical validations from phenotype-genotype associations and interactome networks, we demonstrate that NCD improves disease specificity owing to its overlapping categories and polyhierarchical structure. Furthermore, NCD captures the molecular diversity of diseases and defines clearer boundaries in terms of both phenotypic similarity and molecular associations, establishing a rational strategy to reform disease taxonomy.
f42e5b1a8e7e77b998cb233f689c4107e19c7c1d	Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have always been one of the major threats to public health. Although the implementation of mandatory testing for 4 classical transfusion-transmitted infectious-human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and syphilis-has reduced the transfusion risk of these pathogens, the potential threat of various EID agents and their constantly evolving variants to blood safety in China is not fully understood. This review presents 9 representative EID agents that are autochthonous and epidemic nationally or regionally in China. The epidemiologic status and distribution of these EID agents among donors and/or healthy populations are summarized. The potential risks of these EID agents to blood safety are discussed. The review also explores strategies to strengthen hemovigilance systems and studies to further evaluate the impact of EID agents on blood safety.
63c852b15c7bdf38a82978addf8487cd4041845e	Disasters, particularly earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, war-related complications, famine and infectious epidemics, have been a part of recorded human experience. From Pompeii to the Johnston Flood and World War II and the Black Plague to the Spanish Influenza, there have been catastrophic occurrences that will not long be forgotten by either legend or history books. Nevertheless, those occurrences were relatively few and far-between before the mid-twentieth century. Indeed, the nature of disasters has changed since then. From terrorists taking advantage of`new technology' to weather-related events that cause trillions of dollars worth of damages and economic loss, the world has evolved. In the last 50 to 60 years alone, the risk and frequency of events with multiple injuries and deaths has increased dramatically [1±4] and it is bound to increase logarithmically over the next half century. Not only is the earth more heavily-populated with human beings settling across many more regions of the planet, but there are also larger concentrations of human inhabitants dependent on other resources for sustenance. Dependency on others for complicated food supply chains, refrigeration, fuel and power sources and public health hygiene (sewage handling), makes human populations more vulnerable than ever before and less self-sufficient. In addition, these large, vulnerable population centers are often concentrated in high-risk locales such as metropolitan cities where very frequent and multiple person-to-person contacts occur. Often they are along disaster prone areas, be they in coastline or sub-sea level reclaimed lands. In addition, the world now faces a broadened spectrum of disasters, ranging from terrorist bombings, unconventional wars, nuclear releases, transportational mishaps, worldwide infectious disease epidemics and chemical discharges (technology-generated) to floods, famine, earthquakes, tornadoes, cyclones, fires, and other natural disasters' [2, 4] . It may also be that human technology has increased the likelihood of more severe and more frequent natural disasters. Whether it is global warming (from industry and omnipresent internal combustion machines) leading to stronger and more frequent hurricanes or the jumbo jet that rapidly translocates deadly influenza viruses around the planet, the threat continues to evolve far beyond the world of our grandparents. Therefore, although famine, war, plagues, earthquakes and such threats have darkened the human experience, the on-going spiral of human populations, the rapid growth of technology, relatively easy world-wide travel for millions and the exponential expansion of at-risk industries and domiciles have now conspired to dramatically increase human exposure to catastrophic events. In turn, the potential for casualties resulting from each incident is more likely to be much larger [2] and the magnitude of the economic costs beyond our current comprehension. The recent undersea earthquake in the Indian Ocean that sent towering, 700 kilometer per hour tsunamis across Southern Asia resulted in a tremendous number of deaths and morbidity because of the sheer volume of exposures in vulnerable sites. The 1950s seaside fishing villages of 5,000 local inhabitants had become cosmopolitan, internationally-populated, destination resorts hosting hundreds of thousands supported by multi-national industries and technology. Such expanding population bases living and working in vulnerable situations along the at-risk seashores such as Phuket, Thailand, or in major metropolitan settlements built below sea level such as New Orleans, USA, provided unprecedented fodder for disaster, regardless of continent. Likewise, the recent earthquake in Pakistan that killed tens of thousands in a few minutes might not have had such an effect 50 years ago when such concentrated populations centers did not exist. If that were not enough, beyond a higher risk for casualties and frequency of events, the events have now become global with far-reaching psychological and sociological impact. While still true in some respects, the old adage that ªall disasters are localº may have become somewhat anachronistic since the mid-20 th Century. Although the Christmas 2004 tsunami disaster occurred in Southern Asia, it affected many other countries worldwide because those nation's citizens and many international businesses were involved. Mass air travel, economic strategic initiatives and evolving technology have all changed the face of`local' disasters. With the rapid growth of air travel and relatively affluent worldwide economies, travel and sightseeing have morphed from an occasional pastime of the very privileged and the eclectic adventurer into a prevailing norm of worldwide mass tourism. Likewise, industries have also become global, often seeking heavily-populated sites where labor may be more economical and local workforces readily available to work for lower wages. A large number of the victims of the Indian Ocean tsunamis were foreign nationals operating businesses and many, many tourists, including celebrities, were caught up in this Asian calamity as well. Thus, in many ways, disasters throughout the world have now become multinational in nature, having global impact, an impact amplified by mass media coverage and internet streaming of the events. Even so, a disaster in New Orleans involving mainly geography of only a few tens of kilometers, had ramifications in major cities hundreds of miles of way. Both before, and especially after, the strike of Hurricane Katrina in late August of 2005, many tens of thousands of evacuees had to settle in Dallas and Houston affecting resources in those cities and taxing the local medical system. For example, one Dallas shelter (750 kilometers from New Orleans) treated twice the number of medical problems and emergencies (among the evacuees) than it would on a day-to-day basis in the city's main trauma center. This sudden surge in medical problems required the establishment of a`field' medical facility for more than two weeks after the storm had dissolved. Not only did those patients have their day-to-day medical, dental and psychological needs, but they were now at greater risk in terms of compromised immune systems (nutrition/sleep deprived and psychologically-stressed), but also because of crowded conditions. From another perspective, despite the relatively fewer number of deaths than the
393370b4ecc8a512cd673b64b3040d12ce30eb0a	Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is a significant public health concern world-wide. Numerous graph-based methods have been applied to biomedical graphs for predicting ADRs in pre-marketing phases. ADR detection in post-market surveillance is no less important than premarketing assessment, and ADR detection with large-scale clinical data have attracted much attention in recent years. However, there are not many studies considering graph structures from clinical data for detecting an ADR signal, which is a pair of a prescription and a diagnosis that might be a potential ADR. In this study, we develop a novel graphbased framework for ADR signal detection using healthcare claims data. We construct a Drug-disease graph with nodes representing the medical codes. The edges are given as the relationships between two codes, computed using the data. We apply Graph Neural Network to predict ADR signals, using labels from the Side Effect Resource database. The model shows improved AUROC and AUPRC performance of 0.795 and 0.775, compared to other algorithms, showing that it successfully learns node representations expressive of those relationships. Furthermore, our model predicts ADR pairs that do not exist in the established ADR database, showing its capability to supplement the ADR database.
c316bbd2cf404d0a96daf6c1966f2041181c9431	Background: Clinical differentiation of influenza from dengue and other febrile illnesses (OFI) is difficult, and available rapid diagnostic tests have limited sensitivity. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to compare clinical and laboratory findings between (i) influenza and dengue and (ii) influenza and OFI. Results: Of 849 enrolled patients, the mean time between illness onset and hospital presentation was 1.7, 3.7, and 3 days for influenza, dengue, and OFI, respectively. Among pediatric patients (≤18 years) (445 influenza, 24 dengue, and 130 OFI), we identified absence of rashes, no leukopenia, and no marked thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <100 × 10 9 cells/L) as predictors to distinguish influenza from dengue, whereas rhinorrhea, malaise, sore throat, and mild thrombocytopenia (platelet counts 100-149 × 10 9 /L) were predictors that differentiated influenza from OFI. Among adults (>18 years) (81 influenza, 124 dengue, and 45 OFI), no leukopenia and no marked thrombocytopenia distinguished influenza from dengue, while rhinorrhea and malaise differentiated influenza from OFI. A diagnostic algorithm developed to distinguish influenza from dengue using rash, leukopenia, and marked thrombocytopenia showed >90% sensitivity to identify influenza in pediatric patients. Conclusions: This study identified simple clinical and laboratory parameters that can assist clinicians to distinguish influenza from dengue and OFI. These findings may help clinicians diagnose influenza and facilitate appropriate management of affected patients, particularly in resource-poor settings.
a0f29aaebf701ab133a66886ccb35bffe6033662	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emphasized the urgency to develop effective therapeutics. Drug repurposing screening is regarded as one of the most practical and rapid approaches for the discovery of such therapeutics. The 3C like protease (3CL pro ), or main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug target as it is a specific viral enzyme and plays an essential role in viral replication. We performed a quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro assay. Twenty-three small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro have been identified with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 28.85 μM. Walrycin B (IC50 = 0.26 µM), Hydroxocobalamin (IC50 = 3.29 µM), Suramin sodium (IC50 = 6.5 µM), Z-DEVD-FMK (IC50 = 6.81 µM), LLL-12 (IC50 = 9.84 µM), and Z-FA-FMK (IC50 = 11.39 µM) are the most potent 3CL pro inhibitors. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was confirmed in 7 of 23 compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. The results demonstrated a set of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitors that may have potential for further clinical evaluation as part of drug combination therapies to treating COVID-19 patients, and as starting points for chemistry optimization for new drug development.

1f4c7f7b1707f71e188cc621e323bd5751b3e6a8	Nucleic acid aptamers have minimal immunogenicity, high chemical synthesis production, low cost and high chemical stability when compared with antibodies. However, the susceptibility to nuclease degradation, rapid excretion through renal filtration and insufficient binding affinity hindered their development as drug candidates for therapeutic applications. In this review, we will discuss methods to conquer these challenges and highlight recent developments of chemical modifications and technological advances that may enable early aptamers to be translated into clinical therapeutics. 3 of 21 cap the unreacted free 5 -OH group. In the last step (Step 4), the new phosphite is oxidized to the corresponding phosphotriester by iodine. The cycle is repeated, once for each base, to produce the required oligonucleotide. Finally, the nucleic acid aptamers could be cleaved from the CPG by concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The protecting groups for phosphates and heterocyclic bases could be removed at the same time [18, 37, 38] .
5912189e6ca5053f8e7a2de341c90341f737aa7e	Background: In 2009, pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (2009 H1N1) emerged worldwide, causing morbidity and mortality that disproportionately affected young adults. Upper respiratory infection (URI), largely due to adenovirus, is an endemic cause of morbidity in military training. Whether clinical presentations differ or excess morbidity results from coinfection is unclear. demographic, clinical, and PCR data from throat and nasal specimens for adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 were prospectively collected. Results: 375 trainees with URI enrolled and were tested for both adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 by PCR (median age 20; 89% male). Adenovirus PCR was positive in 72% (96% serotype E-4) and 2009 H1N1 in 20%. Males were more likely to have adenovirus and females more likely to have 2009 H1N1 (p = 0.047). Subjects with 2009 H1N1 presented an average of 1 week earlier in training, had shorter illness duration before enrollment, less sore throat, diarrhea, and fewer abnormal findings on throat exam. Coryza and cough were more common with 2009 H1N1 compared to adenovirus. Subjects with 2009 H1N1 were less likely to have adenovirus than those without, despite persistently high frequencies of adenovirus detections during peak 2009 H1N1 weeks (15% vs. 83%, p , 0.01). Coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 was rare (4%). Rates of hospitalization and pneumonia did not differ between the adenovirus, 2009 H1N1, or coinfected groups. Conclusion: Military trainees with 2009 H1N1 vs. adenovirus have differing clinical presentations, and males are more likely to have adenovirus. Despite high frequencies of adenovirus infection, coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 is rare and apparently does not result in increased morbidity.
54440a66bfd06044fbfdf583650fbc4cebf21241	Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens, the relevance of which increased due to the emergence of new human coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, HKU1 and NL63. Together with toroviruses, arteriviruses, and roniviruses the coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales. So far antivirals are hardly available to combat infections with viruses of this order. Therefore, various antiviral strategies to counter nidoviral infections are under evaluation. Lectins, which bind to N-linked oligosaccharide elements of enveloped viruses, can be considered as a conceptionally new class of virus inhibitors. These agents were recently evaluated for their antiviral activity towards a variety of enveloped viruses and were shown in most cases to inhibit virus infection at low concentrations. However, limited knowledge is available for their efficacy towards nidoviruses. In this article the application of the plant lectins Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Cymbidium sp. agglutinin (CA) and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) as well as non-plant derived pradimicin-A (PRM-A) and cyanovirin-N (CV-N) as potential antiviral agents was evaluated. Three antiviral tests were compared based on different evaluation principles: cell viability (MTT-based colorimetric assay), number of infected cells (immunoperoxidase assay) and amount of viral protein expression (luciferase-based assay). The presence of carbohydrate-binding agents strongly inhibited coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, feline coronaviruses serotypes I and II, mouse hepatitis virus), arteriviruses (equine arteritis virus and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus) and torovirus (equine Berne virus). Remarkably, serotype II feline coronaviruses and arteriviruses were not inhibited by PRM-A, in contrast to the other viruses tested. an infection with a member of the order of the Nidovirales can have serious health consequences (De Clercq, 2004) . Nidovirales consist of a broad group of viruses with glycosylated envelopes containing linear, single-stranded RNA genomes of positive polarity. Coronaviruses belong to this order together with toroviruses, arteriviruses, and roniviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . In the past, the control or prevention of nidovirus infections by antiviral compounds were not considered as a high priority because they were not regarded serious enough to justify costly development of specific drugs. Reliance on vaccines for protection is possible for only a few of these nidoviruses and 0166-3542/$ -see front matter
f9eaabc286a2e41358a889ecd686f439341c9c64	Background Vitamin D and calcium are essential dietary components for human body, and their deficiency is linked to poor bone health and osteoporosis. Adequate knowledge of health staff regarding vitamin D and calcium is critical for general population awareness. The current work was to evaluate the awareness regarding the importance of vitamin D and calcium among undergraduate health science students in Al Kharj. Methods A self-distributed validated questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted. Undergraduate health science students in Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University from the College of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, College of Dentistry, and College of Applied Medical Science were included in the study. Students between the age of 18 and 25 years have participated in the study. Results Four hundred fifty-seven undergraduate health science students participated in the study. The vast majority of students knew about the importance of calcium (96.7%) and vitamin D (95.4%), whereas only 89.4% knew about osteoporosis. The participant students reported in their answers that the sources of knowledge were the Internet (42.8%), physicians (41.5%), textbooks (21.2%), teachers (19.1%), family and relatives (18.3%), and/or other sources (6.1%). The overall attitude was poor in about (54%) of the participants showing gender differences regarding sun-exposure duration and supplementation of calcium and vitamin D. Conclusion The study revealed that both male and female undergraduate health science students in Al Kharj were familiar with the importance of vitamin D and calcium; however they reported improper attitude that warrants further health guidance and educational programs.

Particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the outdoor air pollutants that are major factors in human's diseases, causing especially adverse respiratory effects in humans. On the other hand, the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infections is an issue of great importance. The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases. Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses on the adverse effects on the respiratory system. Given the rabid news of the subject, we have also paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which is the responsible of the COVID-19. Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants impairs recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease. This deserves immediate and in-depth experimental investigations.
914fb283fda8e01141dec673c7011e6d610dbc06	Aim: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has accelerated all over the world, and global health-care systems have become overwhelmed with potentially infectious patients seeking testing and care. It is essential to set up effective and useful zoning to prevent the spread of infection to and from medical staff or other patients with effective use of standard precautions with personal protective equipment (PPE). We repurposed a general ward into an acute care unit for severe COVID-19 patients taking into consideration airflow, the direction of movement of medical staff, and prevention of the spread of infection to medical staff and other patients. We checked the daily condition and body temperature of all medical staff for 60 days. Results: There was no evidence of COVID-19 infection in any medical staff or other patients during the period thanks to effective and useful zoning with PPE. Conclusion: Special wards and rooms should be set up for future protection of medical staff and other patients, and prevent the explosion of COVID-19 infection with effective and useful zoning with PPE.
179de6ab89ebce62b62ae37ffb3768d087e48576	The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and deaths caused by it all over the world have imposed great concern on the scientific community to develop potential drugs to combat Coronavirus disease-19 . In this regard, lichen metabolites may offer a vast reservoir for the discovery of antiviral drug candidates. Therefore, to find novel compounds against COVID-19, we created a library of 412 lichen compounds and subjected to virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro). All the ligands were virtually screened, and 27 compounds were found to have high affinity with Mpro. These compounds were assessed for drug-likeness analysis where two compounds were found to fit well for redocking studies. Molecular docking, drug-likeness, X-Score, and toxicity analysis resulting in two lichen compounds, Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid with Mpro-inhibiting activity. These compounds were finally subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to compare the dynamics behavior and stability of the Mpro after ligand binding. The binding energy was calculated by MM-PBSA method to determine the intermolecular protein-ligand interactions. Our results showed that two compounds; Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid had the binding free energy of − 42.42 kJ mol/1 and − 57.85 kJ mol/1 respectively as compared to reference X77 (− 91.78 kJ mol/1). We concluded that Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid show considerable structural and pharmacological properties and they can be used as hit compounds to develop potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. These lichen compounds may be a suitable candidate for further experimental analysis. The online version of this article (https ://doi.

The dynamics emerging from infodemics have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns. For the field of Business and Economics, understanding these dynamics is of ultimate importance: it supports, for example, anticipating individual behavior, which might help reduce the uncertainty entailed by the COVID-19 pandemic and allows for assessing the efficiency of policy decisions to contain its effects. In addition to is central, whereby the way information spreads in a society is strongly affected by the employed algorithms for information provision and by personalization. From the perspective of Linguistics, specific language signals in communication which emerge during pandemics have to be taken into account (e.g., emotion-related words, avoiding causal terms). Considering linguistic patterns in the context of infodemics appears to be highly relevant as they strongly affect how information is interpreted, factchecked, made sense of by non-expert persons, and the way misinformation is automatically detected. From a Cognitive Psychology point of view, the focus is on how motives, intuition and affect influence the search and evaluation of information, and on how cognitive processes, the digital information environment and linguistic patterns together shape individuals' understanding of critical events, risk perception and behavior. The perspective of Business and Economics allows for integrating these perspectives into the wider context of economic systems (e.g., organizations or the society). By doing so, the grounds for gaining fundamental insights into the dynamics emerging from infodemics are prepared. We make the perspectives of these scientific disciplines explicit and propose a way to integrate them. The contribution of further disciplines is strongly needed, which is why we conclude with a call to action which should encourage researchers to collaborate across scientific disciplines and unfold collective creativity which will push forward research on infodemics substantially.
1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5	Recently a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China and has infected more than 571000 people leading to more than 26000 deaths. Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar "GA" rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals.
3ffa62baea2f955470dff08e4d5e157ce0e28cc0	Glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most invasive type of glial tumors, which rapidly grows and commonly spreads into nearby brain tissue. It is a devastating brain cancer that often results in death within approximately 12 to 15 months after diagnosis. In this work, optimal control theory was applied to regulate intracellular signaling pathways of miR-451-AMPK-mTOR-cell cycle dynamics via glucose and drug intravenous administration infusions. Glucose level is controlled to activate miR-451 in the up-stream pathway of the model. A potential drug blocking the inhibitory pathway of mTOR by AMPK complex is incorporated to explore regulation of the down-stream pathway to the cell cycle. Both miR-451 and mTOR levels are up-regulated inducing cell proliferation and reducing invasion in the neighboring tissues. Concomitant and alternating glucose and drug infusions are explored under various circumstances to predict best clinical outcomes with least administration costs.
f018f29902aeb637122ec6e8b714df07a29a420e	The mapping of SARS-CoV-2 human protein-protein interactions by Gordon and colleagues revealed druggable targets that are hijacked by the virus. Here, we highlight several oncogenic pathways identifi ed at the host-virus interface of SARS-CoV-2 to enable cancer biologists to apply their knowledge for rapid drug repurposing to treat COVID-19, and help inform the response to potential long-term complications of the disease.
b0551f4421cff629e4e94ba44a155d3063abd58c	Development of small molecule compounds that target several cancer drivers has shown great therapeutic potential. Here, we developed a new generation of highly potent thienopyranone (TP)based inhibitors for the BET bromodomains (BDs) of the transcriptional regulator BRD4 that have the ability to simultaneously bind to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and/or cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6). Analysis of the crystal structures of the complexes, NMR titration experiments and ic 50 measurements reveal the molecular basis underlying the inhibitory effects and selectivity of these compounds toward BDs of BRD4. The inhibitors show robust cytotoxic effects in multiple cancer cell lines and induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We further demonstrate that concurrent disruption of the acetyllysine binding function of BRD4 and the kinase activities of PI3K and CDK4/6 by the TP inhibitor improves efficacy in several cancer models. Together, these findings provide further compelling evidence that these multi-action inhibitors are efficacious and more potent than single inhibitory chemotypes. The bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins have emerged as promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of a wide array of human diseases, particularly inflammation and cancer 1-5 . Of the four members of the BET family proteins, BRD4 is the most thoroughly characterized, and its aberrant activity has been associated with NUT midline carcinoma, colon, breast and prostate cancers, neuroblastoma, and hematopoietic cancers. BRD4 overexpression has been shown to promote tumor growth by stimulating transcription of major oncogenic drivers, such as MYC. Most recently BRD4 has been identified as the human protein to which the protein E from the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds 6 . BRD4 contains two bromodomains, BRD4 BD1 and BRD4 BD2 , that recognize acetylated lysine residues in histones and non-histone proteins. Specifically, BRD4 BD1 binds to acetylated histones, including poly-acetylated histone H4, recruiting and/or stabilizing BRD4-containing transcription complexes at target gene promoters and enhancers 7 , whereas the second bromodomain, BRD4 BD2 , is also capable of associating with acetylated non-histone proteins 8 . A wide array of inhibitors of BRD4 as well as pan-BET inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials, yet there is a pressing need to improve the efficacy of inhibition. BET inhibitors are known to produce variable anti-proliferative effects, and cancer cells often develop resistance to the drugs through activating compensating survival signaling pathways that bypass the drug action 9-12 . These limitations can be overcome through concurrent targeting multiple signaling pathways that support cancer growth and characterized by synthetic lethality relationship. This could be achieved through applying a combination of synergistic individual inhibitors or using a single molecule capable of binding to multiple targets. A combined therapy through inhibiting BRD4 and PI3K by a single molecule has been shown to produce potent antitumor effects in several cancer models driven by MYC [13] [14] [15] . In addition to reducing tumor growth, inhibition of both BRD4 and PI3K reduces the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and stimulates antitumor immune responses 16 . Dual and triple activity inhibitors specific for BET and other known oncogenic drivers, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), MAPK, PLK1, HDAC, CBP/p300, and ALK are being developed 17-21 .
db1d021803af3ab8ad6ea7d6043c551ae04dfe74	Early differentiation between emergency department (ED) patients with and without corona virus disease (COVID-19) is very important. Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Between March 13 th and March 24 th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihoodratio (LR) + 2.81 and LR-0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score ≥3; n=17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score ≥2; n=137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick first screening tool.

For influenza A H1, the reaction condition was 30 min at 45°C for reverse transcription followed by 2 min at 94°C, and 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 52°C and 1 min at 68°C; and a final extension of 10 min at 68°C. The reaction condition for influenza A H3 was similar, except that reverse transcription was carried out at 50°C and the annealing temperature was 55°C. The PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by SYBR safe DNA stain (Invitrogen) under gel documentation system. The product size of influenza A H1 was 431 bp; the influenza A H3 product was 232 bp.
18b5af09d99469ad7872da1b5bf4beb19c909ec1	The discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 adds a new level of complexity to the understanding of the renin-angiotensin system. The high catalytic efficiency of ACE2 for the generation of angiotensin (ANG)-1-7 from ANG II suggests an important role of ACE2 in preventing ANG II accumulation, while at the same time enhancing ANG-1-7 formation. ACE and ACE2 may have counterbalancing functions and a regulatory role in fine-tuning the rate at which ANG peptides are formed and degraded. By counterregulating the actions of ACE on ANG II formation, ACE2 may play a role in maintaining a balanced status of the reninangiotensin system. This review focuses on the function of ACE2 and its possible roles in kidney disease and hypertension. Studies using models of ACE2 ablation and the pharmacologic administration of an ACE2 inhibitor suggest that decreased ACE2 activity alone or in combination with increased ACE activity may play a role in both diseases.
50cae8bd5dfed34526905abc62b06df051a3d767	As one of the most important mosquito-borne viral diseases, dengue infection is now becoming a global concern due to its rapid spread and rise in incidence. Currently, there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral drug for dengue virus (DENV) infection. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa) and its related derivatives have been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses. However, it is unknown whether Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, affects DENV infection. Here, we found that the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in DENV-permissive cells, while the viral RNA and viral protein synthesis were not affected. Moreover, results from time-of-addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV was exhibited by targeting the virus itself, not the host cells. Directly incubating DENV with CBX resulted in a remarkable reduction of virus titer and virus infectivity. Furthermore, DENV RNA from progeny virions in the supernatants was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that the antiviral activity of CBX against DENV may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself. Our work, for the first time, demonstrates that CBX has antiviral activity against DENV infection, providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against dengue.
5f6b864972de6f6797dc83a45d4aafbeeae5e9aa	The ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 has become a global public health emergency. SARScoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of COVID-19, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. For RNA viruses, virus-encoded RNA helicases have long been recognized to play pivotal roles during viral life cycles by facilitating the correct folding and replication of viral RNAs. Here, our studies show that SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) possesses the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase) and RNA helicase activities that can hydrolyze all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices dependently of the presence of NTP, and further characterize the biochemical characteristics of these two enzymatic activities associated with SARS-CoV-2 nsp13. Moreover, we found that some bismuth salts could effectively inhibit both the NTPase and RNA helicase activities of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, our findings demonstrate the NTPase and helicase activities of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, which may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication and serve as a target for antivirals.
712cd2a0fd735773ed63251f1367ed78a843e223	Background: In the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of COVID-19 relies on 22 population engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions, which is driven by their risk 23 perception, anxiety level and knowledge. There may also be regional discrepancies in these drivers 24 due to different historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses and cultures. As 25 such, this study compared psycho-behavioral responses in two regions during the early phase of 26 the pandemic. 27 28 Methods: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered among adults in Hong Kong 29 (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK) during the early phase of each respective epidemic. 30 Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19, 31 anxiety level and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. 32 Logistic regression models, including interaction terms to quantify regional differences, were used 33 to assess the association between explanatory variables and the adoption of social-distancing 34 measures. 35 36 Results: Data of 3431 complete responses (HK:1663; UK:1768) were analysed. Perceived severity 37 differed by region (HK: 97.5%; UK: 20.7%). A large proportion of respondents were 38 abnormally/borderline anxious (HK:64.8%; UK:45.9%) and regarded direct contact with infected 39 individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (HK:94.0-98.5%; UK:69.2-93.5%), with HK 40 identifying additional routes. HK reported high levels of adoption of social-distancing (HK:32.4-41 93.7%; UK:17.6-59.0%) and mask-wearing (HK:98.8%; UK:3.1%). The impact of perceived 42 3 severity and perceived ease of transmission on the adoption of social-distancing varied by region. 43 In HK, they had no impact, whereas in the UK, those who perceived severity as "high" were more 44 likely to adopt social-distancing (aOR:1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as "easy" 45 were prone to both general social-distancing (aOR:2.00, 95% CI:1.57, 2.55) and contact avoidance 46 (aOR:1.80, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social-distancing did not vary 47 by region. 48 49 Discussion: These results suggest that health officials should ascertain and consider baseline levels 50 of risk perception and knowledge in the populations, as well as prior sensitisation to infectious 51 disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk communication should be 52 done through suitable media channels -and trust should be maintained -while early intervention 53 remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response. 54 55 Word count: 343 56 57
e4384f263f004b328db50697fe6f76384f2a6631	To detect the presence of antibodies in blood against SARS-CoV-2 in a highly sensitive and specific manner, here we describe a robust, inexpensive ($200), 3D-printable portable imaging platform (TinyArray imager) that can be deployed immediately in areas with minimal infrastructure to read coronavirus antigen microarrays (CoVAMs) that contain a panel of antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-1, MERS, and other respiratory viruses. Application includes . CC-BY-NC: bioRxiv preprint 2 basic laboratories and makeshift field clinics where a few drops of blood from a finger prick could be rapidly tested in parallel for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with a test turnaround time of only 2-4 h. To evaluate our imaging device, we probed and imaged coronavirus microarrays with COVID-19-positive and negative sera and achieved a performance on par with a commercial microarray reader 100x more expensive than our imaging device. This work will enable large scale serosurveillance, which can play an important role in the months and years to come to implement efficient containment and mitigation measures, as well as help develop therapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
eadfdc80f614e6c236b8a60a1e9c2af93a7b9990	Determining the microbiologic etiology of enteric infection remains an elusive goal. Conventional approaches, including culture, microscopy, and antigen-based tests have significant limitations such as limit of detection and the need for multiple procedures. Molecular diagnostics, especially PCR based tests, are rapidly changing research and practice in infectious diseases. Diarrheal disease, with its broad range of potential infectious etiologies, is well suited for multiplex molecular testing. This review highlights examples of currently employed molecular tests, as well as ways in which these tests can be applied in the future. The absence of a gold standard for the microbiologic cause of diarrhea means that the clinical significance of detected organisms may not always be clear. Conventional wisdom is that there should be one main pathogen causing diarrhea, however our thinking is challenged by increased detection of mixed infections. Thus, the successful incorporation of molecular diagnostics for diarrheal disease into practice will require both a careful understanding of the technical aspects and research to define their clinical utility.
d7b3663559b1af765ae7a9363aab7795ac66c685	Flaviviruses are the causative agents of severe diseases such as Dengue or Yellow fever. The replicative machinery used by the virus is based on few enzymes including a methyltransferase, located in the Nterminal domain of the NS5 protein. Flaviviral methyltransferases are involved in the last two steps of the mRNA capping process, transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine onto the N7 position of the cap guanine (guanine-N7 methyltransferase) and the ribose 2 O position of the first nucleotide following the cap guanine (nucleoside-2 O methyltransferase). The RNA capping process is crucial for mRNA stability, protein synthesis and virus replication. Such an essential function makes methyltransferases attractive targets for the design of antiviral drugs. In this context, starting from the crystal structure of Wesselsbron flavivirus methyltransferase, we elaborated a mechanistic model describing protein/RNA interaction during N7 methyl transfer. Next we used an in silico docking procedure to identify commercially available compounds that would display high affinity for the methyltransferase active site. The best candidates selected were tested in vitro to assay their effective inhibition on 2 O and N7 methyltransferase activities on Wesselsbron and Dengue virus (Dv) methyltransferases. The results of such combined computational and experimental screening approach led to the identification of a high-potency inhibitor.

d986c44da50830e309f5d89cd81595edf1f05200	Tuberculosis (TB), as the major infectious disease in the world, has devastating consequences for not only humans, but also cattle and several wildlife species. This disease presents additional challenges to human and veterinary health authorities given the zoonotic nature of the pathogens responsible for the disease across species. One of the main public health challenges regarding zoonotic TB (ZTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is that the true incidence of this type of TB in humans is not known and is likely to be underestimated. To effectively address challenges posed by ZTB, an integrated One Health approach is needed. In this manuscript, we describe the rationale, major steps, timeline, stakeholders, and important events that led to the assembling of a true integrated multi-institutional and interdisciplinary team that accomplished the ambitious goal of developing a ZTB roadmap, published in October, 2017. It outlines key activities to address the global challenges regarding the prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of ZTB. We discuss and emphasize the importance of integrated approaches to be able to accomplish the short (year 2020) and medium term (year 2025) goals outlined in the ZTB roadmap.
9729f7d3bc0199e03edea694804c99b25d287413	As an opportunistic pathogen with high mortality rates, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may lead to fatal disseminated CMV infection of the premature and newborn; thus necessitating the demonstration of CMV-DNA with clinical history and/or histopathological findings of CMV infection and defining other bacterial and viral infection agents with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in udden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) cases as we aimed in this study. 314 (144 female, 170 male) SUDI cases were prospectively investigated from January 2013 to January 2015 in Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institution. The study includes 87 tissue samples of 39 cases for postmortem histopathological examination of interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, colitis or tubulointerstitial nephritis and/or accompanying chronic sialadenitis. CMV-DNA was found positive in 35 (40.2%) salivary gland, 19 (21.8%) lung, 1 (1.1%) tonsil, and 1 (1.1%) brain tissues. CMV sialadenitis and/or CMV pneumonia associated with other viral and/or bacterial agents were detected in 23 (60%) of 39 infant cases. The demonstration of CMV-DNA would significantly clarify the cause of death and collection of epidemiological data in SUDI cases with clinical history and histopathological findings of CMV infection accompanying chronic CMV sialadenitis. Furthermore, CMV suppresses the immune system, and may predispose to other bacterial and/or viral infections in these cases. Post-mortem molecular investigations are useful in explaining cause of death in SUDI with a suspicion of infection in forensic autopsies.

d5d7c5ada2462aab2fa09789b1ef5ffe8e7f8d64	Background: The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia is increasing in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. The utility of CMV-DNA viral load measurement has not been standardized, and viral cut-off values have not been established. This study was designed to investigate the utility of CMV quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using bronchial washing fluid. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the microbiologic and pathologic results of bronchial washing fluid and biopsy specimens in addition to the patients' clinical characteristics. Results: A total of 565 CMV qRT-PCR assays were performed using bronchial washing fluid from patients with hematologic malignancies. Among them, 101 were positive for CMV by qRT-PCR; of these, 24 were diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and 70 with CMV infection, and 7 were excluded due to a diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis rather than viral pneumonia. The median CMV load determined by qPCR was 1.8 × 10 5 copies/mL (3.6 10 3 -1.5 × 10 8 ) in CMV pneumonia patients and 3.0 × 10 3 copies/mL (5.0 × 10 2 -1.1 × 10 5 ) in those diagnosed with CMV infection (P < 0.01). Using the ROC curve, the optimal inflection points were 18,900 copies/mL (137,970 IU/mL) in post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients, 316,415 copies/mL (2,309,825 IU/mL) in no-BMT patients and 28,774 copies/mL (210,054 IU/mL) in all patients. The CMV titers in bronchial washing fluid determined by qRT-PCR differed significantly between patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and those with CMV infection. The viral cut-off values in bronchial washing fluid were suggested for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia, which were different depending on the BMT status.
fca7adbc5fdaeba0fedd1201e496704b1a888556	To understand viral disease, detection and identification of these viruses are essential. Although PCR is widely used for rapid virus identification due to its low cost and high sensitivity and specificity, very few online database resources have compiled PCR primers for RNA viruses. To effectively detect viruses, the MRPrimerV database (http://MRPrimerV.com) contains 152 380 247 PCR primer pairs for detection of 1818 viruses, covering 7144 coding sequences (CDSs), representing 100% of the RNA viruses in the most up-to-date NCBI RefSeq database. Due to rigorous similarity testing against all human and viral sequences, every primer in MRPrimerV is highly target-specific. Because MR-PrimerV ranks CDSs by the penalty scores of their best primer, users need only use the first primer pair for a single-phase PCR or the first two primer pairs for two-phase PCR. Moreover, MRPrimerV provides the list of genome neighbors that can be detected using each primer pair, covering 22 192 variants of 532 RefSeq RNA viruses. We believe that the public availability of MRPrimerV will facilitate viral metagenomics studies aimed at evaluating the variability of viruses, as well as other scientific tasks.
d14116a192211c5de769212a4f7af243580cdd35	The spike protein is the major viral attachment protein of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and ultimately determines viral tropism. The S1 subunit of the spike is assumed to be required for virus attachment. However, we have previously shown that this domain of the embryo-and cell culture adapted Beaudette strain, in contrast to that of the virulent M41 strain, is not sufficient for binding to chicken trachea (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . In the present study, we demonstrated that the lack of binding of Beaudette S1 was not due to absence of virus receptors on this tissue nor due to the production of S1 from mammalian cells, as S1 proteins expressed from chicken cells also lacked the ability to bind IBVsusceptible embryonic tissue. Subsequently, we addressed the contribution of the S2 subunit of the spike in IBV attachment. Recombinant IBV Beaudette spike ectodomains, comprising the entire S1 domain and the S2 ectodomain, were expressed and analyzed for binding to susceptible embryonic chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) in our previously developed spike histochemistry assay. We observed that extension of the S1 domain with the S2 subunit of the Beaudette spike was sufficient to gain binding to CAM. A previously suggested heparin sulfate binding site in Beaudette S2 was not required for the observed binding to CAM, while sialic acids on the host tissues were essential for the attachment. To further elucidate the role of S2 the spike ectodomains of virulent IBV M41 and chimeras of M41 and Beaudette were analyzed for their binding to CAM, chicken trachea and mammalian cell lines. While the M41 spike ectodomain showed increased attachment to both CAM and chicken trachea, no binding to mammalian cells was observed. In contrast, Beaudette spike ectodomain had relatively weak ability to bind to chicken trachea, but displayed marked extended host range to mammalian cells. Binding patterns of chimeric spike ectodomains to these tissues and cells indicate that S2 subunits most likely do not contain an additional independent receptor-binding site. Rather, the interplay between S1 and S2 subunits of spikes from the same viral origin might finally determine the avidity and specificity of virus attachment and thus viral host range. (M.H. Verheije). Coronaviruses have a strict species tropism, which is largely determined by the interaction of the viral attachment protein spike (S) with the host cell (recently reviewed in Belouzard et al., 2012; Graham and Baric, 2010) . The coronaviral S protein is a highly glycosylated class I viral fusion protein (Bosch et al., 2003) , which in some coronaviruses, including IBV, is cleaved during synthesis into an S1 and an S2 subunit by the host serine protease furin (de Haan et al., 2004; ). The S1 is essential for initial attachment of the virus, while the membrane anchored S2 subunit or domain, containing the remaining part of the ectodomain, a transmembrane domain and an endodomain, drives virus-cell fusion (reviewed in Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012). All coronaviral receptor-binding domains (RBD) currently identified are located within the S1 subunit or domain (reviewed in Belouzard et al., 2012; Graham and Baric, 2010) . For IBV, the exact location of the RBD has, however, not yet been elucidated. Heterogeneity between IBV strains is mainly associated with differences in S1, but IBV spike 0168-1702/$ -see front matter

A feasible and reliable method which allows the simultaneous analysis of 1 and its aglycone, 18β-glycyrrhetic acid (2), by means of an isocratic HPLC procedure is described. The system uses a C 8 column as the stationary phase, and a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, water and glacial acetic acid as the mobile phase. Good linearity was found in the concentration ranges 1-50 and 0.05-2.50 µ µ µ µ µg/mL for 1 and 2, respectively. A simple and rapid sample pre-treatment, based on the extraction of the two analytes with a mixture of water and ethanol, was developed for the examination of liquorice confectionery products and root samples. The HPLC method was shown to be appropriate, in terms of precision and feasibility, for the quality control of the analytes in these matrices. a Solvent A, acetonitrile:water:glacial acetic acid (35:64:1, v/v/v); solvent B, methanol.

e09e904ff206052537e487864dfb605e2f3d3fe7	Globally, the AIDS response relies on active participation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society. In China, the government is the main provider of health and social services, and the role of NGOs is more limited than in other countries. Despite this, China has opened the door for NGO participation in its AIDS response, initially because of donor pressure but increasingly due to official acknowledgment of the important role these groups play in controlling the epidemic. Since the first AIDS NGOs were established in China in the 1990s, Chinese AIDS NGOs have made unique contributions to China's AIDS response in critical areas like access to drugs, support for treatment compliance, outreach to marginalized at-risk groups, and efforts to reduce stigma among marginalized populations. However, there has been a substantial drop-off in donor funding in recent years, and although the Chinese government has filled the funding gap, demonstrating its commitment to the sector, recent policy moves toward greater control over the work and funding of NGOs threatens their survival. Thus far, China's AIDS response has been noteworthy, but these new NGO funding and regulatory developments pose significant challenges to the next phase of outreach, prevention, treatment, and care.
5cded487793694de49b640b3972285bfc8431cfb	Coccidiosis and necrotic enteritis (NE) are among the most significant diseases affecting the poultry industry. These diseases have become more prominent in the wake of policies to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal production. This has led to more research focused on better understanding the immune system and its responses to pathogen challenge, and thus developing informed strategies to exploit immune responses that can support enhanced disease resistance and growth performance. Some chicken breeds and lines show greater resistance or susceptibility to various diseases, and thus these birds maybe able to shed light on immune processes or pathways that contribute to the more resistant/susceptible state. This review attempts to identify potentially important genes that show some consistency in (relative) up or downregulation in key tissues between the resistant and susceptible chickens. For coccidiosis and NE, relative downregulation of IL-10 and (slightly less consistently) upregulation of IFNγ appear to be features of more resistant birds. Data for IFN-α, IL-12, and IL-17D are currently less consistent. Gene expression data from NE studies have identified some potentially interesting, perhaps less well understood, immune-related genes (e.g., TCF12, BCL2, IRF2, TRAF3, TAB3, etc.,) that maybe associated with the resistant and/or susceptible phenotype. Salmonella and Campylobacter are important foodborne pathogens harbored by the chicken intestinal tract, while infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis are also important viral diseases of poultry. We, therefore, consider whether there are consistent features from resistant/susceptible disease models with these pathogens that relate to findings from the coccidiosis and NE studies. It is not anticipated that ideal immune responses to these pathogens will be identical but rather that consistent elements maybe identified that could help inform breeding or alternative strategies to support general disease resistance and enhanced (and efficient) flock productivity.
3092aaf0c9cb4755fc393f3f2687b5c760c3eb80	Viral channel-forming proteins comprise a class of viral proteins which, similar to their host companions, are made to alter electrochemical or substrate gradients across lipid membranes. These proteins are active during all stages of the cellular life cycle of viruses. An increasing number of proteins are identified as channel proteins, but the precise role in the viral life cycle is yet unknown for the majority of them. This review presents an overview about these proteins with an emphasis on those with available structural information. A concept is introduced which aligns the transmembrane domains of viral channel proteins with those of host channels and toxins to give insights into the mechanism of function of the viral proteins from potential sequence identities. A summary of to date investigations on drugs targeting these proteins is given and discussed in respect of their mode of action in vivo.
0adc2dfd5f26656ce3527dbb5dec379d44d0601e	Background. Umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) is used for patients who do not have a matched donor, but engraftment often takes longer than with a standard allogeneic transplant, likely increasing the risk for infection. We characterized specific infections and outcomes in adults undergoing UCBT at our 2 centers. Methods. All adults who underwent UCBT between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015 were included. Infectious episodes from 6 months before to 2 years after UCBT were reviewed. Results. Fifty-seven patients underwent UCBT; 47 had neutrophil engraftment. A total of 179 infectious episodes occurred in 55 patients, 73 (41%) within 30 days post-UCBT. Viruses caused 85 (47%) infections. Cytomegalovirus caused 32 infectious episodes and was most common from day 30 to 100. Human herpesvirus 6 occurred in 28 episodes, was most common within 30 days, and caused 1 death. Bacteria were responsible for 82 (46%) infections, most commonly bacteremias due to Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, and Enterobacteriaceae. Of 11 invasive fungal infections, 9 were aspergillosis, 4 of which were fatal. Overall mortality was 56% in the first year. Thirteen deaths were from infection; 11 occurred in the first 100 days and 7 in the first 30 days post-UCBT. Of 10 patients who never engrafted, 9 died, 6 from infection, within 100 days post-UCBT. Conclusions. Infectious complications were common after UCBT, especially in the first 30 days. Deaths from viral infections were fewer than expected. Delayed engraftment and nonengraftment continue to convey increased risk for fatal bacterial and fungal infections post-UCBT.
bfcb22212525a49970dc301582343e388fc5cfd6	Background: Fever is one of the most common symptoms among children and is usually caused by respiratory infections. Although Japanese health authorities have long recommended gargling to prevent respiratory infections, its effectiveness among children is not clear. Methods: The children in this observational study were enrolled from 145 nursery schools in Fukuoka City, Japan. Children in the exposure group were instructed to gargle at least once a day. The endpoints of this study were incidence of fever during the daytime and incidence of sickness absence. Differences among gargling agents for each endpoint were also analyzed. Results: A total of 19 595 children aged 2 to 6 years were observed for 20 days (391 900 person-days). In multivariate logistic regression, the overall odds ratio (OR) for fever onset in the gargling group was significantly lower (OR = 0.68). In age-stratified analysis, ORs were significantly lower at age 2 (OR = 0.67), 4 (OR = 0.46), and 5 (OR = 0.41) years. Regarding sickness absence, the overall OR was 0.92 (not significant) in the gargling group. In age-stratified analysis, ORs were significantly lower at age 4 (OR = 0.68), 5 (OR = 0.59), and 6 (OR = 0.63) years. In subgroup analysis, significantly lower ORs for fever onset were observed for children who gargled with green tea (OR = 0.32), functional water (OR = 0.46), or tap water (OR = 0.70). However, the ORs were not significant for sickness absence. Conclusions: Gargling might be effective in preventing febrile diseases in children.
1016fc58593492ea195614b6e3ed8d1be960973a	Background: Clinical recovery does not mean full recovery. It is necessary to explore the aftereffects of COVID-19 in patients and compare the laboratory features of COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias in the recovery stages. Methods: Forty-seven cases of COVID-19 and 45 cases of other viral pneumonias (control) were included in this study. The laboratory parameters were compared between COVID-19 and control patients as well as severe and moderate COVID-19 patients from the clinical recovery stage to the 4 weeks postdischarge recovery stage. Results: A higher RDW-CV level and neutrophil percentage and lower levels of total proteins, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and MCH were found in COVID-19 patients compared with those in controls from the clinical recovery to the postdischarge recovery stages. Further analysis showed that decreases in lymphocytes, total proteins, and SOD and elevations in neutrophils, FDP, CRP, and ESR were more common in severe than moderate cases of COVID-19 during hospitalization; however, differences in these indicators, except total proteins, were not observed in the postdischarge recovery stages. Additionally, only 76.9% of COVID-19 patients were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the convalescence stage, and one patient that was negative for specific IgG was reinfected. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that patients recovering from COVID-19 might need better care than that patients with other viral pneumonias due to the possibility of having poor immunity and nutritional conditions. These findings provide new insights to improve the understanding of COVID-19 and improve care for patients affected by these kinds of pandemics in the future.

6893257fb68c32f067a3329295fa31028b49e0b1	Background: We are currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China-where the outbreak started-seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries. Nonetheless, authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures, even if not everything is known. Methods: To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work referred initially to the situation in Spain as of February 28, 2020, where a few dozens of cases had been detected, but has been updated to match the current situation as of 13 April. We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Results: Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. Conclusions: Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. However, preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally. The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals' flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation. Therefore, resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the new cases and isolate them.
a59d8354b07bc9b4b69558fa73e680360f8070dc	An epidemic curve is a graphic depiction of the number of outbreak cases by date of illness onset, ordinarily constructed after the disease outbreak is over. However, a good estimate of the epidemic curve early in an outbreak would be invaluable to health care officials. On the other hand, from the end of February, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil seems to not following the Europe, or in particular, Italy or Spain. Even if less tests have been applied, there are less deaths occurring in Brazil than in both cited countries. However, due to the few applied tests, there is no certain planning on the real number of active cases. To estimate the number of future cases, epidemiologists make an educated guess as to how many people might become affected. We have proposed a simple fitting model using a simulated annealing technique, testing it with the South Korea data. We have tested and discussed the uncertainties of the model. We also have analyzed the trends in the confirmed cases using this model for the five most affected countries plus Brazil along several epidemic weeks.
b9881ca556b8d6e74c2fe3b9c2195429fcb0d09d	Background: The novel influenza A pandemic virus (H1N1pdm) caused considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide in 2009. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical course, duration of viral shedding, H1N1pdm evolution and emergence of antiviral resistance in hospitalized cancer patients with severe H1N1pdm infections during the winter of 2009 in Brazil. We performed a prospective single-center cohort study in a cancer center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hospitalized patients with cancer and a confirmed diagnosis of influenza A H1N1pdm were evaluated. The main outcome measures in this study were in-hospital mortality, duration of viral shedding, viral persistence and both functional and molecular analyses of H1N1pdm susceptibility to oseltamivir. Results: A total of 44 hospitalized patients with suspected influenza-like illness were screened. A total of 24 had diagnosed H1N1pdm infections. The overall hospital mortality in our cohort was 21%. Thirteen (54%) patients required intensive care. The median age of the studied cohort was 14.5 years (3-69 years). Eighteen (75%) patients had received chemotherapy in the previous month, and 14 were neutropenic at the onset of influenza. A total of 10 patients were evaluated for their duration of viral shedding, and 5 (50%) displayed prolonged viral shedding (median 23, range = 11-63 days); however, this was not associated with the emergence of a resistant H1N1pdm virus. Viral evolution was observed in sequentially collected samples. Conclusions: Prolonged influenza A H1N1pdm shedding was observed in cancer patients. However, oseltamivir resistance was not detected. Taken together, our data suggest that severely ill cancer patients may constitute a pandemic virus reservoir with major implications for viral propagation.
3b049cbe175fa96536f7db99118d25bb9cc62187	A novel coronavirus disease , caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept across 31 provinces in China and over 40 countries worldwide. The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China. We herein strongly urge that clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both disease infection and progression.
e0bb2e0110f5172294d8f36218061e110e6aeff7	Bats and dogs are the main reservoirs of rabies virus (RABV) in Latin America and are responsible for the maintenance of different cycles of infection. In the two neighbour and most southern Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and Santa Catarina (SC), rabies in dogs has been successfully controlled for more than 30 years. However, rabies associated to the rural cycle remains endemic, with a significant, though oscillating-annual incidence of rabies in cattle. Despite the plethora of studies on genetic analyses of Brazilian RABV, isolates from southern Brazil have only scarcely been investigated. This work was performed to identify the genetic lineages of RABVs circulating in states of RS and SC. Fifty-nine RABV cattle isolates from RS and SC were selected and submitted to reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene. In RS, the circulation of two sublineages (1A and 1B) of RABV was detected, both with characteristics of lineages usually detected in vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). In SC, only one sublineage of RABV (1B) was detected. Nevertheless, the findings reported here are expected to contribute to the understanding of the biology of the virus in the region and its interactions with the natural host D. rotundus.
a9f1c6589817bbdce27b869219799ecc22fa7ed4	Viral diseases of shrimp have caused negative effects on the economy in several countries in Asia, South America and America, where they have numerous shrimp culture industries. The studies on the immunity of shrimp and other crustaceans have mainly focused on general aspects of immunity and as a consequence little is known about the antiviral responses in crustaceans. The aim of this review is to update recent knowledge of innate immunity against viral infections in crustaceans. Several antiviral molecules have been isolated and characterized recently from decapods. Characterization and identification of these molecules might provide a promising strategy for protection and treatment of these viral diseases. In addition dsRNA-induced antiviral immunity is also included.
88836be43482650dfdb4fc0cc47ca6e2d6afd759	The pupillary light reflex (PLR) describes the constriction and subsequent dilation of the pupil in response to light as a result of the antagonistic actions of the iris sphincter and dilator muscles. Since these muscles are innervated by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, respectively, different parameters of the PLR can be used as indicators for either sympathetic or parasympathetic modulation. Thus, the PLR provides an important metric of autonomic nervous system function that has been exploited for a wide range of clinical applications. Measurement of the PLR using dynamic pupillometry is now an established quantitative, non-invasive tool in assessment of traumatic head injuries. This review examines the more recent application of dynamic pupillometry as a diagnostic tool for a wide range of clinical conditions, varying from neurodegenerative disease to exposure to toxic chemicals, as well as its potential in the non-invasive diagnosis of infectious disease.
5a0de643480abc0020d8941110964b46fd7d17b7	The emergence of highly pathogenic variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains, from 2013 to 2014, in North American and Asian countries have greatly threatened global swine industry. Therefore, development of effective vaccines against PEDV variant strains is urgently needed. Recently, it has been reported that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 domain of PEDV spike protein is responsible for binding to the 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a possible sugar co-receptor. Therefore, the NTD of S1 domain could be an attractive target for the development of subunit vaccines. In this study, the NTD spanning amino acid residues 25-229 (S25-229) of S1 domain of PEDV variant strain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). S25-229 IBs were solubilized in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) buffer containing 8 M urea and 1 mM dithiothreitol with 95% yield. Solubilized S25-229 IBs were refolded by 10-fold flash dilution and purified by one-step cation exchange chromatography with >95% purity and 20% yield. The CD spectrum of S25-229 showed the characteristic pattern of alpha helical structure. In an indirect ELISA, purified S25-229 showed strong reactivity with mouse anti-PEDV sera. In addition, immunization of mice with 20 mg of purified S25-229 elicited highly potent serum IgG titers. Finally, mouse antisera against S25-229 showed immune reactivity with native PEDV S protein in an immunofluorescence assay. These results suggest that purified S25-229 may have potential to be used as a subunit vaccine against PEDV variant strains.
a0fe165df1aca35a389771dfdfb6692a930824f8	Hectic fever (sepsis) at its inception is diffi cult to recognize but easy to treat; left untended, it becomes easy to recognize but diffi cult to treat… Machiavelli, The Prince The management of the child with sepsis represents the sine qua non of pediatric critical care medicine. Overwhelming sepsis and septic shock often manifest with concurrent derangements of cardiovascular function, intravascular volume status, respiratory function, immune regulation, renal function, coagulation, hepatic function, and metabolic function -sepsis literally affects every organ system to some degree. The degree to which any of these derangements are manifest in a given child is highly variable and infl uenced by multiple host and pathogen factors, including the child's developmental stage, the presence or absence of co-morbidities, the host's immune/infl ammatory state, the host's genetic background, and the specifi c pathogens involved. These factors combine, in turn, to profoundly infl uence the ultimate outcome. Successful management of critically ill children depends upon early recognition, early treatment with antibiotics, and early reversal of shock.
b48dbc4c8d363fb48dbf7f6b7ca9c2591720e92b	A panel of 28 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against the structural proteins of murine hepatitis virus-4, strain JHM (MHV-4) was used in three antigen binding assays to determine the extent of antigenic homology among six strains of murine coronaviruses. The antigenic determinants studied were highly conserved on the El glycoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of all strains tested. In contrast, antigenic polymorphism was observed among the E2 glycoproteins. Of three previously described antigenic determinants against which neutralizing antibodies are directed, only one, termed A(E2), was conserved on all strains. Antigenic site.B(E2) was found only on the strongly neurotropic MHV4 and site C(E2) was present on the virulent MHV4 and MHV-3 (hepatotropic) strains, but absent on the weakly pathogenic MHV-A59, MHV-1 and MHV-S strains. Four non-neutralizing antibodies against at least one topographically distinct antigenic determinant, which we previously designated D(E2), gave binding patterns consistent with two distinct sites. One of these was present on all MHV strains tested and the other was present on all strains except MHV-S. These non-neutralizing antigenic sites were redesignated E(E2) and D(E2) respectively. coronavirus, antigen, glycoprotein, monoclonal antibody, epitope, polymorphism
2274471246f2f32f361c12d0ce27c1ba9d8cd93d	A 34-year-old male came to our hospital on 21st Jan and complained of fever (peak temperature: 38.5 °C). He lived in Wuhan for the past years and came to visit his relatives in Chengdu for the Spring Festival. He reported no exposure to the "South-China Seafood Market" in Wuhan during the recent months. The fever presented on 20th Jan. He took some Cefoperazone but was not relieved. On admission, the patient had normal lymphocytes and white blood cell count but slightly increased monocyte percentage (17.0%) ( Table 1 ). The high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT) showed a mild ground-glass opacity (GGO) at right upper lobar. (Fig. 1a1 ). Fungal and other common respiratory viral infections were excluded though laboratory test. With suspicion of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, the throat swab was obtained from the patient for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The RT-PCR test kits were manufactured by Sansure Biotech Inc. (Changsha, China) and its limit of detection (LOD) was established at a Ct of 40. Before the result came out, the patient was isolated and treated with Cefoperazone continuously. On 25th Jan, his first and second SARS-CoV-2 PCR results were negative; thus, the patient was discharged. However, the patient continuously felt ill and the fever lasted. He came to our hospital again for further treatment. On this admission, the re-arranged blood test result showed reduced total white blood cell count of 2.87 × 10 9 /L, reduced neutrophil count of 1.02 × 10 9 /L, and normal lymphocytes count. The second HRCT showed that the original GGO grew larger with evidence of fibrosis ( Fig. 1b1-b3) .
2e2bc679c8393230bac2af64115bab7ed1ba62c0	We previously showed that erythropoietin (EPO) attenuates the morphological signs of spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in swine [1] without, however, improving neurological function. The clinical use of EPO has been cautioned most recently due to serious safety concerns arising from an increased mortality in acute stroke patients treated with EPO and simultaneously receiving systemic thrombolysis [2]. Carbamylated EPO (cEPO) is an EPO derivative without erythropoietic activity and devoid of the EPO side eff ects, but with apparently well maintained cytoprotective qualities [3]. We therefore tested the hypothesis whether cEPO may be equally effi cient as EPO in reducing morphological as well as functional aortic occlusion-induced spinal cord I/R injury. Methods In a randomized and blinded trial pigs received either vehicle (control, n = 9), EPO or cEPO, respectively (n = 9 each; 5,000 IU/kg over 30 minutes before and during the fi rst 4 hours of reperfusion). Animals underwent 30 minutes of thoracic aortic balloon occlusion with catheters placed immediately downstream of the A. subclavia and upstream of the aortic trifurcation. Spinal cord function was assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEP as percentage of the amplitude before aortic occlusion) and lower limb refl exes (assessed as the subjective strength of response) for a period of 10 hours after reperfusion. Tissue damage was evaluated using Nissl staining. Results Both EPO-treated and cEPO-treated animals presented with attenuated spinal cord injury in the Nissl staining (median (quartile) percentage of damaged neurons in the thoracic segments: control 27 (25,44), cEPO 8 (4,10), and EPO 5 (5,7), P <0.001 vs control group; in the lumbar segments: control 26 (19,32), cEPO 7 (5,13), EPO 8 (5,10), P <0.001 vs control group). However, while only cEPO treatment was associated with recovery of the MEP amplitude to pre-occlusion values when compared with the control group (P <0.05), lower limb refl ex response was comparably restored stronger in both treatment groups (P <0.05 vs control). Conclusions In a clinically relevant porcine model mimicking aortic crossclamping during vascular surgery repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm, cEPO protected spinal cord function and integrity as eff ective as EPO when applied at equipotent doses.

Introduction In awake, spontaneously breathing mice, inhaling hydrogen sulfi de (H 2 S) induced a hibernation-like metabolic state characterised by reduced energy expenditure and hypothermia [1], which protected against otherwise lethal hypoxia [2] and hemorrhage [3] as a result of impaired cellular energy metabolism [4]. Therefore, we investigated the metabolic eff ects of inhaled H 2 S in our model of resuscitated murine septic shock. Methods Sixteen hours after induction of sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation, anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice received 100 ppm H 2 S or vehicle over 5 hours at body temperatures of 38 and 27°C, respectively. During the observation period, hyperdynamic hemodynamics were maintained by colloid resuscitation and noradrenaline infusion [5]. Endogenous glucose production was calculated from blood 13 C6-glucose isotope enrichment derived from the rate of appearance of stable, non-radioactive labeled 1,2,3,4,5,6-13 C6 glucose during continuous isotope infusion [6]. Whole-body glucose oxidation rate was derived from the total CO 2 -production rate, the mixed expiratory 13 CO 2 / 12 CO 2 isotope ratio and the 13 C6-glucose infusion rate after the steady state was achieved. Results While endogenous glucose production was not aff ected by hypothermia, it was signifi cantly higher in the septic animals when compared with the corresponding sham operated groups, most likely due to the ongoing noradrenaline infusion. In contrast, despite the catecholamine infusion and higher glucose release, whole body glucose oxidation was signifi cantly reduced in normothermic septic animals. During hypothermia, H 2 S shifted substrate towards preferential glucose utilisation, but this eff ect disappeared in the septic mice. Conclusions H 2 S inhalation alone does not infl uence glucose metabolism once temperature is maintained at normothermic levels in anesthetised and mechanically ventilated mice. The H 2 S-related shift of energy metabo lism towards preferential carbohydrate oxidation present during hypothermia is blunted during sepsis, possibly as a result of the ongoing catecholamine treatment.
327182e27ac733136b2880cd0084140971270d69	Significant attention has been devoted to determining the credibility of online misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic on social media. Here, we compare the credibility of tweets about COVID-19 to datasets pertaining to other health issues. We find that the quantity of information about COVID-19 is indeed overwhelming, but that the majority of links shared cannot be rated for its credibility. Reasons for this failure to rate include widespread use of social media and news aggregators. The majority of links that could be rated came from credible sources; however, we found a large increase in the proportion of state-sponsored propaganda among non-credible and less credible URLs, suggesting that COVID-19 may be used as a vector to spread misinformation and disinformation for political purposes. Overall, results indicate that COVID-19 is unfolding in a highly uncertain information environment that not may amenable to fact-checking as scientific understanding of the disease, and appropriate public health measures, evolve. As a consequence, public service announcements must adequately communicate the uncertainly underlying these recommendations, while still encouraging healthy behaviors.
fc5cc0fedf50af659b515f25de57a6c7d841d342	Yu Ping Feng San (YPFS), a Chinese herbal decoction comprising Astragali Radix (AR; Huangqi), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR; Baizhu), and Saposhnikoviae Radix (SR; Fangfeng), has been used clinically to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Previously, we demonstrated a dual role of YPFS in regulating cytokine release in cultured macrophages. In this study, we elucidated the anti-inflammatory effect of YPFS that is mediated through modulating the expression of three key enzymes involved in IBD: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IALP). In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic-inflammation model of cultured murine macrophages, YPFS treatment suppressed the activation of iNOS and COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, application of YPFS in cultured small intestinal enterocytes markedly induced the expression of IALP in a time-dependent manner, which might strengthen the intestinal detoxification system. A duality of YPFS in modulating the expression of iNOS and COX-2 was determined here. The expression of iNOS and COX-2 in macrophages was induced by YPFS, and this activation was partially blocked by the NF-kB-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082, indicating a role of NF-kB signaling. These YPFS-induced changes in gene regulation strongly suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of YPFS are mediated through the regulation of inflammatory enzymes.
a70d334286efa96684bd35e383175063c285ab8b	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent of a devastating pig disease present all over the world. The remarkable genetic variation of PRRSV, makes epidemiological and molecular analysis of circulating viruses highly important to review current diagnostic tools and vaccine efficacy. Monitoring PRRS viruses supports modern herd management by explaining the source of found viruses, either internally or externally from the herd. No epidemiological or molecular study has been published on circulating PRRS-viruses in the Netherlands, since the early nineties. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate circulating PRRS-viruses in the Netherlands in 2014, 2015 and 2016 on a molecular level by sequencing ORF2, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5, ORF6 and ORF7. The results demonstrate that the 74 PRRSV strains belong to PRRSV-1, but the diversity among strains is high, based on nucleotide identity, individual ORF length and phylogenetic trees of individual ORFs. Furthermore, the data presented here show that the phylogenetic topology of some viruses is ORF dependent and suggests recombination. The identity of the strain of interest might be misinterpreted and wrong conclusions may be drawn in a diagnostic and epidemiological perspective, when only ORF5 is analyzed, as performed in many routine sequencing procedures.
0a1f80b50df6a98674b810bab80b88b58152cb13	Background: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a global public health problem. For the fulfillment of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the promotion of preventive care medicine through HAI management is a crucial issue. This study explores the perspectives of Saudi tertiary healthcare workers (HCWs) on HAIs and infection control measures. Methods: Quantitative data were assessed to determine HCWs' knowledge of HAI and their attitudes towards and practice of infection control measures. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from 40 doctors and nurses. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Further, routine sterile procedures in the wards and intensive care units were video recorded, and the footage was discussed by the infection control team and the personnel involved in the videos. This discussion was videographed and transcribed. Both interview data and reflective discussion of the video were analysed using thematic analysis. The quantitative data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression analysis.

656804baa38b83efc3fbbc24cbc19b89e6d778f0	In one more years, we will 'celebrate' an exact centenary of the Spanish flu pandemic. With the rapid evolution of the influenza virus, the possibility of novel pandemic remains ever a concern. This review covers our current knowledge of the influenza A virus: on the role of RNA in translation, replication, what is known of the expressed proteins and the protein products generated from alternative splicing, and on the role of base pairing in RNA structure. We highlight the main events associated with viral entry into the cell, the transcription and replication process, an export of the viral genetic material from the nucleus and the final release of the virus. We discuss the observed potential roles of RNA secondary structure (the RNA base-pairing arrangement) and RNA/RNA interactions in this scheme.
2986796bb44bcd30d7de07831d6532f691a466b1	The world is currently changing due to coronavirus disease 2019 , and the field of dentistry is no stranger to this. The care of patients in the dental office involves very strict biosafety protocols, and patients must be aware of the protection barriers implemented to allow satisfactory, safe dental care. The purpose of this study was to synthesize and analyze the management of the current biosafety standards for dental patients since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. A bibliographic search of the main sources of information including MEDLINE (by means of PubMed), Scopus, Science Direct, SCIELO, and Google Scholar was carried out. Articles published without language restriction, systematic reviews, literature reviews, and observational studies were included. We identified the biosafety measures that must be taken before, during, and after dental practice following the arrival of COVID-19. The main measures include telephone triage, temperature taking on arrival at the office, the organization of the waiting room, washing hands before entering the office, knowing the auxiliary radiographic exams of choice and what type of treatment can be performed, albeit with restrictions. In conclusion, dental patients must comply with all the biosafety measures established by international protection standards and implemented by dentists before, during, and after dental practice to reduce the possibility of COVID-19 infection.
cc860539c12079ee4ef13795d275472ced3344f9	Driven by increasing demands of assisting users to dress and match clothing properly, fashion recommendation has attracted wide attention. Its core idea is to model the compatibility among fashion items by jointly projecting embedding into a unified space. However, modeling the item compatibility in such a category-agnostic manner could barely preserve intra-class variance, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel category-aware metric learning framework, which not only learns the cross-category compatibility notions but also preserves the intra-category diversity among items. Specifically, we define a category complementary relation representing a pair of category labels, e.g., tops-bottoms. Given a pair of item embeddings, we first project them to their corresponding relation space, then model the mutual relation of a pair of categories as a relation transition vector to capture compatibility amongst fashion items. We further derive a negative sampling strategy with non-trivial instances to enable the generation of expressive and discriminative item representations. Comprehensive experimental results conducted on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority and feasibility of our proposed approach.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the function of proteins responsible for formation of the coronavirus replicative organelle. This will be done by identifying domains that are conserved across the order Nidovirales, and by summarizing what is known about function and structure at the level of protein domains.
8c52c61c99757cbcd5a9184cbbe4a0bb654a372f	High Ct-values falling in the grey zone are frequently encountered in SARS-CoV-2 detection by 54 real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and have brought urgent challenges in diagnosis 55 of samples with low viral load. Based on the single-stranded DNA reporter trans-cleavage activity 56 by Cas12a upon target DNA recognition, we create a Specific Enhancer for detection of PCR-57 amplified Nucleic Acids (SENA) to confirm SARS-CoV-2 detection through specifically targeting 58 its rRT-PCR amplicons. SENA is highly sensitive, with its limit of detection being at least 2 59 copies/reaction lower than that of the corresponding rRT-PCR, and highly specific, which 60 identifies both false-negative and false-positive cases in clinic applications. SENA provides 61 effective confirmation for nucleic acid amplification-based molecular diagnosis, and may 62 immediately eliminate the uncertainty problems of rRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 clinic detection. Since December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the infection of the SARS-CoV-68 2, has rapidly spread throughout the world (1), and is now a global pandemic. Till June 1, 2020, 69 the outbreak has affected 216 countries, areas and territories, infected 6 million people, and caused 70 more than 370 thousand of death (2). One of the greatest public health concerns in combating 71 against the pandemic is a prompt response to meet the urgent demand for rapid and accurate 72 diagnosis of the virus. Currently, nucleic acid amplification-based molecular diagnostics (MDx) 73 is the most accurate, fast and affordable and thus the preferred method for diagnosis of SARS- CoV-2 infection, and the real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) kits have been 75 successfully developed by quite a few laboratories and commercial companies (3). However, since 76 its clinical application at least five months ago in China, the diagnostic performance of rRT-PCR 77 for SARS-CoV-2 has brought some urgent challenges, particularly with the frequently encountered 78 high Ct-value designated "grey zone" associated uncertain negative or positive readouts (4-8). 79 Besides of "human error" factors such as misconducted sampling, unqualified reagents and 80 uncalibrated diagnostic equipment, inefficient RT reaction and PCR amplification of clinical 81 samples with very low viral loads are likely the major intrinsic causative factors for the fuzzy rRT-82 PCR readouts and uncertain diagnosis. Although repetitive sampling and assays are implemented 83 for final confirmation of the diagnosis, these "trouble shooting" efforts are time-consuming and 84 may still fail to detect the low viral load samples from some mild or asymptomatic patients, or 85 from the recovering patients, resulting in false-negative diagnosis that may cause serious public 86 concerns in battling against the pandemic (Figure 1). 87 With the characterization of non-specific trans-cleavage activities against single-stranded 88 nucleic acids in several CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, e.g., Cas12, Cas13 and Cas14 (9-15), 89 Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats Diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) technology 90 (16, 17) was established and has been developing rapidly. The underline mechanism for CRISPR-91 Dx, as illustrated by the Cas12a-based HOLMES system for example (18), is based on the efficient 92 trans-cleavage activity against a fluorophore quencher (FQ)-labeled single-stranded DNA reporter 93 by Cas12a triggered upon target DNA recognition, which is guided by a specific CRISPR RNA 94 (crRNA), generating exponentially increasing fluorescence signal within several minutes. With 95 this mechanism, here, we design a Specific Enhancer for detection of PCR-amplified Nucleic 96 Acids (SENA) to improve both the detection sensitivity and specificity against the pre-amplified 97 targeted SARS-CoV-2 genomic fragments (Figure 1). Briefly, the COVID-19 clinic samples are 98 firstly analyzed by the well-established rRT-PCR assays and amplicons with uncertain readouts 99 are then verified by SENA in a physically isolated space, avoiding contamination of the PCR 100 laboratory during pipetting. 101 To prepare appropriate crRNAs for SENA detection, we firstly determined the amplicon 102 sequences from several commercial rRT-PCR kits used in China and then designed specific 103 crRNAs corresponding to each of the distinct amplicons (Table S1 ). Candidate crRNAs were 104 prepared and analyzed in a SENA system comprised of Cas12a, crRNAs, FQ-reporter and the rRT-105 PCR products using templates of either the positive or negative controls, and the best crRNAs, i.e., 106 the lowest fluorescence with the negative control and highest with the positive control, were 107 chosen for further SENA assays (data not shown). If a kit detects more than one gene, e.g., Orf1ab 108 ("abbreviated as O"), E and N genes, corresponding crRNAs were mixed in a SENA system to 109 enhance the detection signal. : medRxiv preprint 147 reading ( Figure S1 and Table S2 ). We also found that in the cases with low concentrations of 148 templates, the rRT-PCR efficiency of the two target genes (i.e., O and N) were different so as the 149 SENA detection (Figures S1 and S2) . In order to verify the existence of specific amplicons of 150 SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in an individual rRT-PCR reaction, all of the amplicons of the replicas 151 with RNA templates ranging from 0.125 to 2 copies/Rx were subjected to next generation 152 sequencing (NGS) analysis. The results were found to be completely consistent with the 153 perspective results of both O-SENA and mix-SENA. In addition, with mix-SENA, not only the 154 signals are generally more significant than that of the O-SENA detection but also may resolve
02276a07ed2aa49afe07d97e7d7286b2b6fea532	During viral infection, virus-derived cytosolic nucleic acids are recognized by host intracellular specific sensors. The efficacy of this recognition system is crucial for triggering innate host defenses, which then stimulate more specific adaptive immune responses against the virus. Recent studies show that signal transduction pathways activated by sensing proteins are positively or negatively regulated by many modulators to maintain host immune homeostasis. However, viruses have evolved several strategies to counteract/evade host immune reactions. These systems involve viral proteins that interact with host sensor proteins and prevent them from detecting the viral genome or from initiating immune signaling. In this review, we discuss key regulators of cytosolic sensor proteins and viral proteins based on experimental evidence.

7dc613e8764f115bbbff4df2b7d31ee5b9c56559	-Gisondi P has nothing to declare. -Conti A has nothing to declare. -Piaserico S has nothing to declare. -Naldi L has nothing to declare. Since the first case of "pneumonia of unknown aetiology" was diagnosed at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China on 30 December 2019, what was recognised thereafter as "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2) has spread over the four continents, causing the respiratory manifestations of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and satisfying the epidemiological criteria for a label of "pandemic." The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having a huge impact on dermatological practice including the marked reduction of face-to-face consultations in favour of teledermatology, the uncertainties concerning the outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients with common inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis receiving immunosuppressive/immunomodulating systemic therapies; the direct involvement of dermatologists in COVID-19 care for patients assistance and new research needs to be addressed. It is not known yet, if skin lesions and derangement of the skin barrier could make it easier for SARS-CoV-2 to transmit via indirect contact; it remains to be defined if specific mucosal or skin lesions are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although some unpublished observations indicate the occurrence of a transient varicelliform exanthema during the early phase of the infection. SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humans that is highly contagious, can spread quickly, and is capable of causing enormous health, economic and societal impacts in any setting. The consequences may continue long after the pandemic resolves, and new management modalities for dermatology may originate from the COVID-19 disaster. Learning from experience may help to cope with future major societal changes.
9795fe49f827ff0654ce919cd8b7450e8a2b40d8	Inflammation in the middle ear mucosa, which can be provoked by different primary factors such as bacterial and viral infection, local allergic reactions and reflux, is the crucial event in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME). Unresolved acute inflammatory responses or defective immunoregulation of middle inflammation can promote chronic inflammatory processes and stimulate the chronic condition of OME. Cytokines are the central molecular regulators of middle ear inflammation and can switch the acute phase of inflammation in the chronic stage and induce molecular Á /pathological processes leading to the histopathological changes accompanying OME. In this review we present cytokines identified in otitis media, immunoregulatory [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, transforming growth factorb]) and allergy associated (IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte Á / macrophage colony-stimulating factor), as crucial molecular regulators, responsible for chronic inflammation in the middle ear and the chronic condition of OME.
0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa	The cellular dispersion and therapeutic control of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of primary brain cancer, depends critically on the migration patterns after surgery and intracellular responses of the individual cancer cells in response to external biochemical cues in the microenvironment. Recent studies have shown that miR-451 regulates downstream molecules including AMPK/CAB39/MARK and mTOR to determine the balance between rapid proliferation and invasion in response to metabolic stress in the harsh tumor microenvironment. Surgical removal of the main tumor is inevitably followed by recurrence of the tumor due to inaccessibility of dispersed tumor cells in normal brain tissue. In order to address this complex process of cell proliferation and invasion and its response to conventional treatment, we propose a mathematical model that analyzes the intracellular dynamics of the miR-451-AMPK-mTOR-cell cycle signaling pathway within a cell. The model identifies a key mechanism underlying the molecular switches between proliferative phase and migratory phase in response to metabolic stress in response to fluctuating glucose levels. We show how up-or down-regulation of components in these pathways affects the key cellular decision to infiltrate or proliferate in a complex microenvironment in the absence and presence of time delays and stochastic noise. Glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain, contribute to the physical structure of the local brain microenvironment but also induce or inhibit glioma invasion by regulating the dynamics of the CSPG receptor LAR as well as the spatiotemporal activation status of resident astrocytes and tumor-associated microglia. Using a multi-scale mathematical model, we investigate a CSPG-induced switch between invasive and noninvasive tumors through the coordination of ECM-cell adhesion and dynamic changes in stromal cells. We show that the CSPG-rich microenvironment is associated with non-PLOS ONE | https://doi.invasive tumor lesions through LAR-CSGAG binding while the absence of glycosylated CSPGs induce the critical glioma invasion. We illustrate how high molecular weight CSPGs can regulate the exodus of local reactive astrocytes from the main tumor lesion, leading to encapsulation of non-invasive tumor and inhibition of tumor invasion. These different CSPG conditions also change the spatial profiles of ramified and activated microglia. The complex distribution of CSPGs in the tumor microenvironment can determine the nonlinear invasion behaviors of glioma cells, which suggests the need for careful therapeutic strategies. Role of CSPG and microenvironment in regulation of glioma invasion PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204865 October 4, 2018 2 / 40 complex, which induces elevated proliferation and decreased cell polarity/migration and (ii) glucose withdrawal leads to down-regulation of miR-451 and up-regulation of AMPK activity, which in turn induces increased cell polarity/migration and reduced cell proliferation. See Fig  1 for a schematic summary of miR-451-AMPK-mTOR core control system [1, 22] . Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major components of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain [23] , are reported to play a pivotal role in inhibiting axon growth and regeneration process in scars after CNS damage [24] . CSPGs are also known to serve as biophysical barriers, preventing brain cells from migrating across the boundary of two adjacent structures during CNS development [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30][31][32]. In CNS tumors, CSPGs may provide a structural foundation and guidance for tumor invasion [33] as well as a physical barrier for cell infiltration like other ECMs. Not surprisingly, this heavy chain of CSPGs has been associated with tumor growth, penetration into neighboring tissues, and angiogenesis [34]. The accumulating interstitial pressure and severe tortuosity in the extracellular space within the tumor [1] due to the high concentration of CSPG ECM are a severe limiting factor for efficient delivery of large therapeutic drugs [35]. Therefore, lowering the CSPG levels by an digestive enzyme was suggested as a way of promoting intratumoral transport of larger therapeutic compounds, making this ECM a potential target for adjuvant therapy [36, 37]. For example, tumor growth and invasion was reduced when these ECM molecules were digested by blocking antibodies against versican [36] or manipulating RNA against phosphacan [38]. CSPG degradation by classical proteases such as MMP-1 and MMP-8 also results in an increase in diffusion and hydraulic conductivity in solid tumors [39]. In oncolytic virus therapy, the diffusion-limiting properties of CSPGs are blamed for low therapeutic anti-tumor efficacy due to the inefficient intratumoral spread of oncolytic viruses within the compact glioma [40, 41]. The CSPG receptor LAR was shown to be involved in promoting or inhibiting tumor invasion [33, 42]. In recent work [42], CSPGs were suggested to be a biochemical indicator of non-invasive tumor and diffusely infiltrating tumor. In the study, they found that (i) a CSPG-rich microenvironment was associated with a strong cell-ECM adhesion and stimulated resident astrocytes to actively escape the CSPG-dense lesions, leading to the self-contained non-invasive tumor surrounded by astrocytes. (ii) Glycosylated CSPGs were not found in invasive GBM [42] and no collective migration of astrocytes was observed. (iii) These CSPG conditions also changed the profile of ramified and activated microglia within and outside the tumor. (iv) CSPG-induced cell-ECM bonding was mediated by its receptor LAR and LAR-CSGAG complex [42]. Integrins usually mediate the cell-matrix interactions by tethering the cell to its surrounding ECM and activating intracellular signalling cascades [43, 44]. Chondroitinase ABC I (Chase-ABC) is an enzyme that can eliminate Chondroitin sulfate glycosoamino glycans from proteoglycans without harmful effects in vivo [40] and has been widely tested for its effect on neuronal regeneration after CNS injury. This bacterial enzyme is known for its 'loosening' effect on the ECM scaffold [24, 45] and studied for enhancement of regeneration of injured axonal tracts. Chase-ABC was also suggested as an attractive target to enhance oncolytic virus (OV) spread in in vivo [40] and in silico [41] experiments and its anti-tumor effect has been proposed in Phase I/II trials for patients treated in Asia [46]. A glioma interacts with its microenvironment such as stromal cells (astrocytes, neurons, microglia, macrophages), ECM, vessels, and chemokines/cytokines by direct and indirect contacts in the tumor-stroma network [42, 43, 47, 48]. M1 and M2 types of microglia were shown to promote glioma cell invasion by exchanging signaling molecules such as CSF-1, . Astrocytes also play a significant role in the progression, aggression, and angiogenesis of CNS tumors [53, 54] .

1e8c2653db450cf88658c723b94f826db4f4e26b	Coronavirus Disease 2019 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be preadapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.
ab9a3f28b3554c8c8031ae417075c75a4269f595	Introduction: Breast carcinosarcoma is rare and aggressive. Data focusing on breast carcinosarcoma is limited. The objective of the study was to describe the clinicopathological features of breast carcinosarcoma and to evaluate post-surgical outcomes. Materials and Methods: All cases about breast carcinosarcoma in China were collected from eligible papers published in Chinese core periodicals between 1990 and 2013 with Keywords of breast carcinosarcoma, or breast cancer, or carcinosarcoma, and metaplastic carcinoma. The survival rates, clinical behavior, and pathological characteristics were analyzed. Results: Mean age of the cohort of 215 patients was 53 years(range, 25~82 years). The tumor size ranged from 2.5cm to 18 cm. The incidence of pathological confirmed lymph node metastases was 30.81%. The epithelial component in a tumor may be composed of invasive ductal carcinoma (84.21%), squamous cell carcinoma (7.89%), lipid-rich carcinoma (6.58%), or adenocarcinoma (1.31%). Mesenchymal components may contain different elements ranging from fibrosarcoma (63.16%) to chondrosarcoma of bone (19.73%), Osteosarcoma (9.21%), Liposarcoma (3.95%) or Leiomyosarcoma (3.95%). 5-year suvival of the breast carcinosarcoma in 149 patients is 62.6%(CI: 54.9%~0.703%). Conclusions: Breast carcinosarcoma is a rare subtype of metaplastic breast cancer. It is characterized by a large tumor size, higher rates of axillary nodal involvement, higher rates of both local and distant recurrence, and is difficult to diagnose with preoperative core needle biopsies. Adjuvant treatment after surgical operation may improve the 5-year OS of patients with breast carcinosarcoma. Purposes: Rectal cancer is a common malignancy and has been a serious threat to human health, with rapidly rising incidence. It is critical to choose appropriate methods for preoperative staging. Our study aimed to compare the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in preoperative local staging of rectal cancer. Methods: From 2013 to 2014, 40 patients including 22 males and 18 females with primary rectal cancer were assessed at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University for preoperative staging by MRI and TRUS examination. The imaging Results were compared with postoperative pathohistological staging to evaluate the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and consistency of MRI and TRUS in assessing depth of invasion (T stage) and locoregional lymph node metastasis (N stage) of rectal cancer. Results: Forty patients with rectal cancer were enrolled in the study. The accuracy of MRI and TRUS in assessing preoperative staging was 65.0 % (kappa consistency test analysis with pathology, (kappa = 0.375). and 65.0 % (kappa = 0.471). In evaluation of lymph node invasion, the diagnostic accuracy of N staging of rectal cancer by MRI and TRUS were 72.5% (kappa = 0.453) and 1 3 50.0% (kappa = -0.008), with sensitivity of 68.2% and 57.1%, specificity of 77.8% and 42.1%, respectively. Conclusions: TRUS was much better than MRI in assessing preoperative T staging of rectal cancer, while MRI has better accuracy than TRUS in assessment of N staging of rectal cancer. To evaluate the short-term efficacy of R-type jejunal interposition and esophagojejunostomy by delta-shaped anastomosis after in totally laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric stump carcinoma. Methods: Analyzed retrospectively were the data of 10 patients with gastric stump cancer from January 2013 to August 2014.All patients received R-type jejunal interposition and esophagojejunostomy by delta-shaped anastomosis after in totally laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric stump carcinoma in our hospital (laparoscope group). As a control, 13 cases were performed laparotomy (laparotomy group). Comparison intraoperative and postoperative indicators between these two groups. All the patients were followed -upostoperatively from 14 months to 21 months. Results: The operation was successfully carried out on all 10 patients (laparoscope group) and no one changed to receive open operation. Compared with laparotomy, the mean operative time was (210.0 ± 30.9 vs 283.9 ± 50.9) minutes, and the time of intraoperative blood loss was (90.0 ± 26.7 vs 277.8 ± 79.1) mL, the number of dissected lymph node was (19.0 ± 3.6 vs 18.8 ± 3.7), the time for leaving bed, first liquid food intake, recovery of gastrointestinal function and hospital stays were (17.3 ± 3.6 vs 75.8 ± 15.7) h, (1.6 ± 0.4 vs 5.7 ± 1.3) d, (3.0 ± 0.8 vs 7.2 ± 1.3) d, (7.6 ± 1.2 vs 20.8 ± 3.9) d. No anastomotic stricture, reflux esophagitis, bleeding, leakage, dumping syndrome or intestinal obstruction was detected in laparoscope group. No patients died perioperatively. All of the cases nutrition situation fine with no choking and sophagus burning. Conclusion: R-type jejunum interposition and Esophagojejunostomy by delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic radical total gastrectomy is safe and feasible. The operation can improve the quality of life and obtain the better near-term therapeutic effect. Laparoscopic-assisted radical gastrectomy on gastric stump cancer have the same radical effects with laparotomy. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility, safety and the clinical outcomes of the robotic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and follow-up data of 113 cases underwent robotic distal gastrectomy from March 2010 to July 2013, and compared with 279 cases after laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer during the same period in our hospital.The surgical safety, postoperative complications, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, survival rate were assessed. Results: Compared with laparoscopic group, the robotic group had less intraoperative blood loss, more lymph nodes dissection(P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio between the two groups. The follow-up data showed that the 1-, 2-and 3-year survival rates were 91.7%, 77.4% and 72.9% in robotic group while they were 91.2%, 76.2% and 70.4% in laparoscopic group, and the difference was not significant. Conclusion: Robotic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer is safe and effective, and it has less harm to the patients, with less intraoperative blood loss, more lymph nodes dissection and quicker postoperative recover than laparoscopic surgery, so it is worthy of popularization and application. Background: Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) has been accepted in early gastric cancer treatment, however, application of LADG in advanced distal gastric cancer (ADGC) remains a controversial topic. In this study, using metaanalysis, we compared the LADG with open distal gastrectomy (ODG) in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer. Methods: PubMed and Cochrane library were electronically searched. All papers published between 2005 and 2013 on the Conclusions: Despite a longer operation time, LAG is a safe technical alternative to OG for AGC with a lower complication rate and enhanced postoperative recovery. Moreover, the oncologic outcomes of LAG for AGC patients were comparable with open approach. Background/Aim: As the morbidity of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) is gradually increased, the alimentary canal reconstruction Method of surgical operation has become a controversy over whether the duodenal passage of food is maintained. To investigate the reasonable operational manner of AEG patient, we explored and improved a new Method of digestive tract reconstruction of antrum-preserving double tract reconstruction (ADTR), and that assessed its efficacy and safety for AEG in terms of long-term survival, complication morbidity, and mortality retrospectively. Methods: 55 caseswere retrospectively collected that consisted of 18 cases underdoing antrum-preserving double tract reconstruction(ADTR) method and 37 cases Roux-Y reconstruction (RY) for adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (Siewert type II, III) at North Sichuan Medical College and divided into two groups.The clinicopathological characteristics, perioperative outcomes, postoperative complications morbidity and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two different reconstruction Methods Results: Basic characteristics, including sex, age, body mass index, Siewert type, pT status, pN stage, and lymph node metastasis, were similar between the two groups. No significant differences were found between the two groups in term of perioperative outcomes (including postoperative hospital stay, operatingtime, intraoperative blood loss), postoperative complications (consisting of anastomosis-related complication, wound infection, respiratory infection, pleural effusion, lymphorrhagia, cholelithiasis). For ADTR group, perioperative recovery index, such as first flatus time (P = 0.002) and time to resume liquid diet (P = 0.001), were faster than that in the RY group. Moreover, the incidence of reflux esophagitis was significantly decreased than RY group (P = 0.048). Postoperative morbidities and mortalities, as for overall postoperative complication, tumor recurrence and metastasis were not significantly different between the two groups. Survival curves plotted by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test presented a common outcome between ADTR group and RY group. Multivariate analysis about treated of ADGC, including retrospective case-control studies and randomized controlled trails, were collected. The RevMan 5.0 software was used for the meta-analysis. Results: There were twelve studies available online, including one randomized controlled trail1-12.These studies consist of 1910 patients, of which 880(46%) were treated with laparoscopic, and 1030(54%) were treated with open distal gastrectomy. The meta-analysis indicated that in comparison with patients who underwent open distal gastrectomy, patients who were treated with LADG had shorter hospital stay, less analgesic requirements and blood loss, less overall complications, including intestinal obstruction, earlier time to liquid ingestion, and less wound infections. Nevertheless, there is no significant difference between LADG and ODG in anastomotic hemorrhage, anastomotic stenosis, duodenal stump leakage, tumor margin, lymph node dissection, mortality, pneumonia or reoperation. And in case of long-term survivals, both OS (overall-survival) and DFS (disease-free survival) showed no significant difference between LADG and ODG. Conclusions: According to this study, LADG is feasible for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, and provides several advantages. Although LADG may associate with longer operation time, patients underwent ODG treatment were weak due to longer hospital stay and slower recurrence. Taken together, LADG should become an alternative approach for the treatment of ADGC. Background: Laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy(LAG) is one of the most accepted procedure for early gastric cancer(EGC). However, currently the utility of the procedure for advanced gastric cancer(AGC) still remain controversial. So, a meta-analysis of high-quality clinical studies was performed to compare LAG and open gastrectomy(OG) for AGC. Methods: All randomized controlled trials(RCTs) and highquality retrospective case-control studies published in English from January 1994 to April 2014 that compared LAG and OG were identified through PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and the controlled Trials Registry. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0 software(Cochrane Library). Results: Twenty studies were included in final pooled analysis, 2RCTs and 17 NRCTs, compromising 3409 patients (1640LAG, 1709OG). LAG was associated with longer operative time (P < 0.001) and lower overall complications (P = 0.001), estimated blood loss (P < 0.001) and hospital stay (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between two groups in number of lymph node dissection (P = 0.65), overall complication (P = 0.86), a 5-year overall survival rate (P = 0.53) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (P = 0.07).
580e02703de579e643b40d59d478c8627cc559b8	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and sent all countries scrambling to review emergency healthcare provisions. There is global evidence of each nation struggling to effectively manage the number of people being diagnosed with the virus. These are testing times which have not been experienced in recent
09ccab35fa88ecf476d44a904856c0cbad7e0c54	Background: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the standard of care in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other inflammatory rheumatic diseases and potentially for the treatment in COVID-19 patients. Determination of HCQ for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be performed in whole blood (WB), serum, and plasma. Direct comparisons of WB, serum, and plasma levels of HCQ in patients with SLE have not previously been reported. We describe a method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using liquid chromatography-highresolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and compare the suitability of the three sample matrices. Methods: A method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using LC-HRMS was developed, validated, and applied for the determination of HCQ levels in WB, serum, and plasma from 26 SLE patients. The reproducibility of the method, in the three matrices, was evaluated using quality control samples and repeated preparations and measurements of patient samples. The performance of the developed method for HCQ measurement in serum was further evaluated by comparison with two previously reported extraction methods. Results: The performance of the presented method demonstrated high accuracy and precision. A large range of HCQ concentrations was observed for the SLE patients in all three matrices (WB, serum, and plasma). The mean levels in WB were approximately two-fold the levels in serum and plasma (813 ng/mL compared to 436 ng/mL and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Spiked quality controls showed high reproducibility for all matrices (coefficient of variation, CV, approx. 5%), whereas in patient samples, equally high-precision was only found using WB as the matrix (CV 3%). The CV for serum and plasma was 14% and 39%, respectively. Two alternative methods applied to serum samples did not demonstrate improved precision. Conclusions: A LC-HRMS method for the measurement of HCQ in human blood was developed and validated. Whole blood was found to be the superior sample matrix in terms of sample reproducibility. Thus, whole blood samples should be used for HCQ analysis when patients are monitored for HCQ treatment effects. The assay is in clinical use to monitor levels of HCQ in patients.
67f2ba141bcc1bffbd19f77b1aedde25a0f0022b	Background: Hospitals are cornerstones for health care in a community and must continue to function in the face of a disaster. The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) is a method by which the hospital operates when an emergency is declared. Hospitals are often ill equipped to evaluate the strengths and vulnerabilities of their own management systems before the occurrence of an actual disaster. The main objective of this study was to measure the decision making performance according to HICS job actions sheets using tabletop exercises. Methods: This observational study was conducted between May 1st 2008 and August 31st 2009. Twenty three Iranian hospitals were included. A tabletop exercise was developed for each hospital which in turn was based on the highest probable risk. The job action sheets of the HICS were used as measurements of performance. Each indicator was considered as 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with the HICS. Fair performance was determined as < 40%; intermediate as 41-70%; high as 71-100% of the maximum score of 192. Descriptive statistics, T-test, and Univariate Analysis of Variance were used. Results: None of the participating hospitals had a hospital disaster management plan. The performance according to HICS was intermediate for 83% (n = 19) of the participating hospitals. No hospital had a high level of performance. The performance level for the individual sections was intermediate or fair, except for the logistic and finance sections which demonstrated a higher level of performance. The public hospitals had overall higher performances than university hospitals (P = 0.04). Conclusions: The decision making performance in the Iranian hospitals, as measured during table top exercises and using the indicators proposed by HICS was intermediate to poor. In addition, this study demonstrates that the HICS job action sheets can be used as a template for measuring the hospital response. Simulations can be used to assess preparedness, but the correlation with outcome remains to be studied.
2def22f387794a0a8bc75678132663f4d253d39c	Information-centric networking (ICN) has gained attention from network research communities due to its capability of efficient content dissemination. In-network caching function in ICN plays an important role to achieve the design motivation. However, many researchers on in-network caching have focused on where to cache rather than how to cache: the former is known as contents deployment in the network and the latter is known as cache replacement in an ICN element. Although, the cache replacement has been intensively researched in the context of web-caching and content delivery network previously, the conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to ICN due to the fine granularity of cacheable items in ICN, which eventually changes the access patterns. In this paper, we argue that ICN requires a novel cache replacement algorithm to fulfill the requirements in the design of high performance ICN element. Then, we propose a novel cache replacement algorithm to satisfy the requirements named Compact CLOCK with Adaptive Replacement (Compact CAR), which can reduce the consumption of cache memory to one-tenth compared to conventional approaches.
b3c0b4301660876a9a41946cc6b4aa200aad046e	We aimed to examine independent predictive factors for the severity and survival of COVID-19 disease, from routine blood parameters, especially the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) ratio. A total of 139 patients with COVID-19 were investigated at Siirt State Hospital. According to the disease severity, the patients were categorized as three groups (moderate: 85, severe: 54, and critical: 20). Then, patients were divided into two groups: nonsevere (moderate) and severe (severe and critical). Demographic, clinical data, and routine blood parameters were analyzed. In multivariate model adjusted for potential confounders BUN/Cr ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-2.40; P = .002) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.20-4.30; P < .001) were independent predictive factors for disease severity. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model BUN/Cr ratio (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05; P = .030), and NLR (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06-1.30; P = .020) were independent predictors for survival of COVID-19 disease. The optimal thresholds of the BUN/Cr ratio at 33.5 and 51.7 had the superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, area under the curve (AUC) were 0.98 and 0.95, respectively. The optimal thresholds of NLR at 3.27 and 5.72 had a superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, AUC were 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. BUN/Cr and NLR are independent predictors for COVID-19 patient severity and survival. Routine evaluation of BUN/Cr and NLR can help identify highrisk cases with COVID-19.

698174035746c185ce55489b4a345026d82dcc42	The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most important swine pathogens and often serves as an entry door for other viral or bacterial pathogens, of which Streptococcus suis is one of the most common. Pre-infection with PRRSV leads to exacerbated disease caused by S. suis infection. Very few studies have assessed the immunological mechanisms underlying this higher susceptibility. Since antigen presenting cells play a major role in the initiation of the immune response, the in vitro transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and monocytes in the context of PRRSV and S. suis co-infection was investigated. BMDCs were found to be more permissive than monocytes to PRRSV infection; S. suis phagocytosis by PRRSV-infected BMDCs was found to be impaired, whereas no effect was found on bacterial intracellular survival. Transcription profile analysis, with a major focus on inflammatory genes, following S. suis infection, with and without pre-infection with PRRSV, was then performed. While PRRSV pre-infection had little effect on monocytes response to S. suis infection, a significant expression of several pro-inflammatory molecules was observed in BMDCs pre-infected with PRRSV after a subsequent infection with S. suis. While an additive effect could be observed for CCL4, CCL14, CCL20, and IL-15, a distinct synergistic up-regulatory effect was observed for IL-6, CCL5 and TNF-α after co-infection. This increased pro-inflammatory response by DCs could participate in the exacerbation of the disease observed during PRRSV and S. suis co-infection.
e2829235b38ce9927537136e2310e01bf89bbcc3	Porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV has been identified from suckling piglets with severe diarrhea in southern China in 2017. The SADS-CoV genome shares~95% identity to that of bat αcoronavirus HKU2, suggesting that SADS-CoV may have emerged from a natural reservoir in bats. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å resolution, respectively. We systematically compare the domains of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes, showing that the S1 subunit N-and C-terminal domains of HKU2/SADS-CoV are ancestral domains in the evolution of coronavirus spike proteins. The connecting region after the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit of HKU2/SADS-CoV adopts a unique conformation. These results structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2/SADS-CoV and β-coronavirus spikes and provide insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.
e0b9e787564d9acd42c03f0e0115dc9d58e508b3	Niclosamide is an oral antihelminthic drug used to treat parasitic infections in millions of people worldwide. However recent studies have indicated that niclosamide may have broad clinical applications for the treatment of diseases other than those caused by parasites. These diseases and symptoms may include cancer, bacterial and viral infection, metabolic diseases such as Type II diabetes, NASH and NAFLD, artery constriction, endometriosis, neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, sclerodermatous graft-versus-host disease, and systemic sclerosis. Among the underlying mechanisms associated with the drug actions of niclosamide are uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and modulation of Wnt/β-catenin, mTORC1, STAT3, NF-κB and Notch signaling pathways. Here we provide a brief overview of the biological activities of niclosamide, its potential clinical applications, and its challenges for use as a new therapy for systemic diseases.
587cd9817ce5be8ee1892b5d0fd269612f1c3c0c	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, a type I membrane-bound protein, is essential for the viral attachment to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By screening 312 controlled Chinese medicinal herbs supervised by Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy at Taiwan, we identified that three widely used Chinese medicinal herbs of the family Polygonaceae inhibited the interaction of SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2. The IC 50 values for Radix et Rhizoma Rhei (the root tubers of Rheum officinale Baill.), Radix Polygoni multiflori (the root tubers of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb.), and Caulis Polygoni multiflori (the vines of P. multiflorum Thunb.) ranged from 1 to 10 g/ml. Emodin, an anthraquinone compound derived from genus Rheum and Polygonum, significantly blocked the S protein and ACE2 interaction in a dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited the infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells. These findings suggested that emodin may be considered as a potential lead therapeutic agent in the treatment of SARS.
6209bb15edbdcc8d2c9bdd5a29e97231a9744e02	With increased globalisation comes the likelihood that infectious disease appearing in one country will spread rapidly to another, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) being a recent example. However, although SARS infected some 10,000 individuals, killing around 1000, it did not lead to the devastating health impact that many feared, but a rather disproportionate economic impact. The disproportionate scale and nature of this impact has caused concern that outbreaks of more serious disease could cause catastrophic impacts on the global economy. Understanding factors that led to the impact of SARS might help to deal with the possible impact and management of such other infectious disease outbreaks. In this respect, the role of risk-its perception, communication and management-is critical. This paper looks at the role that risk, and especially the perception of risk, its communication and management, played in driving the economic impact of SARS. It considers the public and public health response to SARS, the role of the media and official organisations, and proposes policy and research priorities for establishing a system to better deal with the next global infectious disease outbreak. It is concluded that the potential for the rapid spread of infectious disease is not necessarily a greater threat than it has always been, but the effect that an outbreak can have on the economy is, which requires further research and policy development. r
633715b2acfa849d613285b7a01531072c2b3422	Background: Ebolaviruses induce lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in humans and non-human primates, with the exceptions of Reston virus (RESTV), which is not pathogenic for humans. In human VHF cases, extensive analyses of the humoral immune responses in survivors and non-survivors have shown that the IgG responses to nucleoprotein (NP) and other viral proteins are associated with asymptomatic and survival outcomes, and that the neutralizing antibody responses targeting ebolaviruses glycoprotein (GP 1,2 ) are the major indicator of protective immunity. On the other hand, the immune responses in non-human primates, especially naturally infected ones, have not yet been elucidated in detail, and the significance of the antibody responses against NP and GP 1,2 in RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the humoral immune responses of cynomolgus macaque by using serum specimens obtained from the RESTV epizootic in 1996 in the Philippines to expand our knowledge on the immune responses in naturally RESTV-infected non-human primates. Results: The antibody responses were analyzed using IgG-ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), and a pseudotyped VSV-based neutralizing (NT) assay. Antigen-capture (Ag)-ELISA was also performed to detect viral antigens in the serum specimens. We found that the anti-GP 1,2 responses, but not the anti-NP responses, closely were correlated with the neutralization responses, as well as the clearance of viremia in the sera of the RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. Additionally, by analyzing the cytokine/chemokine concentrations of these serum specimens, we found high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IFNγ, IL8, IL-12, and MIP1α, in the convalescent phase sera. Conclusions: These results imply that both the antibody response to GP 1,2 and the proinflammatory innate responses play significant roles in the recovery from RESTV infection in cynomolgus macaques.
27930c8860e6f54a47465fc9f916e15d1db432dd	Correspondence: Evgeniia Mustafaeva BMC Proceedings 2020, 14(Suppl 3):O1 Melanoma, a cancer of melanocytes, is one of the most common cancers in the world. In living tissues, it grows surrounded by a 3D microenvironment, which provides physical support and determines disease progression and prognosis. The aim of this project was to determine how different melanoma cell lines M14 and SK-MEL-28 behave, grow and expand in 3D in vitro models using collagen-based scaffolds. Collagen scaffolds contained either chondroitin to mimic skin tissue, hyaluronic acid or nano-hydroxyapatite to mimic bone tissue. All tested scaffolds were populated with melanoma M14 and SK-MEL-28 cells that were left to grow for 28 days. Scaffold infiltrations by cells were assessed on day 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Populated scaffolds were then processed with a tissue processor, embedded in paraffin wax, sliced up with a microtome and stained with H&E followed by bright field microscopy. The images were put together in chronological order to see the growth progression. Both SK-MEL-28 and M14 cell lines have demonstrated most penetration when grown on chondroitin scaffolds, followed by hyaluronic acid scaffolds. Cells grown on nano-hydroxyapatite scaffolds showed the least colonisation and tended to accumulate around the edges of the scaffold. M14 cells growing on chondroitin scaffolds demonstrated rapid infiltration when compared with SK-MEL28 cells probably due to intrinsic aggressive growth properties. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time the ability of collagen-based scaffolds to support melanoma cell growth and colonisation. Our findings can aid the development of a 3D in vitro scaffold-based platform to study melanoma biology.

02bf81750f4254cb1fbb2d3d9238bb9f459fa096	Respiratory disorders are the leading cause of death in persons with both acute and chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Pneumonia occurs in 50% of patients with acute tetraplegia during acute hospitalization and rehabilitation [1] . Respiratory disorders account for 28% of deaths in the first year after injury and 22% of deaths in later years [2] . In patients who survive for at least 24 hours after injury, pneumonia or influenza causes 16.5% of all deaths [3] . This contrasts with that of the general population of the United States, for which pneumonia and influenza account for only 2.5% of deaths and the two diseases in combination are the eighth leading cause of death [4] . The standardized mortality ratio, a measure that adjusts for age, sex, and race, indicates that the rate of fatal pneumonia is elevated by a factor of 37 for people with SCI; persons with complete tetraplegia die from pneumonia at a rate that is 150 times higher than a matched population without SCI [2] . Respiratory disorders are also a leading cause of rehospitalization after SCI [5] . Based on United States (US) Model SCI Systems (MSCIS) data,
82cbd1ae14d9f2b48754823adcbbbc106ea551f5	The first patient with COVID-19 was reported in Iraq on 24 February 2020 for the Iranian student came from Iran. As of 24 May 2020, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections reached 4469, with 160 deaths and 2738 patients were recovered from the infection. Significant public health strategies have been implemented by the authorities to contain the outbreak nationwide. Nevertheless however, the number of cases is still rising dramatically. Here, we aim to describe a comprehensive and epidemiological study of all cases diagnosed in Iraq by 24 May 2020. Most of the cases were recorded in Baghdad followed by Basra and Najaf. About 45% of the patients were female (with 31% deaths of the total cases) and 55% were male (with 68% deaths of the total cases). Most cases are between the ages of (20-59) years old, and (30-39) years are the most affected range (19%) Approximately (8%) of cases are children under 10 years old. Iraq has shown a cure rate lower than those reported by Iran, Turkey and Jordan; and higher than Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Healthcare workers represented about (5%) of the total confirmed cases. These findings enable us to understand COVID-19 epidemiology and prevalence in Iraq that can alert the our community to the risk of this novel coronavirus and serve as a baseline for future studies.
fc9a8ef33d27d4c87526b2006b15b84885bc2564	Resting naive CD8 + T cells have an astounding capacity to react to pathogens by massive expansion and differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells that migrate to all corners of the body to clear the infection. The initial interaction with antigen-presenting cells in the central lymphoid organs drives an orchestrated program of differentiation aimed at producing sufficient numbers of effectors to get the job done without resulting in clonal exhaustion. Interactions with antigen-presenting cells and other immune cells continue at the site of infection to regulate further on-site expansion and differentiation, all with the goal of protecting the host with minimal bystander tissue damage. Here we review recent advances in CD8 + T cell recognition of antigen in lymphoid as well as in nonlymphoid tissues in the periphery, and how CD8 + T cell expansion and differentiation are controlled in these contexts.

f1e52f9f4eb34a76dd9652d49e72b6ff99309009	The objective of this study was to compare infusion-related reactions and outcomes of using subcutaneous (subQ) alemtuzumab versus intravenous (i.v.) alemtuzumab as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantations. Outcomes include incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV)/Epstein-Barr (EBV) viremia, development of CMV disease or post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, fatal infections, acute and chronic GVHD, time to engraftment, relapse rate, and survival. We conducted a retrospective study of all adult matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantations patients who received fludarabine/melphalan with subQ or i.v. alemtuzumab in combination with tacrolimus as part of their conditioning for unrelated donor transplantation at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center from January 1, 2012 to March 21, 2014. Alemtuzumab was administered at a total cumulative dose of 100 mg (divided over days À7 to À3). Forty-six patients received an unrelated donor stem cell transplantation with fludarabine/melphalan and either subQ (n ¼ 26) or i.v. (n ¼ 20) alemtuzumab in combination with tacrolimus. Within the evaluable population, 130 subQ and 100 i.v. alemtuzumab doses were administered. For the primary outcome, !grade 2 infusion-related reactions occurred in 11 (8%) versus 25 (25%) infusions in the subQ and i.v. cohorts, respectively (P ¼ .001). Overall, 12 injections (9%) in the subQ arm versus 26 infusions (26%) in the i.v. arm experienced an infusion-related reaction of any grade (P ¼ .001). There were no significant differences between the subQ and i.v. arms in rates of reactivation of CMV/EBV, development of CMV disease or post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, fatal infections, acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, or survival. Subcutaneous administration of alemtuzumab for GVHD prophylaxis was associated with fewer infusion-related reactions compared with i.v. administration in the SCT setting. Incidences of acute and chronic GVHD were similar between both arms. There was also no difference in reactivation of CMV/EBV viremia, development of CMV disease or post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, fatal infections, relapse, or survival.

The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of exopolymers from Aureobasidium pullulans (EAP) on the incidence of colds and flu in healthy adults. Methods. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at the onset of the influenza season. A total of 76 subjects (30-70 years of age) were recruited from the general population. The subjects were instructed to take one capsule per day of either EAP or a placebo for a period of 8 weeks. The duration of cold and flu symptoms, a primary variable in assessing effectiveness, and serum cytokine levels as well as WBC counts as secondary variables were also evaluated. Results. EAP was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the duration of cold and flu symptoms, a primary variable in assessing effectiveness. Although cold and flu symptom levels were not significantly different at a significance level of 5%, the cold and flu symptom levels of the EAP group were less severe compared to the placebo group. No statistically significant changes of serum cytokine levels as well as WBC counts were observed. Conclusion. The results showed that EAP is a useful pharmaceutical and functional food material for preventing and treating colds and flu.
1a43a0980cd9d8025ff37de176287af5cd9fa0ff	Objectives: A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease due to a novel betacoronavirus, human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), has emerged recently. HCoV-EMC is phylogenetically closely related to Tylonycteris-bat-coronavirus-HKU4 and Pipistrellus-bat-coronavirus-HKU5 in Hong Kong. We conducted a seroprevalence study on archived sera from 94 game-food animal handlers at a wild life market, 28 SARS patients, and 152 healthy blood * Corresponding author. Journal of Infection (2013) 67, 130e140 OC43; HKU1; Cross-reactive; Antibody; Neutralization; Seroprevalence donors in Southern China to assess the zoonotic potential and evidence for intrusion of HCoV-EMC and related viruses into humans. Methods: Anti-HCoV-EMC and anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected using screening indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and confirmatory neutralizing antibody tests. Results: Two (2.1%) animal handlers had IF antibody titer of !1:20 against both HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV with neutralizing antibody titer of <1:10. No blood donor had antibody against either virus. Surprisingly, 17/28 (60.7%) of SARS patients had significant IF antibody titers with 7/28 (25%) having anti-HCoV-EMC neutralizing antibodies at low titers which significantly correlated with that of HCoV-OC43. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated a significant B-cell epitope overlapping the heptad repeat-2 region of Spike protein. Virulence of SARS-CoV over other betacoronaviruses may boost cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against other betacoronaviruses. Conclusions: Convalescent SARS sera may contain cross-reactive antibodies against other betacoronaviruses and confound seroprevalence study for HCoV-EMC.
d1795cb6e9ed22078b148fe4837d6aa00ac75d5c	The Coronavirus pandemic has created unprecedented strain on medical resources at health care institutions around the world. At many institutions, this has resulted in efforts to prioritize cases with an attempt to balance the acuity of medical needs with available resources. Here, we provide a framework for institutions and governments to help adjudicate treatment allocations to patients with neuro-oncologic disease.
4878d966944fb0b66d96fec7b7dff3f79194f26d	Influenza A virus (IAV) can infect host cells via pH-dependent endocytosis. It is generally accepted that hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated recognition of cell surface sialic acid (SIA) is the first step in initiating IAV infection, however surprisingly little is known regarding the identity of specific receptors and/or coreceptors that mediate virus internalization. SIA structures do not exhibit signalling capacity but may act as attachment factors, promoting interactions with specific transmembrane receptors for virus uptake. Alternatively, recognition of critical SIA residues expressed by transmembrane receptors may be required to initiate virus entry. As SIA-independent entry and infection has also been reported 1,2 , it is possible that some receptors can bind IAV and signal independently of SIA, although attachment to SIA may concentrate virions at the cell surface and augment this mode of entry. The sorting of IAV into particular entry pathways will be determined by specific adaptor protein(s) that bind to the cytoplasmic tails of IAV receptors and co-receptors, activating intracellular signalling proteins for subsequent internalization of virus. While little is known regarding the specific entry receptors for IAV expressed by epithelial cells, significant progress has been made towards identifying receptors that play a role in infectious entry of IAV into macrophages (MΦ ) and dendritic cells (DC). C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins that recognize glycans expressed on IAV glycoproteins and a number of distinct CLRs have been implicated in promoting IAV infection (reviewed in 3 ). Previous studies from our group implicated the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) and the macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL)-1 in infectious entry of IAV into mouse macrophages (MΦ ) 4-6 . Of the human CLRs, expression of DC-SIGN (DC209) and/or L-SIGN (DC-SIGNR and CD209L) by transfected cell lines 7-9 or primary cells 7,9 has also been associated with enhanced susceptibility to IAV infection. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are tetrameric type II transmembrane CLRs expressing Ca 2+ -dependent (C-type) carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) which bind preferentially to mannose-rich oligosaccharides (reviewed in 10 ). Despite their similarities, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN differ with respect to tissue distribution. DC-SIGN is expressed by MΦ and DC subsets throughout the body whereas L-SIGN tends to be expressed by non-immune cells. In the respiratory tract, DC-SIGN is expressed by human alveolar MΦ and subpopulations of lung DCs 11,12 , whereas L-SIGN is expressed by bronchiolar epithelial cells, type II alveolar cells and endothelial cells of the
ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6	The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.
93db6b6316e40104e3ece29882993702d0d22756	Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are ubiquitous polypeptides expressed in all living organisms that participate in several basic cellular processes, including protein folding, from which their denomination as molecular chaperones originated. There are several HSPs, including HSPA5, also known as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) or binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) that is an ER resident involved in the folding of polypeptides during their translocation into this compartment prior to the transition to the Golgi network. HSPA5 is detected on the surface of cells or secreted into the extracellular environment. Surface HSPA5 has been proposed to have various roles, such as receptor-mediated signal transduction, a co-receptor for soluble ligands, as well as a participant in tumor survival, proliferation, and resistance. Recently, surface HSPA5 has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2. In spite of these observations, the association of HSPA5 within the plasma membrane is still unclear. To gain information about this process, we studied the interaction of HSPA5 with liposomes made of different phospholipids. We found that HSPA5 has a high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphoserine (POPS) and cardiolipin (CL). The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HSPA5 were independently capable of interacting with negatively charged phospholipids, but to a lesser extent than the full-length protein, suggesting that both domains are required for the maximum insertion into membranes. Interestingly, we found that the interaction of HSPA5 with negatively charged liposomes promotes an oligomerization process via intermolecular disulfide bonds in which the N-terminus end of the protein plays a critical role.
f6d4bdeaa2cdb3373313bd4ff5b9cd942aa2424c	Near infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometrics was investigated for the fast determination of total organic carbon (TOC) and soluble solids contents (SSC) of Tanreqing injection intermediates. The NIR spectra were collected in transflective mode, and the TOC and SSC reference values were determined with Multi N/C UV HS analyzer and loss on drying method. The samples were divided into calibration sets and validation sets using the Kennard-Stone (KS) algorithm. The Dixon test, leverage and studentized residual test were studied for the sample outlier analysis. The selection of wavebands, spectra pretreated method and the number of latent variables were optimized to obtain better results. The quantitative calibration models were established with 3 different PLS regression algorithms, named linear PLS, non-linear PLS and concentration weighted PLS, and the net result was defined as the average of the predicted values of the different calibration models. The overall results indicated that the presented method is more powerful than single multivariable regression method, characterized by higher mean recovery rate (MRR) of the validation set, and can be used for the rapid determination of TOC and SSC values of Tanreqing injection intermediates, which are two important quality indicators for the process monitoring.
e387c63ce94991fdabe9e0baf35d32a2d9f4dd73	Control of the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic requires accurate laboratory testing to identify infected individuals, while also clearing essential staff to continue work. At the current time a number of RT-PCR tests have been developed to identify SARS-CoV-2, targeting multiple regions in the viral genome. In comparison to other RNA viruses the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is moderate, however given the large number of transmission chains it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for mutations that might compromise these tests. Here we report the identification of a C-to-T transition at position 26340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome which is associated with failure of the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 E-gene assay. This variant was detected in four health care workers from the same team. Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed all four to carry genetically identical viruses. Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this mutation has arisen independently on three occasions. This work highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the emergence of SNPs which might adversely affect the RT-PCRs used in diagnostics. Additionally, it argues that two regions in the SARS-CoV-2 should be targeted in RT-PCRs to avoid false negatives.
c6e1344096d93a243ff2c87f14a7d526c48d59cd	Objectives To report an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease from Meghalaya, in the north east India, from January 2008 through June 2009. Methods Retrospective review of case sheets was done. One hundred ten patients with invasive meningococcal disease were included for the study. Results Of the total patients, 61.8 % were boys and 38.2 % were girls (boy to girl ratio01.62:1). The average age of presentation was 8.48 ± 5.09 y. Meningococcal meningitis was seen in 61.8 % of cases, meningococcemia in 20 % and 18.2 % had both. Fever was the most common manifestation (100 %) followed by meningeal signs (78.2 %), headache (56.4 %), vomiting (53.6 %), shock (38.2 %), low Glasgow coma scale (GCS) (25.5 %), purpura and rashes (23.6 %), seizures (9.1 %), abdominal symptoms (4.5 %), irritability and excessive crying (4.5 %) and bulging anterior fontanalle (23 %) in those below 18 mo of age. Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) was the most common complication (28.2 %) followed by coagulopathy (16.4 %), hepatopathy (10 %), herpes labialis (9.1 %), syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) (8 %), pneumonia (7 %), arthritis (6 %), purpura fulminans, respiratory failure, sixth nerve palsy and diabetes insipidus in 4.5 % each, subdural empyema, optic neuritis, ARDS and ARF in 1.8 % each, cerebral salt wasting syndrome, third nerve palsy, cerebritis and hearing impairment in 0.9 % each. Culture was positive in 35.5 %. Patients were treated initially with ceftriaxone and dexamethasone but later on with chloramphenicol due to clinical drug resistance. Mortality was 6.4 %. Conclusions This is the first epidemic report of invasive meningococcal disease from the north east India. Chloramphenicol acts well in areas with penicillin or cephalosporin resistance. Mortality reduces significantly with early diagnosis and prompt intervention.
12797e9c799acbdfcc92ebba87dd6da38e07be65	Diseases may play major roles in the conservation of endangered species. Although the threat of disease received extensive consideration and influenced research and management activities governing the endangered black-footed f m e t (Mustela nigripes) in Wyoming, a canine distemper epizootic in 1985 severely affected a captive breeding program and led to extirpation of the species from the wild. This recent example of the catastrophic effect of epizootic disease in an endangered species is described in an historical context In addition, examples are given of disease further endangering other rare species, including Mauritius pink pigeon, Pere David's deer, cranes, maned wolves, native Hawaiian birak, cheetahs, and others.
7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6	There is a growing need for information regarding the recent coronavirus disease of 2019 . We present a comprehensive report of Covid-19 patients in Iran. One hundred hospitalized patients with Covid-19 were studied. Data on potential source of exposure, demographic, clinical, and paraclinical features, therapy outcome, and post-discharge follow-up were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 58 years, and the majority of the patients (72.7%) were above 50 years of age. Fever was present in 45.2% of the patients on admission. The most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (74%) and cough (68%). Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), lymphocytopenia (74.2 %) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground-glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in CT scans. The administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages. Of the 70 discharged patients, 40% had symptom relapse, (8.6%) were readmitted to the hospital, and 3 patients (4.3%) died. This report demonstrates a heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations in patients affected with Covid-19. The most common presenting symptoms are non-specific, so attention should be made on broader testing, especially in age groups with the greatest risk and younger individuals who can serve as carriers of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (in younger age group) can be potential treatment options. Finally, patients discharged from the hospital should be followed up because of potential symptom relapse.
b474f9bee005c10021ee5bd7976b615812a18041	Another aspect that should be considered is the difficulty to perform CT-scan in many hospitals due to the emergency that several countries are facing. Not all ICU patients who deserve a chest CT scan for suspected pulmonary embolism are promptly diagnosed and indirect objective examinations, i.e., echocardiography or lung ultrasonography do not help. It may be that an unexpected worsening of the respiratory function together with a sudden increase of D-dimer levels are suggestive of pulmonary embolism, but this remains to be demonstrated. To date, D-dimer levels help in predicting the severity of the disease and patient's prognosis, as patients with high levels at admission die more than those with normal levels [7]. With this panorama and all the uncertainties of care of ICU patients with COVID-19, we believe Journal Pre-proof
162e2d7f1b49b31893a155877f8699fb8a87082e	The coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome contains a small envelope protein, E, with putative involvement in host apoptosis and virus morphogenesis. To perform these functions, it has been suggested that protein E can form a membrane destabilizing transmembrane (TM) hairpin, or homooligomerize to form a TM pore. Indeed, in a recent study we reported that the a-helical putative transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms several SDS-resistant TM interactions: a dimer, a trimer, and two pentameric forms. Further, these interactions were found to be evolutionarily conserved. Herein, we have studied multiple isotopically labeled ETM peptides reconstituted in model lipid bilayers, using the orientational parameters derived from infrared dichroic data. We show that the topology of ETM is consistent with a regular TM a-helix. Further, the orientational parameters obtained unequivocally correspond to a homopentameric model, by comparison with previous predictions. We have independently confirmed that the full polypeptide of E protein can also aggregate as pentamers after expression in Escherichia coli. This interaction must be stabilized, at least partially, at the TM domain. The model we report for this pentameric a-helical bundle may explain some of the permabilizing properties of protein E, and should be the basis of mutagenesis efforts in future functional studies.
ac9b7ebd74325c3d7280a2a8b0ebd8b57632137e	Background: EPs R 7630 is a proprietary aqueous-ethanolic extract from roots of Pelargonium sidoides DC and has been demonstrated to dispose among others of antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and tissue-protective activity. It is an approved medicinal product in more than 50 countries for the treatment of airway infections such as acute bronchitis, common cold, and sinusitis. Purpose: While the pharmacological effects of EPs R 7630 have extensively been evaluated in diverse in vitro test systems, the number of publications reporting results from in vivo models is limited. Study design: In the present study antitussive, secretolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects of EPs R 7630 were assessed in animal experiments following oral administration at human equivalent doses. Methods: Antitussive effects were evaluated using ammonia-and citric acid-induced models of cough in mice (20, 40, 120 mg/kg) and guinea pigs (10, 20, 45 mg/kg), respectively. For the determination of secretolytic activity tracheobronchial secretion of intraperitoneally injected phenol red was determined in mice, while antiinflammatory action was assessed in an acute bacterial bronchitis model in rats. Results: A significant and dose-dependent reduction of cough frequency was observed in both cough models, which was accompanied by a prolongation of cough latency time. Similarly, the extract exerted a marked secretolytic activity in mice. Induction of acute bacterial bronchitis caused characteristic histopathological changes in lung tissue adjacent to trachea and bronchi. The degree of these lesions was significantly reduced in rats treated with EPs R 7630 at doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg. This protective effect at least partially seems to be mediated by an up-regulation of superoxide dismutase and a subsequent protective effect against oxidative stress as indicated by a reduced serum level of malondialdehyde. Conclusion: The present data further support the therapeutic use of EPs R 7630 in respiratory tract infections and provide a basis for detailed studies on its bioactive constituents as well as their in vivo mode of action.

This pandemic extremely challenged the existing health care systems and caused severe mental distress to frontline healthcare workers. The authors describe the infrastructure of the team and a novel model of peer support and crisis intervention that utilized a popular social media application on smartphone. Such a model for intervention that can be used elsewhere in the face of current global pandemic, or future disaster response.
cf3aabf42f361d630f238d5ed6be25fc235a3771	The recent pandemic triggered by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus boosted the demand for medical services and protective equipment, causing the generation rate of infectious medical waste (IMW) to increase rapidly. Designing an efficient and reliable IMW reverse logistics network in this situation can help to control the spread of the virus. Studies on this issue are limited, and minimization of costs and the risks associated with the operations of this network consisting of different types of medical waste generation centers (MWGC) are rarely considered. In this research, a linear programming model with three objective functions is developed to minimize the total costs, the risk associated with the transportation and treatment of IMW, and the maximum amount of uncollected waste in MWGCs. Also, multiple functions that calculate the amount of generated waste according to the parameters of the current epidemic outbreak are proposed. Revised Multi-Choice Goal Programming method is employed to solve the multiobjective model, and a real case study from Iran is examined to illustrate the validation of the proposed model. The final results show that the model can create a balance between three considered objectives by determining the flow between centers, deciding to install two new temporary treatment centers, and allowing the network to only have uncollected waste in the first Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 two periods in some MWGCs. Also, managerial insights for health organization authorities extracted from the final results and sensitivity analyses are presented for adequately handling the IMW network.
436862f3b5c487a2531672f3129afd0aef0e84c1	In this review, I use the term "perpetuation" for persistence of a virus in a population, since this is a different phenomenon from persistence of a virus in an infected host. Important variables that influence perpetuation differ in small (<1,000 individuals) and large (>10,000) populations: in small populations, two important variables are persistence in individuals, and turnover of the population, while in large populations important variables are transmissibility, generation time, and seasonality. In small populations, viruses such as poliovirus that cause acute infections cannot readily be perpetuated, in contrast to viruses such as hepatitis B virus, that cause persistent infections. However, small animal populations can turnover significantly each year, permitting the perpetuation of some viruses that cause acute infections. Large populations of humans are necessary for the perpetuation of acute viruses; for instance, measles required a population of 500,000 for perpetuation in the pre-measles vaccine era. Furthermore, if an acute virus, such as poliovirus, exhibits marked seasonality in large populations, then it may disappear during the seasonal trough, even in the presence of a large number of susceptible persons. Eradication is the converse of perpetuation and can be used as a definitive approach to the control of a viral disease, as in the instance of smallpox. Therefore, the requirements for perpetuation have significant implications for practical public health goals.

Post-partum bladder rupture might be associated with fetal pressure on the not emptied bladder wall during labor.

56a9bd299b9219f098f7b1f2cf1d95f7b65aa743	Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of viral gene delivery vectors, and recent clinical trials have shown promising results. However, the tight control of transgene expression is likely to be required for therapeutic applications and in some instances, for safety reasons. For this purpose, several ligand-dependent transcription regulatory systems have been developed. Among these, the tetracyclineregulatable system is by far the most frequently used and the most advanced towards gene therapy trials. This review will focus on this system and will describe the most recent progress in the regulation of transgene expression in various organs, including the muscle, the retina and the brain. Since the development of an immune response to the transactivator was observed following gene transfer in the muscle of nonhuman primate, focus will be therefore, given on the immune response to transgene products of the tetracycline inducible promoter.
a2a873c09a0bc1b59d326245310e25a83031cd62	The diagnosis of respiratory virus infections has evolved substantially in recent years, with the emergence of new pathogens and the development of novel detection methods. While recent advances have improved the sensitivity and turn-around time of diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses, they have also raised important issues such as cost, and the clinical significance of detecting multiple viruses in a single specimen by molecular methods. This article reviews recent advances in specimen collection and detection methods for diagnosis of respiratory virus infections, and discusses the performance characteristics and limitations of these methods.
945c07fab35dd9e7ca3462d92ea84977f4f3add5	Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, the public has been eager for news about promising treatments, and social media has played a large role in information dissemination. In this paper, our objectives are to characterize the public discussion of treatments on Twitter, and demonstrate the utility of these discussions for public health surveillance. We pulled tweets related to three promising COVID-19 treatments (hydroxychloroquine, remdevisir and convalescent plasma), between the dates of February 28th and May 22nd using the Twitter public API. We characterize treatment tweet trends over this time period. Most major tweet/retweet/sentiment trends correlated to public announcement made by the white house and/or to new clinical trial evidence about treatments. Most of the websites people shared in treatment-related tweets were nonscientific media sources that leaned conservative. Hydroxychloroquine was the most discussed treatment on Twitter, and over 10% of hydroxychloroquine tweets mentioned an adverse drug reaction. There is a gap between the public attention/discussion around COVID-19 treatments and their evidence. Twitter data can and should be used public health surveillance during this pandemic, as it is informative for monitoring adverse drug reactions, especially as many people avoid going to hospitals/doctors.
01e639ffca96085b7e416ca2a01e99e234643e93	Current study aims at prediction of the onset of malignant cardiac arrhythmia in patients with Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICDs) using Machine Learning algorithms. The input data consisted of 184 signals of RR-intervals from 29 patients with ICD, recorded both during normal heartbeat and arrhythmia. For every signal we generated 47 descriptors with different signal analysis methods. Then, we performed feature selection using several methods and used selected feature for building predictive models with the help of Random Forest algorithm. Entire modelling procedure was performed within 5-fold cross-validation procedure that was repeated 10 times. Results were stable and repeatable. The results obtained (AUC = 0.82, MCC = 0.45) are statistically significant and show that RR intervals carry information about arrhythmia onset. The sample size used in this study was too small to build useful medical predictive models, hence large data sets should be explored to construct models of sufficient quality to be of direct utility in medical practice.
6f95f2945a8f2fe23068d89e87b343da22e3e234	We present a massively parallel solver using the direction splitting technique and stabilized time-integration schemes for the solution of the three-dimensional non-stationary Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations. The model can be used for modeling atmospheric phenomena. The time integration scheme utilized enables for efficient direction splitting algorithm with finite difference solver. We show how to incorporate the terrain geometry into the simulation and how to perform the domain decomposition. The computational cost is linear O(N ) over each sub-domain, and near to O(N/c) in parallel over 1024 processors, where N is the number of unknowns and c is the number of cores. This is even if we run the parallel simulator over complex terrain geometry. We analyze the parallel scalability experimentally up to 1024 processors over a PROMETHEUS Linux cluster with multi-core processors. The weak scalability of the code shows that increasing the number of subdomains and processors from 4 to 1024, where each processor processes the subdomain of 49 × 49 × 99 internal points (50 × 50 × 100 box), results in the increase of the total computational time from 120 s to 178 s for a single time step. Thus, we can perform a single time step with over 1,128,000,000 unknowns within 3 min. The number of unknowns results from the fact that we have three components of the velocity vector field, one component of the pressure, and one component of the temperature scalar field over 256,000,000 mesh points. The computation of the one time step takes 3 min on a Linux cluster. The direction splitting solver is not an iterative solver; it solves the system accurately since it is equivalent to Gaussian elimination. Our code is interfaced with the mesh generator reading the NASA database and providing the Earth terrain map. The goal of the project is to provide a reliable tool for parallel, fully three-dimensional computations of the atmospheric phenomena.
b063814dfc5747f4e133d167fb638f9c6797525a	The COVID-19 pandemic has put those who oversee medical education in a challenging position. Medical school administrators, students, and national governing bodies have been forced to make difficult decision as a result of public health concerns and governmentenforced restrictions. We, as rising fourth-year medical students, would like to shed light upon the hard work that many of those in leadership positions have done as well as lay out some concerns that medical students who are preparing to apply to residency have. Additionally, we would like to suggest several potential approaches that attempt to address some of the problems arising from the pandemic. Continuing to balance education with the hurdles presented by COVID-19 will require a multi-faceted and coordinated approach. We believe that implementing virtual rotations, delaying the opening of the application, decentralizing clinical skills evaluations, and modifying graduation requirements are possible options among many that could aid in addressing some of the current challenges presented by COVID-19.
355dd77a2f3dd77605afc33a05b756d0b57a1ee4	a b s t r a c t 2-Aminopyrimidine based 4-aminoquinolines were synthesized using an efficacious protocol. Some of the compounds showed in vitro anti-plasmodial activity against drug-sensitive CQ S (3D7) and drugresistant CQ R (K1) strains of Plasmodium falciparum in the nM range. In particular, 5isopropyloxycarbonyl-6-methyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-2-[(7-chloroquinolin-4-ylamino)butylamino] pyrimidine depicted the lowest IC 50 (3.6 nM) value (56-fold less than CQ) against CQ R strain. Structureeactivity profile and binding with heme, m-oxo-heme have been studied. Binding assays with DNA revealed better binding with target parasite type AT rich pUC18 DNA. Most compounds were somewhat cytotoxic, but especially cytostatic. Molecular docking analysis with Pf DHFR allowed identification of stabilizing interactions.
f74923b3ce82c984a7ae3e0c2754c9e33c60554f	An enhanced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was developed in which a target gene pre-amplification step preceded TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR. Clinical samples were collected from 120 patients diagnosed as suspected or probable SARS cases and analyzed by conventional PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, conventional TaqMan real-time PCR, and our enhanced TaqMan real-time PCR assays. An amplicon of the size expected from SARS-CoV was obtained from 28/120 samples using the enhanced real-time PCR method. Conventional PCR and real-time PCR alone identified fewer SARS-CoV positive cases. Results were confirmed by viral culture in 3/28 cases. The limit of detection of the enhanced real-time PCR method was 10 2 -fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 10 7 -fold higher than conventional PCR methods. The increased sensitivity of the assay may help control the spread of the disease during future SARS outbreaks.
aa2b9f38a2b7a8bd6e35051f959931f8fde5e1a9	Proponents of the use of gain-of-function (GOF) experiments with pathogens with pandemic potential (PPP) have argued that such experiments are necessary because they reveal important facets of pathogenesis and can be performed safely. Opponents of GOF experiments with PPP have argued that the risks outweigh the knowledge gained. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the vulnerability of human societies to a new PPP, while also validating some arguments of both camps, questioning others, and suggesting the need to rethink how we approach this class of experiments.
80d5f3d9570784069b1a8b6994889272289ec2cc	SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) has been declared by WHO (World Health Organisation) as a global health threat. Within a period of four to five months in 2003, the disease infected some 8,000 people in more than 25 countries and left 774 dead. The many studies that have been done on the spread of SARS in Asia as well as countries as far flung as Germany and Canada have focused on the global dimension of the infectious disease as well as the speed of its spread upon emergence in southern China and then Hong Kong. Less attention has been paid to its spatial distribution at the national and local scales. This discussion focuses on the spread of SARS at the national and local spatial scales. In the process, the study presents the management of a hazard, in this case, an emerging infectious disease by national health care institutions such as the hospitals that ultimately proved to have been wholly unprepared for coping with at least the health aspects of the outcome of a globalised national agenda for growth and economic progress.
7115c4bf2dfc029be764f0cd2e13de0bf8ec1312	The study analyses the role of long-distance travel behaviours on the large-scale spatial spreading of directly transmitted infectious diseases, focusing on two different travel types in terms of the travellers travelling to a specific group or not. For this purpose, we have formulated and analysed a metapopulation model in which the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scalefree contact network. The long-distance travellers between the subpopulations will temporarily change the network structure of the destination subpopulation through the "merging effects (MEs), " which indicates that the travellers will be regarded as either connected components or isolated nodes in the contact network. The results show that the presence of the MEs has constantly accelerated the transmission of the diseases and aggravated the outbreaks compared to the scenario in which the diversity of the long-distance travel types is arbitrarily discarded. Sensitivity analyses show that these results are relatively constant regarding a wide range variation of several model parameters. Our study has highlighted several important causes which could significantly affect the spatiotemporal disease dynamics neglected by the present studies.
3c7c4968b4363f74cb32153a14d09e7d2a06e4b0	The analytical and clinical performance of a new rapid immunochromatography test, the SD Bioline Norovirus test, was evaluated for the detection of human norovirus in fecal specimens. The analytical performance studies were performed for detection limit, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and interference. For comparison, 92 norovirus-positive stool samples and 126 norovirus-negative samples for which the results were confirmed by 2 different real-time PCR kits were used. The rapid immunochromatography test detected the equivalent of 4.48 × 10 6 copies/mL of the norovirus genome in stool samples. On performing the repeatability/reproducibility test, samples above this concentration all provided positive results (100%) and 97.8% of the samples slightly below this concentration (2.45 × 10 6 copies/mL) provided negative results. No cross-reactivity or interference was detected. Positive percent agreement (sensitivity), negative percent agreement (specificity), and overall percent agreement of the rapid immunochromatography test compared with testing by real-time PCR were 90.2%, 100%, and 95.9%, respectively. In addition, the rapid immunochromatography test was completed within 20 min. The SD Bioline Norovirus test was, therefore, easier and more rapid to perform and showed excellent reproducibility, no cross-reactivity, no interference, and high agreement compared with real-time PCR. Thus, this test is useful for rapid screening to identity norovirus infection.
aecb440fc8c84846d96359ffd450f3e24a00cdca	YopH is a bacterial protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is essential for the viability and pathogenic virulence of the plague-causing Yersinia sp. bacteria. Inactivation of YopH activity would lead to the loss of bacterial pathogenicity. We have studied the inhibitory properties of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) against YopH phosphatase and found that at nanomolar concentrations ATA reversibly decreases the activity of YopH. Computational docking studies indicated that in all binding poses ATA binds in the YopH active site. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that in the predicted binding pose, ATA binds to the essential Cys403 and Arg409 residues in the active site and has a stronger binding affinity than the natural substrate (pTyr). The cyclic voltammetry experiments suggest that ATA reacts remarkably strongly with molecular oxygen. Additionally, the electrochemical reduction of ATA in the presence of a negative potential from -2.0 to 2.5 V generates a current signal, which is observed for hydrogen peroxide. Here we showed that ATA indicates a unique mechanism of YopH inactivation due to a redox process. We proposed that the potent inhibitory properties of ATA are a result of its strong binding in the YopH active site and in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide near catalytic cysteine residue.

e9e2c0d019c671da7c6a22bc969844362433d4b5	Objective The objectives of the study were to optimize three cartilage-dedicated sequences for in vivo knee imaging at 7.0 T ultra-high-field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to compare imaging performance and diagnostic confidence concerning osteoarthritis (OA)-induced changes at 7.0 and 3.0 T MRI. Materials and methods Optimized MRI sequences for cartilage imaging at 3.0 T were tailored for 7.0 T: an intermediate-weighted fast spin-echo (IM-w FSE), a fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) and a T1-weighted 3D high-spatial-resolution volumetric fatsuppressed spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) sequence. Three healthy subjects and seven patients with mild OA were examined. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), diagnostic confidence in assessing cartilage abnormalities, and image quality were determined. Abnormalities were assessed with the whole organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS). Focal cartilage lesions and bone marrow edema pattern (BMEP) were also quantified. Results At 7.0 T, SNR was increased (p<0.05) for all sequences. For the IM-w FSE sequence, limitations with the specific absorption rate (SAR) required modifications of the scan parameters yielding an incomplete coverage of the knee joint, extensive artifacts, and a less effective fat saturation. CNR and image quality were increased (p<0.05) for SPGR and FIESTA and decreased for IM-w FSE. Diagnostic confidence for cartilage lesions was highest (p<0.05) for FIESTA at 7.0 T. Evaluation of BMEP was decreased (p< 0.05) at 7.0 T due to limited performance of IM-w FSE. Conclusion Gradient echo-based pulse sequences like SPGR and FIESTA are well suited for imaging at UHF which may improve early detection of cartilage lesions. However, UHF IM-w FSE sequences are less feasible for clinical use. High-field (HF) magnetic resonance (MR) systems operating at a field strength (B 0 ) of 3.0 T have shown promise for musculoskeletal imaging [1-9] and are increasingly utilized in clinical practice [6] .

de30a8f78a08b082cbcb44310f464e061b32acfb	The Lansing strain of poliovirus type 2 is a mouse-adapted virus that induces a fatal paralytic disease in mice after intracerebral inoculation. Our previous results indicated that the mouse-adapted phenotype maps to the Lansing viral capsid. To further define regions of the capsid that are specifically involved in the infection of mice, antigenic variants resistant to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies were selected, and their mouse neurovirulence was studied. The monoclonal antibodies used were directed against antigenic site 1, an immunodominant loop of capsid polypeptide VP1 located on the virion surface. Ten of twenty-two variants selected had lower intracerebral neurovirulence in mice when compared to the parental virus. Four of the ten antigenic variants with reduced neurovirulence were temperature sensitive (ts) for replication in HeLa cells, while the remaining six variants replicated in HeLa cells as well as the parent virus. Two ts+ variants that were studied had a reduced ability to replicate in the mouse brain. There was no difference in the histopathology and pattern of involvement in the central nervous system of one variant compared to the parent virus. In three variants, reduction of neurovirulence correlated with specific amino acid substitutions at positions 100 and 101 of VP1 , located within antigenic site 1. The ts phenotype in three variants was associated with a single amino acid deletion at position 105. Virus recovered from the brain of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the antigenic variants was characterized to identify the virus causing disease. In most cases, brain isolates resembled the inoculated virus in neurovirulence and amino acid sequence at the antigenic site. Virus recovered from brains of paralyzed mice that had been inoculated with the ts variants was either ts+ or cold sensitive, and had become more neurovirulent. These results suggest that specific amino acid changes within an antigenic site on the virion surface may result in reduction of mouse neurovirulence without affecting viral replication in cultured cells. o 1987 Academic Press, Inc. 429
e302d6ddada9c67824ca50c015bcee69891d29e5	To reduce morbidity and mortality through integrated case management, a pilot study to detect respiratory viruses in patients with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) was designed as part of a nationwide surveillance for this disease in Korea. The study population consisted of hospitalized patients under the age of 5 years with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. A prospective 6-month study was performed. Two hundred and ninety-seven nasopharyngeal secretions were collected and multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR)/polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed to detect respiratory viruses. If there were any positive RT-PCR/PCR results, viral cultures were proceeded for confirmation. Respiratory viruses were identified in 49.6% of 296 patients. The detection rates were as follows: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected in 52.7% (87/165), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 15.8%, human corona virus (hCoV) in 5.5%, adenovirus in 9.7%, human bocavirus (hBoV) in 5.5%, parainfluenza virus (PIV) in movirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human corona viruses (hCoV)-OC 43, 229E were scanned by the multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR)/polymerase chain reactions (PCR) Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (
35b2800087710c132b014aa7595a7968bc177cc5	The host antiviral programs that are initiated following viral infection form a dynamic and complex web of responses that we have collectively termed as "the antiviral landscape". Conventional approaches to studying antiviral responses have primarily used reductionist systems to assess the function of a single or a limited subset of molecules. Systems biology is a holistic approach that considers the entire system as a whole, rather than individual components or molecules. Systems biology based approaches facilitate an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of the antiviral landscape, while allowing for the discovery of emergent properties that are missed by conventional approaches. The antiviral landscape can be viewed as a hierarchy of complexity, beginning at the whole organism level and progressing downward to isolated tissues, populations of cells, and single cells. In this review, we will discuss how systems biology has been applied to better understand the antiviral landscape at each of these layers. At the organismal level, the Collaborative Cross is an invaluable genetic resource for assessing how genetic diversity influences the antiviral responses. Whole tissue and isolated bulk cell transcriptomics serves as a critical tool for the comprehensive analysis of antiviral responses at both the tissue and cellular levels of complexity. Finally, new techniques in single cell analysis are emerging tools that will revolutionize our understanding of how individual cells within a bulk infected cell population contribute to the overall antiviral landscape.
c2bcf7dae95b8f134bdbaeb8ff778816e932e6c1	Background: This unblinded randomised crossover study compares two endotracheal tube introducers (ETIs): the FROVA and the "Flexible Tip Bougie" (FTB), in an airway manikin mimicking difficult intubation with a percentage of glottic opening view of 30%. Participants were Emergency Medicine and Anaesthesia trainees with recent experience of less than twenty patient intubations. The primary outcome was time to intubation, further divided into time taken to pass the ETI and time to railroad the endotracheal tube (ETT) over the ETI. The secondary outcome was the difficulty of intubation. Results: The median total time to ETT placement was significantly shorter with the FTB (37.5 s) compared with the FROVA ETI (63.0 s), P = 0.0006. The median difficulty reported (scores 0-10 with 0 being no difficulty) with the FTB was 2 compared with 5 for the FROVA, P < 0.0001. Conclusions: The FTB enabled significantly faster and easier placement of the endotracheal tube compared with the FROVA in inexperienced hands intubating a difficult intubation manikin.

d843bc13306cd816f4628c0bb385230a2265a469	Recent studies have shown promising results of using BERT for Information Retrieval with its advantages in understanding the text content of documents and queries. Compared to short, keywords queries, higher accuracy of BERT were observed on long, natural language queries, demonstrating BERT's ability in extracting rich information from complex queries. These results show the potential of using query expansion to generate better queries for BERT-based rankers. In this work, we explore BERT's sensitivity to the addition of structure and concepts. We find that traditional word-based query expansion is not entirely applicable, and provide insight into methods that produce better experimental results.
c3665d70b93633c110e9b91c1d359d89a10955a4	Objective To determine the frequency and effects of nosocomial respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in premature neonates, including those who may be asymptomatic. We performed a year-long surveillance for RVIs in infants <33 weeks gestational age admitted to 2 Syracuse neonatal intensive care units. Infants were enrolled within 3 days of neonatal intensive care unit admission and were sampled for RVIs until discharge using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay capable of detecting 17 different respiratory viruses or subtypes. Results Twenty-six of 50 prematurely born infants (52%) tested positive for a respiratory virus at least once during their birth hospitalization. Testing positive for a respiratory virus was significantly associated with longer length of stay (70 days vs 35 days, P = .002) and prolonged ventilatory support (51 vs 13 days, P = .002). Infants who tested positive for a respiratory virus during their birth hospitalization had more than twice the rate of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P < .05). Conclusion Nosocomial RVIs were frequent in our study population, despite the absence of clinical indicators of illness. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer and a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was more common in infants who had respiratory viruses detected. (J Pediatr 2012;161:814-8).
c7dd9e6d51e8158eb70c533bea799406c966c95a	Background: This study was performed to compare the viral load and kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in saliva with those in standard nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs. Methods: Fifteen patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from four hospitals were prospectively enrolled and matched samples of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva were collected at Day 1 of admission and every other day till consequently negative for two times. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed to detect the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes. Results: The cycle threshold values of saliva were comparable to those of NP/OP swabs overall (P = 0.720, Mann-Whitney U test). However, the overall sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was 64% (34/53), which is lower than the 77% (41/53) using NP/OP swabs. The sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was especially lower in early stage of symptom onset (1-5 days; 8/15; 53%) and in patients who did not have sputum (12/22; 55%).
f021d8bdb3482a6965a104dddb2516d179bd9c34	Background -: Genetic testing for hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC) had significant psychological consequences for test recipients. This prospective longitudinal study investigated the factors that predict psychological resilience in adults undergoing genetic testing for HCRC. on Hong Kong Chinese HCRC family members who were recruited and offered genetic testing by the Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry to determine psychological outcomes after genetic testing. Self-completed questionnaires were administered immediately before (pre-disclosure baseline) and 2 weeks, 4 months and 1 year after result disclosure. Using validated psychological inventories, the cognitive style of hope was measured at baseline, and the psychological distress of depression and anxiety was measured at all time points. Of the 76 participating subjects, 71 individuals (43 men and 28 women; mean age 38.9 ± 9.2 years) from nine FAP and 24 HNPCC families completed the study, including 39 mutated gene carriers. Four patterns of outcome trajectories were created using established norms for the specified outcome measures of depression and anxiety. These included chronic dysfunction (13% and 8.7%), recovery (0% and 4.3%), delayed dysfunction (13% and 15.9%) and resilience (76.8% and 66.7%). Two logistic regression analyses were conducted using hope at baseline to predict resilience, with depression and anxiety employed as outcome indicators. Because of the small number of participants, the chronic dysfunction and delayed dysfunction groups were combined into a non-resilient group for comparison with the resilient group in all subsequent analysis. Because of low frequencies, participants exhibiting a recovery trajectory (n = 3 for anxiety and n = 0 for depression) were excluded from further analysis. Both regression equations were significant. Baseline hope was a significant predictor of a resilience outcome trajectory for depression (B = -0.24, p < 0.01 for depression); and anxiety (B = -0.11, p = 0.05 for anxiety). The current findings suggest that hopefulness may predict resilience after HCRC genetic testing in Hong Kong Chinese. Interventions to increase the level of hope may be beneficial to the psychological adjustment of CRC genetic testing recipients.
9f667607bb77a0ba7d193d2426e96aa34d449a70	A fast Endospore Germinability Assay (EGA) was validated with traditional plate counts to enumerate single endospore germination events for monitoring surface sterilization. The assay is based on a time-gated luminescence microscopy technique enabling visualization and enumeration of individual germinating endospores. Germinating endospores release calcium dipicolinate to form highly luminescent terbium dipicolinate complexes surrounding each germinating endospore. EGA and heterotrophic plate counting (HPC) were used to evaluate the swab/rinse recovery efficiency of endospores from stainless steel surfaces. EGA and HPC results were highly correlated for endospore recovery from stainless steel coupons inoculated with range of 1,000 endospores per coupon down to sterility. Dosage-dependent decrease of surface endospore germinability were observed in dry heat, UV irradiation, oxygen plasma and vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatments, measured with EGA and HPC. EGA is a fast and complementary method to traditional HPC for quantitative sterility assurance testing of surfaces. This work introduces and validates a 15-minute or faster assay for germinable endospores to complement the conventional lengthy, culture-based surface sterility validation, which is critical in hospitals, food and pharmaceutical industries to help minimize nosocomial infection, food spoilage, and pharmaceutical contamination. Even before the era of microbiology, people adopted cooking, bathing and washing garments to reduce the devastating effects of disease caused by infectious pathogens 1,2 . Cleansing and purification of materials have been employed to improve human health since Roman times, but it was not until the 1800s when Louis Pasteur and William Henry explored pressurized steam for sterilization of contaminated clothing and materials that have been in contact with contagions 3 . The ongoing co-evolution of pathogen and human has been described as an arms race, where new developments of antimicrobial medicines are overcome by microbes with newly evolved resistance to those drugs 4-7 . Indeed, as drug development fails to keep pace with increased microbial resistance, hygiene and monitoring of sterility assurance are becoming increasingly important. Because of the persistence of nosocomial infections and foodborne diseases, much attention in health care, food and pharmaceutical industries has focused on the need for appropriate surface cleaning, disinfection, and sterility assurance. The cleanliness of surfaces, such as walls, countertops, and floors, in hospitals have been shown to correlate with the occurrence of cross-contamination 8-11 . In the food industry, surfaces in contact with food are critical, because food provides nutrients and substrate for microbes to proliferate. Inadequate cleaning and disinfection of these surfaces put consumers at risk, and leads to food spoilage or shortened shelf lives 12,13 . Quality assurance methods in the pharmaceutical industry to prevent microbial contamination are also strictly regulated to ensure aseptic processing of products 14, 15 . Sterility assurance is also important in space exploration, where nations are required by international law to ensure that interplanetary spacecraft destined to potentially habitable worlds in our solar system contain less than a specified bioburden 16, 17 . For example, Mars lander missions without life-detection experiments must meet a bioburden limit of 3 × 10 5 endospores/vehicle, and less than 300 endospores/m 2 . Missions with life-detection experiments must undergo additional procedures to ensure that the total bioburden is even lower 18 . The standards www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ pertaining to bioburden use endospores (i.e., bacterial spores) as the indicator organisms to verify that bioburden thresholds are not exceeded. Endospores are ideal bioindicator organisms because they are the most resistant form of life towards various sterilization regimens, such as dry heat, steam, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, ethylene oxide, oxygen plasma and ultraviolet radiation [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Evaluation of microbial contamination on work surfaces has relied on the swab and rinse sampling techniques and standard heterotrophic plate count (HPC), which have been widely practiced in hospitals, food processing plants, and by NASA for evaluating the bioburden level of flight hardware for planetary protection in robotic extraterrestrial missions 24,25 . The major drawback is that HPC usually requires several days for results. Faster and more efficient methods have been proposed in recent years to measure microbial contamination of surfaces, such as ATP bioluminescence, enzyme, and nucleic acid-based techniques 26-30 . Yet, conventional cleaning practices of surfaces still largely do not include quantitative approaches for assessing the effectiveness of the cleaning regimen, because of cost, ease-of-use, or time-to-results. There is a need for fast, quantitative, cost effective and convenient methods to assess the level of contamination on surfaces in tracking routes of infection, surveillance of the environment and evaluation of decontamination protocols. The endospore germinability assay (EGA) addresses this need by enabling the fast measurement of germinable endospore populations, which serve as excellent indicators for measuring surface bioburden reduction, owing to their omnipresence in the environment, and because they are the hardiest microbial organisms. Consequently, a reduction of viable endospores necessarily indicates an even greater reduction in non-spore forming microorganisms. The concept of endospores as bioindicators for monitoring sterilization effectiveness is extensively used in hospitals, where sterilization processes are monitored by using endospores as dosimeters (e.g., endospore test strips to verify autoclave compliance with regulatory requirements 31 ). Endospore producing genera include Geobacillus, Bacillus and Clostridium, which produce this dormant and resilient form during times of environmental stress. They are protected from environmental extremes and sterilants by a series of protective layers, including spore coat, peptidoglycan cortex, and a core that includes high concentrations of calcium dipicolinate stores 32-34 . Endospores can remain dormant for many years 35,36 , and when more favorable conditions are signaled by the presence of water, nutrients, and germinants, endospores may germinate and become metabolically active 22, 37, 38 . In the context of human health, this enables endospore-forming pathogens (e.g., B. anthracis, C. botulinum, and C. difficile) to persist after cleaning regimens are applied, causing contamination, food spoilage, and disease. The remarkable resistance of endospores makes them ideal bioindicators for both sterility assurance of sterilizers and of surfaces in work environments of health care, food and pharmaceutical industries, and for planetary protection as humans continue to explore potentially habitable worlds in the solar systems. We have previously reported on germinable-endospore biodosimetry using EGA to achieve rapid validation of sterilization in aqueous suspensions 39 . DPA (dipicolinic acid, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) naturally present in endospores can be released from the core by inducing germination (e.g., with L-alanine 40,41 ) or physical lysis (e.g., autoclaving, microwaving 42 ). L-alanine is a general germinant for endospores, and the addition induces endospores to germinate and release approximately 10 8 DPA molecules per endospore. When endospores germinate and release their Ca-DPA stores into the immediate surrounding volume, the resultant Tb-DPA luminescent complex surrounding the germinated endospore bodies, are imaged with a time-gated microscope. DPA acts as a light-harvesting antenna with a large extinction coefficient in the UV to transfer the energy to Tb 3+ upon UV excitation [43] [44] [45] [46] . An intensity profile can be recorded in accordance with the lag time and germination dynamics on a time scale of 15 minutes for most germinable spores in a population. Only a small subset of the germinable population germinates > 15 minutes, even for populations that have been exposed to inactivation regimens. Each Tb-DPA luminescent spot in the time-gated microscope field of view is assigned and enumerated as one germinable endospore. In this paper, we focus on the application of EGA for detecting germinable endospores on test surfaces, which involves a 4-step procedure consisting of (i) swab-rinse sampling, (ii) sample preparation, (iii) time-gated imaging with EGA, and (iv) enumeration of germinable endospores 39,47 . EGA has also been used to investigate germinable endospore populations within environmental samples, including ice cores 39,48 , desert soils 39,48 , and an Antarctic lake 49 , and has been adapted for Clostridium endospores 48,50 . The objectives of this investigation are to (1) validate the EGA methodology in comparison to standard HPC to assess the number of endospores sampled from nonporous stainless steel coupon surfaces, and (2) employ EGA in comparison to HPC for determination of the decimal reduction values of surface endospore populations inactivated by dry heat, ultraviolet radiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and atmospheric pressure air plasma.

1c6f1888177420011ff0c6e714490bb9216898d9	Purpose. The purpose of this study was to find out risk factors associated with pneumonia, 35 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and clinical outcome among patients with 2019 36 novel coronavirus disease . Methods. This was a cross-sectional multicenter clinical study. A total of 95 patients infected 38 with COVID-19 were enrolled. The COVID-19 diagnostic standard was PCR detection of 39 target genes of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV). Clinical, laboratory, and radiological 40 results as well as treatment outcome data were obtained. ARDS was defined as oxygenation Findings. Multivariate analysis showed that older age (OR=1.078, P=0.008) and high BMI 43 (OR=1.327, P=0.024) were independent risk factor associated with patients with pneumonia. For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure 45 (SBP) level (OR=1.046, P=0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (OR=1.010, 46 P=0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS. A total of 70 patients were 47 conducted CT scan repeatedly after treatment. Patients were divided in disease exacerbation 48 group (n=19) and disease relieve group (n=51). High BMI (OR=1.285, P=0.017) and tobacco 49 smoking (OR=16.13, P=0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease 50 exacerbation after treatment. 51 Implications. Our results help to risk stratification in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. 52 Patients with risk factors should be given timely intervention to avoid disease progression. 53 , several cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology have been 65 found in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China 1 . Those cases have been confirmed as acute 66 respiratory infections caused by a novel coronavirus infection. To date, confirmed cases have 93 Dongguan People's Hospital and Nanfang hospital, Southern Medical University from 94 January 2020 to February 2020 were enrolled. Our study population is hospitalized patients. 95 Because COVID-19 is an infectious disease, all outpatients are forced to be quarantined in 96 the hospital if they were confirmed infected with 2019-nCoV. Oral consent was obtained 97 from patients. The 2019-nCoV infection diagnostic standard was polymerase chain reaction 98 detection of two target genes of 2019-nCoV, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and 99 nucleocapsid protein (N). A positive result was determined to be 209-nCoV infection. 100 101 129 Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed using logistic regression 130 analysis and the results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 13.0) with an alpha level of 0.05. 132 133 3 Results 134 1.1 Characteristics of patients with COVID-19 157 (P=0.046). 158 159 3.4 Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors associated with ARDS 160 Logistic regression was utilized to identify factors that were significantly associated with 161 ARDS in patients with COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, high SBP level (OR=1.046, 162 P=0.025) and high LDH level (OR=1.010, P=0.021) were found to be independent risk 163 factors associated with ARDS among patients with COVID-19 (Table 4) . 164 165 3.5 Differences in characteristics between patients with pneumonia exacerbation and relieve 166 A total of 70 patients underwent CT scanning repeatedly after 1-week treatment. Based on 167 the findings obtained after comparing with the first CT scan, patients were divided into the 168 pneumonia exacerbation group (n=19) and pneumonia relieve group (n=51). The 169 characteristics were compared, and the results showed that patients with pneumonia 263
a61decd8206be7cf958c95121bb6f039f306b621	The severity of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) correlates correlates poorly with lung weight and lung mechanics, leading to the proposal of phenotypes that may be associated with similar degree of hypoxaemia but different lung volume, weight, and compliance [1] . The alteration of the pulmonary vascular tone and immune thrombosis of the alveolar capillaries [2] may account for these pathophysiological characteristics and for the high physiological dead space observed in these patients. To describe estimated indices of physiological dead space-and their association with respiratory mechanics, severity of hypoxaemia, biomarkers, and outcomes-we performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in four medical Intensive Care Units (ICU) within Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust-London, UK (Ethics reference: 10,796). We used the recorded values at the time of worst PaO 2 / FiO 2 observed on the day of critical care admission. Continuous variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. This cohort included 213 patients (73% males), mean (95%CI) age 56 (54-57) years, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 128 (121-135) mmHg. When subdivided in four groups based on cut-off PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 150 mmHg and compliance of 40 mL/cmH 2 O; 72% (n = 154) had PaO 2 / FiO 2 < 150 mmHg, of these, 112 (73%, or 53% of the overall cohort) had compliance < 40 mL/cmH 2 O (eTable 1). The mean (95%CI) estimated physiological dead space fraction [3] was high in the entire cohort at 0.53 (0.51-0.56). ICU outcome was available for 193 patients, where estimated physiological dead space fraction was higher in non-survivors [median (IQR), 0.57 (0.46-0.65) vs. 0.5 (0.4-0.64); p = 0.03]. All estimates of physiological dead space increased with the degree of hypoxaemia, but not with the reduction in lung compliance (Fig. 1) . Compared with patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 > 150 mmHg, patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg had higher estimated physiological dead space fraction [0.55 (0.52-0.57) vs. 0.5 (0.47-0.53); p = 0.036) (Fig. 1A) , mean (95%CI) corrected minute volume [4] [9.3(8.8-9.7) vs. 8.2 (7.6-8.8) L/min; p = 0.004] (Fig. 1B) , and ventilatory ratio [5] [1.43 (1.37-1.5) vs. 1.29 (1.2-1.38); p = 0.001] (Fig. 1C ). Although patients with compliance < 40 mL/cmH 2 O had a higher corrected minute volume [4] [9.4 (8.8-10) vs. 8.8 (8.4-9.3) L/min; p = 0.023] (Fig. 1C) , there was no difference in the two compliance groups in estimated physiological dead space fraction [0.55 (0.48-0.56) vs. 0.54 (0.52-0.56); p = 0.72] (Fig. 1A ) and ventilatory ratio [5] 1.4 (1.3-1.5) vs. 1.4 (1.33-1.46); p = 0.76) (Fig. 1B) .
376004b900cd163891128558e6c275dab9ecf34d	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) belongs to the Hepacivirus genus and is genetically heterogeneous, with seven major genotypes further divided into several recognized subtypes. HCV origin was previously dated in a range between ∼200 and 1000 years ago. Hepaciviruses have been identified in several domestic and wild mammals, the largest viral diversity being observed in bats and rodents. The closest relatives of HCV were found in horses/donkeys (equine hepaciviruses, EHV). However, the origin of HCV as a human pathogen is still an unsolved puzzle. Using a selection-informed evolutionary model, we show that the common ancestor of extant HCV genotypes existed at least 3000 years ago (CI: 3192-5221 years ago), with the oldest genotypes being endemic to Asia. EHV originated around 1100 CE (CI: 291-1640 CE). These time estimates exclude that EHV transmission was mainly sustained by widespread veterinary practices and suggest that HCV originated from a single zoonotic event with subsequent diversification in human populations. We also describe a number of biologically important sites in the major HCV genotypes that have been positively selected and indicate that drug resistance-associated variants are significantly enriched at positively selected sites. HCV exploits several cell-surface molecules for cell entry, but only two of these (CD81 and OCLN) determine the species-specificity of infection. Herein evolutionary analyses do not support a long-standing association between primates and hepaciviruses, and signals of positive selection at CD81 were only observed in Chiroptera. No evidence of selection was detected for OCLN in any mammalian order. These results shed light on the origin of HCV and provide a catalog of candidate genetic modulators of HCV phenotypic diversity.
69261897aa16e93e2fb388aebe69ccd5e0f51a1b	Purpose Laboratory abnormalities, which characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified, nevertheless, data concerning laboratory characteristics of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 are limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate the laboratory characteristics of pregnant compared to non-pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods A retrospective cohort study of all pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 who were examined at the obstetric emergency room in a tertiary medical center between March and April 2020. Patients were compared with non-pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 matched by age, who were examined at the general emergency room during the study period. All patients were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Clinical characteristics and laboratory results were compared between the groups. Results Study group included 11 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2, who were compared to 25 non-pregnant controls. Respiratory complaints were the most frequent reason for emergency room visit, and were reported in 54.5% and 80.0% of the pregnant and control groups, respectively (p = 0.12). White blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, and liver enzymes counts were within the normal range in both groups. Lyphocytopenia was observed in 45.5% and 32% of the pregnant and control groups, respectively (p = 0.44). The relative lymphocyte count to WBC was significantly reduced in the pregnant group compared to the controls [13. 6% (4.5-19.3) vs. 26.5% (15.7-29.9); p = 0.003]. C-reactive protein [20(5-41) vs. 14 (2-52) mg/dL; p = 0.81] levels were elevated in both groups but without significant difference between them. Conclusion Laboratory characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women, although a trend of lower lymphocyte count was observed in the pregnant women group.

The algorithm of Needleman-Wunsch is well known for globally aligning two sequences. However, this algorithm is unsuitable for sequences of long length. Many heuristic algorithms are proposed, such as BLAST and FASTA. However, they are still unsuitable for long sequences. In this paper, we study the alignment problem on highly similar sequences. By taking SARS viruses as an example, our result shows that our algorithm runs faster than Clustalx for aligning two SARS viruses. It implies that our algorithm is suitable for viruses of high similarity.
90ba51f14fa67f67464a1ff3688f3ec3af4fcd78	medRxiv preprint 2 What is already known on this subject? 1 Emerging evidence suggests that the burden of COVID-19 infection is falling unequally across 2 England, with provisional data suggesting higher overall infection and mortality rates for Black, 3 Asian, and mixed race/ethnicity individuals. 4 What does this study add? 5 We found that regions with greater socioeconomic deprivation and poorer population health 6 measures showed a faster rise in COVID-19 cases, and reached higher peak case levels. Areas 7 with a higher proportion of Black residents were more likely to show this kind of time course, 8 even after adjusting for multiple co-occurring factors, including population density. This finding 9 merits further investigation in terms of the intersecting vulnerability factors Black and other 10 minority ethnic individuals face in England (e.g. proportion of people working in service and 11 caring roles, and the role of structural discrimination), and has implications for the ongoing 12 allocation of public health resources, in order to better mitigate such inequalities. Abstract 14 15 Objective: To identify factors associated with local variation in the time course of COVID-19 16 case burden in England. 17 18 Methods: We analyzed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case data for 150 upper tier local 19 authorities, from the period from January 30 to May 6, 2020, as reported by Public Health 20 England. Using methods suitable for time-series data, we identified clusters of local authorities 21 with distinct trajectories of daily cases, after adjusting for population size. We then tested for 22 differences in sociodemographic, economic, and health disparity factors between these clusters. 23 24 Results: Two clusters of local authorities were identified: a higher case trajectory that rose faster 25 over time to reach higher peak infection levels, and a lower case trajectory cluster that emerged 26 more slowly, and had a lower peak. The higher case trajectory cluster (79 local authorities) had 27 higher population density (p<0.001), higher proportion of Black and Asian residents (p=0.03; 28 p=0.02), higher multiple deprivation scores (p<0.001), a lower proportions of older adults 29 (p=0.005), and higher preventable mortality rates (p=0.03). Local authorities with higher 30 proportions of Black residents were more likely to belong to the high case trajectory cluster, even 31 after adjusting for population density, deprivation, proportion of older adults and preventable 32 mortality (p=0.04). 33 34 Conclusion: Areas belonging to the trajectory with significantly higher COVID-19 case burden 35 were more deprived, and had higher proportions of ethnic minority residents. A higher 36 proportion of Black residents in regions belonging to the high trajectory cluster was not fully 37 explained by differences in population density, deprivation, and other overall health disparities 38 between the clusters.
979e31f09977a01352c1b86ec2dcc4844d4893f3	Two-pore channels (TPCs) are cation-permeable channels located on endolysosomal membranes and important mediators of intracellular Ca 2+ signalling. TPCs are involved in various pathophysiological processes, including cell growth and development, metabolism, and cancer progression. Most studies of TPCs have used TPC -/cell or whole-animal models, or Ned-19, an indirect inhibitor. The TPC activation mechanism remains controversial, which has made it difficult to develop selective modulators. Recent studies of TPC structure and their interactomes are aiding the development of direct pharmacological modulators. This process is still in its infancy, but will facilitate future research and TPC targeting for therapeutical purposes. Here, we review the progress of current research into TPCs, including recent insights into their structures, functional roles, mechanisms of activation, and pharmacological modulators. Changes in intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) constitutes a key signalling mechanism that mediates diverse cellular functions [1]. One source of cytoplasmic Ca 2+ is extracellular Ca 2+ , the entry of which into the cell is regulated by voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs), receptoroperated calcium channels (ROCCs), and storage-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Figure 1) [2]. Another source is internal stores, which release Ca 2+ when their receptors are activated by Ca 2+ -mobilising messengers, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ), cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). IP 3 and cADPR activate IP 3 receptors (IP 3 Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), respectively, both of which regulate Ca 2+ release from the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR); NAADP targets TPCs to mediate Ca 2+ release from acidic endolysosomal organelles (Figure 1) [3, 4] . NAADP is the most potent Ca 2+ -mobilising messenger, exerting its action even at low nanomolar concentrations [5] . NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ signalling can further trigger Ca 2+ release from the ER/SR, via Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release (CICR) [6] . TPCs have gained increasing attention as integral components of the NAADP-regulated Ca 2+ channel system, although they can also act as sodium (Na + ) channels regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P 2 ] [7, 8] . The exact activation mechanisms mediated by NAADP and PI(3,5)P 2 remain controversial, adding further to the TPC enigma. Two-pore channel (TPC)-mediated endolysosomal Ca 2+ signalling regulates a variety of processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, viral infection, and cardiac function.
54b313c4df1677f9f07d9cbbcc85b62a68062f19	In late December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the Chinese city Wuhan among a cluster of pneumonia patients. While it is known that pregnant women have reduced immunity and they are at risk for COVID-19 infection during the current pandemic, it is not clear if the disease manifestation would be different in pregnant women from non-pregnant women. Objectives: To describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15 th 2020 and May 31 st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15 th 2020). Results: A total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). During the study period, 141 (76.2%) patients continued their pregnancy, 3 (1.6%) had a miscarriage, 1 (0.5%) had intrauterine fetal death and only 2 (1.1%) patients developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 (5%) of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing. Conclusion: Pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk to the COVID-19 than the general population. The clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of the general population having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the management of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6	Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are endemic in many countries, and re-emerging in the developed countries. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is important for early treatment for reducing the duration of infection as well as for preventing further potential health complications. In this work, we have developed a novel colorimetric molecular assay that integrates nucleic acid analysis by dynamic chemistry (ChemNAt) with reverse dot-blot hybridization in an array format for a rapid and easy discrimination of Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi. the assay consists of a singleplex pCR step that amplifies a highly homologous DNA sequence which encodes for the RNA component of the large ribosome subunit. The amplicons of the two different parasites differ between them by single nucleotide variations, known as "single Nucleotide Fingerprint" (sNF) markers. the sNF markers can be easily identified by naked eye using a novel micro Spin-Tube device "Spin-Tube", as each of them creates a specific spot pattern. Moreover, the direct use of ribosomal RNA without requiring the PCR pre-amplification step is also feasible, further increasing the simplicity of the assay. The molecular assay delivers sensitivity capable of identifying up to 8.7 copies per µL with single mismatch specificity. The Spin-Tube thus represents an innovative solution providing benefits in terms of time, cost, and simplicity, all of which are crucial for the diagnosis of infectious disease in developing countries. Parasitic diseases not only cause millions of deaths per year, but also have serious health and economic consequences 1 . Among all the parasitic diseases, protozoan parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae are responsible for devastating diseases in humans, dogs as well as livestock, resulting in severe illness or even death if left untreated 1,2 . The protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and Leishmania spp. are the causative agents of Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis respectively 3 . Even though these diseases are endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, in the last decades there has been a re-emergence also in developed countries, with international travel being responsible for increases in reported cases of Trypanosomatidae infections in non-endemic countries 1,4 . Consequently, these parasitic infections have become a more important public health issue of global relevance. Even though there are several methods available for the screening of parasitic infections, however, they have not yet changed dramatically the diagnosis in developing countries. Microscopic identification and parasite cultivation are still the primary diagnostic tools employed in many regions where Leishmaniasis is endemic 5 . These methods, unfortunately, require extended incubation times and are expensive, requiring specialized equipment and highly trained personnel 6 . On the other hand, standard serological approaches that could potentially prove to be timely and cost effective for diagnosing parasitic infections are of limited value, as most patients do not develop a significant antibody response 7 . In addition, and problematically for clinicians attempting to make an accurate diagnosis, T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. share various antigens that cause cross-reactivity in serological diagnosis when complex antigenic mixtures are used 8 . As a result, Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) methodologies have become valuable methods for the routine and accurate assessment of parasitic infectious diseases. NAT benefits from the presence of specific nucleic acid fragments for determining the presence/absence of pathogens 3,9-13 . There are different methods ranging from probe hybridization, amplification of genomic targets and sequencing of nucleic acid fragments. The use of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques (NAATs) such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), real-time PCR or Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) can be very useful in detecting infections and post-treatment monitoring 9,13,14 , including detection and distinguishing of parasites using single base resolution methods such as Single Base Extension (SBE). Primers are designed to hybridize to a complementary nucleic acid region such that the 3′ end of the primer finishes immediately before the nucleotide under interrogation 15 . However, while NAT has the advantage of being sensitive, there are some limitations, as the NAT methodologies have complex protocols, require technical expertise to run and interpret data (not cost-effective), and utilize equipment that is incompatible with use in remote and low-resource locations, such as developing countries where diagnostic laboratories are often poorly resourced and sparsely distributed 16 . Thus, there is an urgent need for early detection of infectious disease with improved, simple and low-cost alternative tests not requiring expensive laboratory equipment to be performed. To sum up, while laboratory-based models require benchtop laboratory facilities and complex procedures, Point-of-Care testing allows a more decentralized diagnostic analysis with additional advantages such as portability, automation, shorter time-to-results and lower cost [17] [18] [19] . The World Health Organization (WHO) is consistently encouraging developers to implement these new diagnostic technologies for improved effective clinical management and treatment of the major infections suitable in developing countries context 20,21 . These diagnostic devices should follow WHO criteria, the ASSURED acronym (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free and deliverable) 22,23 . Following this encouragement, Zhang et al. recently developed a low-cost CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx) for detecting DNA or RNA molecules of pathogenic species with single mismatch specificity 24,25 . Besides the tests available today 19,26 , our group has recently reported the successful detection and differentiation of three Trypanosomatids species, by detecting Single Nucleotide Fingerprint (SNF) markers using a dynamic chemical approach for nucleic acid reading (ChemNAT technology) 27,28 in combination with MALDI-ToF 29 . SNF markers are single nucleotide variations that occur at specific positions in conserved target nucleic acid sequences, allowing the differentiation of pathogenic species. As a result, these SNF represents the perfect target to be interrogated by the ChemNAT technology through the specific dynamic incorporation of aldehyde-modified SMART-Nucleobases into the abasic position of abasic PNA probes. Despite its high specificity, the use of this method has limitations, with higher cost and complex instrumentation (MALDI-ToF) required, making this approach unsuitable for diagnosis of parasitic infections in developing countries. Here, we report the adaptation of our previous method onto a colorimetric reverse dot-blot 30-35 assay that has the potential to fulfil the WHO ASSURED criteria, for the diagnosis of Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. This novel method combines ChemNAT technology with a simple colorimetric end-point assay on a porous nylon membrane contained within a micro Spin-Tube device (Spin-Tube). The assay uses a singleplex PCR to amplify a highly conserved sequence of DNA, which encodes the RNA component of the large ribosome subunit with SNF markers for the two different parasite species under interrogation. This amplicon is later interrogated by the ChemNAT technology that relies on a dynamic chemical approach for nucleic acid testing. As shown in Fig. 1 , the SNF sequence analysis is based on combining biotinylated aldehyde-modified cytosine (SMART-C-Biotin) with unique abasic PNA probes to target PCR amplicon strands, such that a nucleobase-free position on the PNA strand (known as 'abasic' position) lies opposite to two different nucleotides under interrogation on the DNA amplicons. A reversible reaction between the SMART-C-Biotin and a free secondary amine on the abasic PNA probes generates an iminium intermediate, which can be chemically reduced to a stable tertiary amine. Within the novel Spin-Tube, the dynamic chemistry reaction mixture is added to the nylon membranes on which the abasic PNA probes have been immobilized following a specific spot pattern (Fig. 1, Step 1) . The PCR amplicons act as template molecules and drive the specific incorporation of SMART-C-Biotin molecules into a specific abasic PNA according to Watson-Crick DNA base pairing model in which the SMART-Cytosine, in this case carrying a biotin tag, is ONLY recognized by a guanidine nucleotide (Fig. 1, Step 2). The labelling is then achieved by streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (Streptavidin-ALP) to produce colorimetric signal (blue precipitate) patterns when the chromogenic substrate (NBT/BCIP, nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) is added. Each parasite gives a unique colored spot pattern that can be read by naked-eye (Fig. 1, step 3) .
467240da5b8636371c3eef393595ca39194c9e7c	The lung epithelial surface is one of the vital barriers or sensors in the body responding to the external atmosphere and thereby always subjecting to direct toxicological exposure, stress, stimulus, or infection. Due to its relatively higher sensitivity in response to toxicants, the use of lung epithelial cell culture and lung tissue from animal models or patients has facilitated our learning to lung physiopathology and toxicopharmacology. The recent advancement of proteomics has made it possible to investigate the cellular response at a global level. In this review, the potential applications of proteomic approach in studying lung-related diseases and biomarker discovery will be discussed.
c55d4894eabfa8561f007f18929d5f7c360eb83b	Systemic infection triggers a spectrum of metabolic and behavioral changes, collectively termed sickness behavior, which while adaptive, can affect mood and cognition. In vulnerable individuals, acute illness can also produce profound, maladaptive, cognitive dysfunction including delirium, but our understanding of delirium pathophysiology remains limited. Here, we used bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in female C57BL/6J mice and acute hip fracture in humans to address whether disrupted energy metabolism contributes to inflammation-induced behavioral and cognitive changes. LPS (250 mg/kg) induced hypoglycemia, which was mimicked by interleukin (IL)-1b (25 mg/kg) but not prevented in IL-1RI 2/2 mice, nor by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA; 10 mg/kg). LPS suppression of locomotor activity correlated with blood glucose concentrations, was mitigated by exogenous glucose (2 g/kg), and was exacerbated by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) glycolytic inhibition, despite preventing IL-1b synthesis. Using the ME7 model of chronic neurodegeneration in female mice, to examine vulnerability of the diseased brain to acute stressors, we showed that LPS (100 mg/kg) produced acute cognitive dysfunction, selectively in those animals. These acute cognitive impairments were mimicked by insulin (11.5 IU/kg) and mitigated by glucose, demonstrating that acutely reduced glucose metabolism impairs cognition selectively in the vulnerable brain. To test whether these acute changes might predict altered carbohydrate metabolism during delirium, we assessed glycolytic metabolite levels in CSF in humans during inflammatory trauma-induced delirium. Hip fracture patients showed elevated CSF lactate and pyruvate during delirium, consistent with acutely altered brain energy metabolism. Collectively, the data suggest that disruption of energy metabolism drives behavioral and cognitive consequences of acute systemic inflammation. Acute systemic inflammation alters behavior and produces disproportionate effects, such as delirium, in vulnerable individuals. Delirium has serious short and long-term sequelae but mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that both LPS and interleukin (IL)-1b trigger hypoglycemia, reduce CSF glucose, and suppress spontaneous activity. Exogenous glucose mitigates these outcomes. Equivalent hypoglycemia, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or insulin, was sufficient to trigger cognitive impairment selectively in animals with existing neurodegeneration and glucose also mitigated those impairments. Patient CSF from inflammatory trauma-induced delirium also shows altered brain carbohydrate metabolism. The data suggest that the degenerating brain is exquisitely sensitive to acute behavioral and cognitive consequences of disrupted energy metabolism. Thus "bioenergetic stress" drives systemic inflammation-induced dysfunction. Elucidating this may offer routes to mitigating delirium.

We highlight key factors in designing system solutions -per specific task; as well as design issues in managing the disease on the national level. We focus on three specific use-cases for which AI systems can be built: from the early disease detection, the management of the disease in a hospital setting, and building patient-specific predictive models that require the combination of imaging with additional clinical features. Infrastructure considerations and population modeling in two European countries will be described. This pandemic has made the practical and scientific challenges of making AI solutions very explicit.

306814d1d24e2d69578d34111ca54f89cc7bc4ee	Various semisynthetic derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics including vancomycin, eremomycin, teicoplanin, ristocetin A and DA-40926 have been evaluated for their inhibitory activity against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and human (SARS-CoV, Frankfurt-1 strain) coronavirus in cell culture in comparison with their activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Several glycopeptide derivatives modified with hydrophobic substituents showed selective antiviral activity. For the most active compounds, the 50% effective concentrations (EC 50 ) were in the lower micromolar range. In general, removal of the carbohydrate parts of the molecules did not affect the antiviral activity of the compounds. Some compounds showed inhibitory activity against both, whereas other compounds proved inhibitory to either, FIPV or SARS-CoV. There was no close correlation between the EC 50 values of the glycopeptide derivatives for FIPV or SARS-CoV.
66d3cedc2c96821e0f3a6ad9897c769fb15b2d61	The complete genome of a QX-like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain Sczy3 isolated recently in Sichuan was sequenced. The genome contains 27,695 nucleotides (nt), and possesses a genomic structure similar to other IBV strains. Sequence comparisons demonstrated that the Sczy3 genome had the highest nt sequence identity with QX-like IBVs and was most dissimilar to the Massachusetts type IBV. Differences in the sequences of genes present in the Sczy3 genome and other IBVs gene sequences were also identified. Phylogenic analysis showed that the entire genome and most of the Sczy3 genes were located in the same cluster as LX4. Recombination analysis showed that Sczy3 is a chimeric strain derived from LX4 (major parental sequence) and H120 (minor parental sequence) suggesting that recombination occurred in a region containing the 3 0 terminal 5a sequence (83 nt), the 5 0 terminal 5b sequence (222 nt), and the 5 0 terminal nucleocapsid protein gene sequence (132 nt). Mutations and intergenic recombination may have played an important role in the evolution of IBVs.

The study of this chapter will enable you to: 1. Discuss the definitions of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction and their relation to the illicit use of biological agents. 2. List all legislative and administrative documents that address the legal aspects of the unlawful use of biological agents. 4. Discuss the prohibited uses of biological agents under international law. 5. List and briefly discuss the Homeland Security Presidential Directives that apply to biosecurity and biodefense.
eafd7b7f7ca04655b5c8d62b95fdd572a4e75cc1	The risk of a severe course of COVID-19 is increased in patients suffering with Neuromuscular disorders (NMD) due to the following comorbidities: muscular weakness of the chest and diaphragm, use of ventilator supports and/or presence of tracheostoma, weak airway clearance, cardiac involvement, rhabdomyolysis, comoribities, steroid and immunosuppressant treatments. NMD display varying levels of disability in people with the same diagnosis, thus it is difficult to give COVID-19 related general recommendations. Present advicess were designed for patients, caregivers, general neurologists and non-specialist medical providers. They address frequently asked questions and basic service requirements and are supported by a series of in-depth references. In this truly unprecedented situation, the clinical management of neuromuscular patients during the COVID-19 epidemics -taking into account the related difficulties (patients who have suspended ERT, difficulty in contacting the doctors, etc.) -we propose to use a telemedicine device, i.e. the AIGkit application (AIGkit app), promoted and developed in 2018 by Fabrizio Seidita on behalf of the Italian Glycogenosis Association (AIG). The app was born to allow patients with Pompe disease to receive as far as possible continuous monitoring of their health. The support of all colleagues of the Italian Association for Myology (AIM) should extend its use to all NMD patients and beyond.
8c4233100da83790ea6544851b543977da15a4ca	Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) kill ceils by perturbing the target's plasma membrane and by inducing the disintegration of the target cell's DNA into oligonudeosomal fragments, a process characteristic of apoptosis. We show that the DNA fragmentation event is distinct from the membrane lysis event and is dependent on the state of target cell activation or commitment into the mitotic cycle. Quiescent cells were refractory to DNA fragmentation, but not to membrane lysis. Log phase growth, transformation with c-myc, or infection of quiescent Go targets with herpes simplex virus-l, which induces a competent state for DNA synthesis, all enhanced target cell susceptibility to CTL-induced DNA fragmentation without altering the membrane lysis. These results suggest that Go cells are resistant to CTL-induced apoptosis, but that entry into G1 or a Gl-like state by growth factors, cellular transformation, or DNA virus infection renders them competent to enter the apoptotic pathway(s). W. K. Nishioka would like to thank Drs. J. Campisi, D. Green, E. Martz, and S. Silverstein for insightful discussions; A. Mahboubi for critical reading of the manuscript; M. Cole for the c-myc containing retrovirus; J. Stein for the BALB/c 3T3, done A31 cells; and D. G. Nishioka for support and motivation.
5cee8ca3af3eadb7436bc1c42e52533781b83b15	Recent results supporting the usefulness of the normalized compression distance for the task to classify genome sequences of virus data are reported. Specifically, the problem to cluster the hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of influenza virus data for the HA gene in dependence on the host and subtype of the virus, and the classification of dengue virus genome data with respect to their four serotypes are studied. A comparison is made with respect to hierarchical and spectral clustering via the kLine algorithm by Fischer and Poland (2004) , respectively, and with respect to the standard compressors bzlip, ppmd, and zlib. Our results are very promising and show that one can obtain an (almost) perfect clustering for all the problems studied.
4a074382e2fd63f0f5e882c0014e1e07d61c286a	Plants synthesize and accumulate large amount of specialized (or secondary) metabolites also known as natural products, which provide a rich source for modern pharmacy. In China, plants have been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. Recent development of molecular biology, genomics and functional genomics as well as high-throughput analytical chemical technologies has greatly promoted the research on medicinal plants. In this article, we review recent advances in the elucidation of biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in medicinal plants, including phenylpropanoids, terpenoids and alkaloids. These natural products may share a common upstream pathway to form a limited numbers of common precursors, but are characteristic in distinct modifications leading to highly variable structures. Although this review is focused on traditional Chinese medicine, other plants with a great medicinal interest or potential are also discussed. Understanding of their biosynthesis processes is critical for producing these highly value molecules at large scale and low cost in microbes and will benefit to not only human health but also plant resource conservation.
ee9640d545c977b7b6edeb1b1fd3232b01aa102e	Nuclear energy was adopted in Italy in the past to deal with the insufficient fossil fuels on the national territory. After a public vote subsequent to the Chernobyl accident, Italy abandoned the use of nuclear energy and nowadays adopts a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources for electricity production. However, the urging environmental pollution and climate change issues are forcing Italy to realize a so-called "energy transition" towards a more sustainable energy production and consumption system. In this framework, following the examples of other countries, it could be re-evaluated the adoption of nuclear to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. In the present paper, it is presented an overview of the nuclear energy history in Italy and the current and projected electricity demand and supply. Then, with reference to the Italian framework and policies, the main advantages and disadvantages of a hypothetical reintroduction of nuclear energy are presented. The analysis shows that the adoption of nuclear energy would bring several advantages in terms of lower emissions, higher security of supply and enabling of possible other technologies; the main disadvantages are related to the opposing public opinion and the nuclear waste management.
4dfa3935b8d35c66b4e096f50f462c98232eb729	Introduction: Adipose tissue secretes various bioactive peptides/proteins, immune molecules and inflammatory mediators which are known as adipokines or adipocytokines. Adipokines play important roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, appetite, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammation. Enormous number of studies from all over the world proved that adipocytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases affecting nearly all body systems, which raises the question whether we can always blame adipocytokines as the triggering factor of every disease that may hit the body. Objective: Our review targeted the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems including diabetes mellitus, kidney diseases, gynecological diseases, rheumatologic disorders, cancers, Alzheimer's, depression, muscle disorders, liver diseases, cardiovascular and lung diseases. Methodology: We cited more than 33 recent literature reviews that discussed the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems. Conclusion: More evidence is being discovered to date about the role played by adipocytokines in more diseases and extra research is needed to explore hidden roles played by adipokine imbalance on disease pathogenesis.
35228086f00af6da6b45bd5c7b576ee8ddac1f2a	Viral infections are common complications of pregnancy, with a wide range of obstetric and neonatal sequelae. Currently, there are limited data on whether SARS-CoV-2 is vertically transmitted in pregnant women tested positive for the virus. Here we describe a case of a known SARS-CoV-2-positive woman giving preterm birth to two fetuses with SARS-CoV-2 positive testing in placental tissue and amniotic fluid. The placental histological examinations showed chronic intervillositis and extensive intervillous fibrin depositions with ischemic necrosis of the surrounding villi.

Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacity of RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Here, we developed and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed. We also adapted a colorimetric detection method for our RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput.
2f1c3732a47c58c94a6b6effa38d234b51a6a283	SARS-Cov2 infection has recently spread to Italy with important consequences on pregnancy management, mother and child health and mother-child contact. Breastfeeding improves the health of mother and child and reduces risk of neonatal infection with other pathogens that are likely to cause serious illness. To date no evidence confirmed COVID-19 vertical transmission from infected pregnant mother to their fetus. However it is well known that an infected mother can transmit the COVID-19 virus through respiratory droplets during breastfeeding or intimate contact. Thus, the mothers with known or suspected COVID-19 should adhere to standard and contact precautions during breastfeeding. Woman Study Group of AMD, after reviewing current knowledge about COVID-19 vertical transmission and the compatibility of breastfeeding in COVID-19 mother, the available recommendations from Health Care Organizations and main experts opinions, issued the following suggestions on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, addressed both to mothers with and without diabetes It should be considered that following suggestions may change in the future when more evidence is acquired regarding SARS-Cov2 infection.
c55673c3552e39001f2e6af8f36b60ca75e6f577	Background: Health care-associated infections most commonly result from person-to-person transmission via the hands of health care workers. We studied the efficacy of hand hygiene agents (n = 14) following 10-second applications to reduce the level of challenge organisms (Serratia marcescens and MS2 bacteriophage) from the hands of healthy volunteers using the ASTM-E-1174-94 test method. Results: The highest log 10 reductions of S marcescens were achieved with agents containing chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), triclosan, benzethonium chloride, and the controls, tap water alone and nonantimicrobial soap and water (episode 1 of hand hygiene, 1.60-2.01; episode 10, 1.60-3.63). Handwipes but not alcohol-based handrubs were significantly inferior from these agents after a single episode of hand hygiene, but both groups were significantly inferior after 10 episodes. After a single episode of hand hygiene, alcohol/silver iodide, CHG, triclosan, and benzethonium chloride were similar to the controls in reduction of MS2, but, in general, handwipes and alcohol-based handrubs showed significantly lower efficacy. After 10 episodes, only benzethonium chloride (1.33) performed as well as the controls (1.59-1.89) in the reduction of MS2. Conclusions: Antimicrobial handwashing agents were the most efficacious in bacterial removal, whereas waterless agents showed variable efficacy. Alcohol-based handrubs compared with other products demonstrated better efficacy after a single episode of hand hygiene than after 10 episodes. Effective hand hygiene for high levels of viral contamination with a nonenveloped virus was best achieved by physical removal with a nonantimicrobial soap or tap water alone.

f5ae3f66face323615df39d838e056ab5fcc98df	Background: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important cause of acute respiratory illness in young children. Whole genome sequencing enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub-genomic sequences. Results: We report a 2-reaction amplicon-based next generation sequencing method to determine the complete genome sequences of five HMPV strains, representing three subgroups (A2, B1 and B2), directly from clinical samples. In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes. We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3 and 80% for HMPV group A and B, respectively, the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes, and multiple subgroups co-circulated in various countries. Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length (219 to 241 amino acids) due to changes in the stop codon position. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and M2 genes. Conclusion: This is the first genomic characterization of HMPV genomes from African patients.
0723b516b9eb3b535c387cc1a67e6fdb51ca88a1	The trajectory of critical ethical reflection on technology has been from big issues (eighteenth century arguments for social revolution responding to the evils of the industrial revolution) to small ones (particular issues associated with the practices of engineers). It is time again to think in large-scale terms. Keywords Ethics of technology Á Engineering Á Philosophy of technology Á Socialism Let us jump back to 1603, the year of the death of Queen Elizabeth the first. William Shakespeare was at the peak of his creative genius as tragic dramaturge, having just produced Hamlet and on the verge of writing Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth. James VI of Scotland ascended the throne as James I of England and Ireland, and would sponsor the ''King James'' translation of the Bible. It was a period of unparalleled English aesthetic achievement.

Miniaturization initially focused on devices that contained micrometer-sized features designed for a particular analytical purpose (e.g., filters for cell isolation and chips for capillary electrophoresis). Now, the focus is shifting to analytical applications based on nano-sized objects such as nanotubes, nanochannels, nanoparticles, nanopores and nanocapacitors.

e30f5f76a403e0a60d32f941c32fb5e0cd08c458	n our previous study, we have shown that canine coronavirus type II (CCoV-II) activates both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a canine fibrosarcoma cell line (A-72 cells). Herein we investigated the role of Sirtuin and Forkhead box O (FOXO) families in this experimental model using Nortern Blot and Western Blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that mitochondrial SIRT3 and SIRT4 protein expression increased from 12 and 24 h post infection (p.i.) onwards, respectively, whereas the nuclear SIRT1 expression increased during the first 12 h p.i. followed by a decrease after 36 h p.i., reaching the same level of control at 48 h p.i. Sirtuins interact with/and regulate the activity of FOXO family proteins, and we herein observed that FOXO3A and FOXO1 expression increased significantly and stably from 12 h p.i. onwards. In addition, CCoV-II induces a remarkable increase in the expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), while we observed a slight up-regulation of FasL/Fas at 36 p.i. with a decrease of both proteins at the end of infection. Furthermore, we found that virus infection increased both bax translocation into mitochondria and decreased bcl-2 expression in cytosol in a timedependent manner. These data suggest that FOXO transcription factors mediate pro-apoptotic effects of CCoV-II, in part due to activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathway, while some Sirtuin family members (such as SIRT3 and SIRT4) may be involved in intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, these results propose that TRAIL is an important mediator of cell death induced by CCoV-II during in vitro infection.
a497dea73b329a11331c9835fabff84a7e5eedcd	The characteristics of human genomics and cellular immune function between clinically symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and controls were systematically compared to explore the immunologic pathogenesis of VTE. Microarray assay showed the mRNA expressions of genes related to non-specific cellarer immune and cytokines were significantly down-regulated. Abnormal expressions of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, NK marker CD16+56+, CD19 and aberrant CD4+/CD8+ ratio were detected in 54 among 56 patients. In PE patients, microarray assay revealed the imbalance in the expressions of genes related to the immune system. The expressions of genes related to non-specific immune cells and cytokines were markedly up-regulated and those associated with cellular immune were dramatically down-regulated. In VTE patients, cytological examination indicated the functions of NK cells were significantly compromised, and the antigen recognition and killing function of T cells markedly decreased. The consistence between genomic and cytological examination suggests the symptomatic VTE is closely associated with the infection and immune dysfunction.

42fa2baebd4494662f03692017a4ded2eb92d19b	Positron emission tomography (PET), is a medical imaging technique that provides functional information about physiological processes. The goal of PET is to reconstruct the distribution of the radioisotopes in the body by measuring the emitted photons. The computer methods are designed to solve the inverse problem known as "image reconstruction from projections." In this paper, an iterative image reconstruction algorithm ART was regularized by combining Tikhonov and total variation regularizations. In the first step, combined regularization algorithm of total variation and Tikhonov regularization was applied to the image obtained by ART algorithm in each iteration for background noise removal with preserving edges. The quality measurements and visual inspections show a significant improvement in image quality compared to other algorithms.

fa14a8a891d83506e7af12eceda09cfc63234147	• Food-borne zoonoses are infectious diseases of major health and economic significance in developed countries. In order to protect consumers' health and to enhance the management of food-borne zoonotic agents from primary production to consumption, new regulations have been issued in the European Union. These Regulations notably require information concerning each step from farm to slaughterhouse. Today, pork is the most frequently consumed meat in Europe. • In this context, the purpose of this review was to collect information on risk factors on pig farms regarding the prevalence of four bacterial hazards responsible for frequent and/or serious pork-borne diseases: Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica. Among the risk factors described in the literature, feed, herd management and biosecurity measures have been shown to greatly impact the prevalence of these hazards. These risk factors may be used as information on the primary production of the pork food chain transmitted from farm to slaughterhouse. • The application of good hygiene practices in herds is paramount to reduce the risk of presence of food-borne pathogens. As a priority in biosecurity measures, limiting the mixing of pig batches is needed. These measures must be implemented to reduce the presence of pathogens in the first step in the pork food chain. The Hygiene Package and Regulation EC-2160/2003 require information flow from farm to slaughterhouse to enhance European consumers protection in a 'farm to fork' approach. This obligation especially concerns food-borne zoonotic hazards transmitted to humans through pork consumption, such as thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica. Prevalence estimates of these four hazards are affected by the sampling strategy and diagnostic procedure. Individual prevalence estimates for pig carriage (from digestive contents or lymph nodes collected at slaughterhouse) were higher than individual prevalence estimates for pig shedding (from faeces). Among risk factors described in the literature, poor pen cleaning and disinfection after pig departure to slaughterhouse and poor bio-security measures are of major significance. Moreover, whereas wet feed increases the risk of pig infection by L. monocytogenes, dry feed is a risk factor for Salm. enterica. Mixing batches of pigs, notably in fattening herds, represents a risk for the transmission of Salm. enterica and Y. enterocolitica. Whereas small herds are more infected by thermophilic campylobacters and Y. enterocolitica, higher prevalence of Salmonella is observed in large herds due to a more frequent mixing of batches. Antibiotic treatment during the finishing period increases
272c86bee233aeae771807ee609256fe9e61f650	Purpose of Review The purpose of this review is to describe and assess the literature on mobile health (mHealth) and other technology-based HIV testing interventions published in the 5-year period from 2015 to 2020. Recent Findings We identified 18 published technology-based studies, 6 of which were efficacy trials and the remaining 12 were either pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies. Most (n = 10) interventions were conducted outside the USA, including countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 4), China (n = 3), Latin America (n = 2), and India (n = 1). All efficacy trials showed some evidence of efficacy, although uptake of HIV testing was low among in intervention trials that consisted of a low number of text messages. Most pilot RCTs demonstrated high levels of feasibility and acceptability, as well as some evidence that the intervention participants benefited more than the control group. Many non-randomized trials similarly reported positive appraisal by study participants. Recommendations for future research and practice by the authors of the studies reviewed here are summarized. Summary Technology-assisted HIV testing interventions may be an important strategy to reach national and global targets for HIV status awareness in the general population and for most at-risk groups. Although there appears to be growing evidence of their benefit, questions linger regarding how to leverage existing social media platforms to promote HIV testing, which interventions work for what populations, and best practices for scaling up mHealth and other technology-based interventions.
e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	Currently there is no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which frequently leads to fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury. Here, we discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated inflammation. We also assume that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses. Potential therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2 -induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.
d4b5a78a1ab61e4e94bf8478c47e6f5e2ef33086	Background: Isatis indigotica, the source of the traditional Chinese medicine Radix isatidis (Ban-Lan-Gen), is an extremely important economical crop in China. To facilitate biological, biochemical and molecular research on the medicinal chemicals in I. indigotica, here we report the first I. indigotica transcriptome generated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Results: RNA-seq library was created using RNA extracted from a mixed sample including leaf and root. A total of 33,238 unigenes were assembled from more than 28 million of high quality short reads. The quality of the assembly was experimentally examined by cDNA sequencing of seven randomly selected unigenes. Based on blast search 28,184 unigenes had a hit in at least one of the protein and nucleotide databases used in this study, and 8 unigenes were found to be associated with biosynthesis of indole and its derivatives. According to Gene Ontology classification, 22,365 unigenes were categorized into 48 functional groups. Furthermore, Clusters of Orthologous Group and Swiss-Port annotation were assigned for 7,707 and 18,679 unigenes, respectively. Analysis of repeat motifs identified 6,400 simple sequence repeat markers in 4,509 unigenes. Conclusion: Our data provide a comprehensive sequence resource for molecular study of I. indigotica. Our results will facilitate studies on the functions of genes involved in the indole alkaloid biosynthesis pathway and on metabolism of nitrogen and indole alkaloids in I. indigotica and its related species.
5bf2ab79a25fdb03f50dafb0d08de60acbd50af0	The emergence of neurotropic Zika virus (ZIKV) raised a public health emergency of global concern. ZIKV can cross the placental barrier and infect foetal brains, resulting in microcephaly, but the pathogenesis of ZIKV is poorly understood. With recent findings reporting AXL as a type I interferon antagonist rather than an entry receptor, the exact entry mechanism remains unresolved. Here we report that cell surface sialic acid plays an important role in ZIKV infection. Removal of cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase significantly abolished ZIKV infection in Vero cells and human induced-pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, knockout of the sialic acid biosynthesis gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase resulted in significantly less ZIKV infection of both African and Asian lineages. Huh7 cells deficient in α2,3-linked sialic acid through knockout of ST3 βgalactoside-α2,3-sialyltransferase 4 had significantly reduced ZIKV infection. Removal of membrane-bound, uninternalized virus with pronase treatment revealed the role of sialic acid in ZIKV internalization but not attachment. Sialyllactose inhibition studies showed that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV, implying that sialic acid could be mediating ZIKV-receptor complex internalization. Identification of α2,3-linked sialic acid as an important host factor for ZIKV internalization provides new insight into ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.

Immunol,lmmunopathol,, 5: 377-387, class-specific antibodies against bovine IgOl, IgG2, IgM and IgA and porcine IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins were prepared. Their class specificity was assessed by two radioimmunological methods, nameIy, radioimmunoelectrophoresis and double antibody sandwich radioimmunoassay. The methods are highIy specific and sensitive and do not require the use of purified immunoglobulins, but can be performed with normai serum or colostrum. It was confirmed that antibodies found satisfactory in these tests were suitable for a wide range of use including radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
13ccf8271af099cb86ef23b4441e0ef9f77bb4ec	Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 late in 2019 (also named as COVID-19 or novel coronavirus 2019 or nCoV2019. Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.
17473d144b25b1afab4d6e98b4b8de2ab7507679	1. Further detail on assembly and screening of "NITD parasite box". In previous work we have screened several large compound libraries against blood stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites and identified a number of novel active scaffolds and successfully advanced two new antimalarial drug candidates to the clinic 36 . Our P. falciparum phenotypic screening efforts identified multiple new targets including the ATP-dependent sodium channel PfATP4 9 , phosphatidylinositol-4-OH-kinase 12 , and lysyl-tRNA synthetase 37 . While Cryptosporidium is an early branching member of the Apicomplexa and exhibits phylogenetic divergence from other members of the phylum, several druggable targets are conserved 38,39 . To explore functional conservation of targets and pathways across parasites and to identify lead candidates against Cryptosporidium, we have assembled a "NITD parasite box" and screened it against C. parvum as described in the Supplementary Table 1. The "NITD parasite box" is a diversity set of 6220 non-cytotoxic (HepG2 SI > 20) and non-reactive compounds identified in a variety of antiparasitic drug discovery projects among them P. falciparum phenotypic screening hits and compounds from 11 diverse scaffolds both active and inactive hits against P. falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei that inhibit the growth/viability of C. parvum in HCT-8 cells. During the screening the average infection rate of HCT-8 cells was 69% and the average z-factor of 0.74 compared to uninfected controls. We have observed a positive correlation between two replicates with an r 2 of the regression 0.831. The scatter plot of 6220 compounds with mean % inhibition is shown Fig 1a. We identified 154 new chemical entities (NCEs) that inhibited C. parvum infection by more than 3x SD from the mean of DMSO-treated controls, resulting in a 2.5 % hit rate. These 154 hits represented multiple compounds from Pf phenotypic screening hits and a few scaffolds active against PfPI(4)K, PfKRS etc. None of the Trypanosoma active hits showed activity against C. parvum. In this manuscript we focused our efforts on the pyrazolopyridine scaffold.
bec0df56a9525ba837a2cf3e67831a3b2abb8d08	Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the causative pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which may cause severe neurological and cardiopulmonary complications in children. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, management strategy, and clinical outcomes of cardiopulmonary failure (CPF) in patients with EV-A71 infection. The pathogenesis of CPF involves both catecholamine-related cardiotoxicity following brainstem encephalitis and vasodilatory shock due to cytokine storm. Sympathetic hyperactivity, including tachycardia and hypertension, are the early clinical manifestations of cardiopulmonary involvement, which may progress to pulmonary edema/ hemorrhage and/or CPF. The management strategy comprises multidisciplinary supportive treatment, including fluid management, positive pressure ventilation support, and use of milrinone, vasopressors, and inotropes. Some patients may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Major neurological sequelae are almost inevitable once a child develops life-threatening illness. Long-term care of these children is an important medico-social issue.
7b21c42b570e25e1de81a7c86caf993b5d669388	24 COVID-19 is characterised by dysregulated immune responses, metabolic dysfunction and 25 adverse effects on the function of multiple organs. To understand how host responses 26 contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology, we used a multi-omics approach to identify 27 molecular markers in peripheral blood and plasma samples that distinguish COVID-19 28 patients experiencing a range of disease severities. A large number of expressed genes, 29 proteins, metabolites and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) were identified that exhibited strong 30 associations with various clinical parameters. Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and 31 exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients, indicative of multi-organ damage. 32 The continuous activation of IFN-I signalling and neutrophils, as well as a high level of 33 inflammatory cytokines, were observed in severe disease patients. In contrast, COVID-19 in 34 mild patients was characterised by robust T cell responses. Finally, we show that some of 35 expressed genes, proteins and exRNAs can be used as biomarkers to predict the clinical 36 outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data refine our understanding of the 37 pathophysiology and clinical progress of COVID-19 and will help guide future studies in this 38 area. 39 40
45487498be4bd6cac337602811bebae0940614e6	To better support the surveillance of infectious disease and epidemic outbreaks by public health professionals, we design and implement BioPortal, an advanced Web-based system for cross-jurisdictional information sharing and integration. In this paper, we report two empirical studies that evaluate the outcomes, task performance efficiency, user information satisfaction, and usability associated with BioPortal. Overall, our results suggest that the use of BioPortal can improve users' surveillance performance as measured by analysis accuracy and efficiency (i.e., the amount of time required to complete an analysis task). Our subjects were highly satisfied with the information support of BioPortal and considered it reasonably usable. Our evaluation findings show the effectiveness and value of BioPortal and, at the same time, shed light on several areas where its design can further improve. Surveillance of an infectious disease or an epidemic outbreak is information intensive and can be greatly supported by effective collection, integration, analysis, and visualization of diverse and voluminous data that are heterogeneous and stored in various sources spanning jurisdictional constituencies horizontally and vertically [5] . A systems-based approach to support important surveillance tasks is appealing. Yasnoff et al. [6] highlight the importance of fruitful collaborations among researchers and practitioners in public health and information systems. We designed and implemented BioPortal [7], a Web-based system that supports convenient access to distributed, cross-jurisdictional health data about several infectious diseases that include WNV, FMD, and Botulism. Specifically, BioPortal supports seamless data integration across different system platforms, contains advanced spatiotemporal data analysis functionalities, and has intuitive, effective visualization capabilities. Preliminary results show encouraging effectiveness of BioPortal, which however needs to be further assessed systematically and methodologically. In this paper, we report two empirical evaluation studies of BioPortal that focus on outcome, task performance efficiency, user information satisfaction, and system usability. The first study is a controlled experiment that involves 33 graduate students and includes a prevalent spreadsheet-based system for benchmark purposes. The second study is a field evaluation that includes 3 experienced public health professionals affiliated with the State Health Services department in the United States. Overall, our results suggest that the use of BioPortal can improve users' surveillance performance measured by analysis accuracy and efficiency (i.e., the amount of time required to complete an analysis task). Our subjects are highly satisfied with the information support of BioPortal and consider it reasonably usable. Our findings show the effectiveness and value of BioPortal and, at the same time, shed light on several areas where its design can further improve. BioPortal is loosely coupled with state public health information systems in California and New York. Each source system transmits WNV and/or botulism related data through secure links to BioPortal using mutually agreed upon protocols. Architecturally, BioPortal is comprised of a Web portal, an internal data store, and a communication backbone. The Web portal provides the necessary user interfaces and allows users to search or query infectious disease-related data sets, visualize these data and analysis results in an intuitive spatiotemporal fashion, perform analysis tasks using built-in analytical models and functions, and identify alerts that signal the development or emergence of "hot spots." HL7 standards are used as the main storage format to support the necessary data interoperability. All participating agencies transmit data to BioPortal as HL7compliant XML messages through a secured network connection. HL7 XML-based standards are more advantageous than alternative methods that demand the internal data store to consolidate and maintain the data fields in the respective data sets and sources, hereby offering greater system scalability and extensibility. The communication backbone supports secure data exchanges between BioPortal and each data source. This backbone is built upon widely recognized national standards and
ff6f7ec41fcfb1353aea25253c33ae25469f6a07	In 2003 the UK National Blood Service introduced a policy of 'male donor preference' which involved women's plasma being discarded following blood collection. The policy was based on the view that data relating to the incidence of Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) was linked to transfusion with women's plasma. While appearing to treat female donors as equal to male donors, exclusion criteria operate after donation at the stage of processing blood, thus perpetuating myths of universality even though only certain 'extractions' from women are retained for use in transfusion. Many women in the UK receive a plasmaderived product called Anti-D immunoglobulin which is manufactured from pooled male plasma. This article examines ways in which gender has significance for understanding blood relations, and how the blood economy is gendered. In our study of relations between blood donors and recipients, we explore how gendered bodies are produced through the discursive and material practices within blood services. We examine both how donation policies and the manufacturing and use of blood products produces gendered blood relations.
b9690248a56a52e5da485b5105b19f23d88f2e8b	This article discusses the theoretical and practical experiment of creating, promoting and co-teaching a medical humanities course: Medicine, War and the Arts at a School of Medicine in the United States from the viewpoint of the students who took the class. Specifically, it analyses how three themes emerged in students' responses to the oral, literary and visual stories of war and trauma in the course and how they revealed the subjective and ambivalent nature of all medical encounters with patients. The conclusion is that actively encouraging students to view the role of the physician through the lens of historical and contemporary trauma enables them to contemplate the difficult question, "Who's Your Enemy?" when caring for the sick and themselves. For seven years I was in charge of creating and teaching a medical humanities curriculum at a school of medicine in the United States. During their final two clinical years, all students were required to take one of the seven medical humanities courses. These were one-month seminars, always co-taught by a MD and a Ph.D. with a class size of fifteen to twenty students. 1 The courses met every weekday for three hours in a seminar-like setting. What follows is an analysis from 2014 of findings from one particular course that required students to read, to reflect upon and to discuss stories of trauma. Amongst the offerings in the curriculum is a course titled, Medicine, War and the Arts. This interdisciplinary course focuses on artistic depictions, literary accounts, and oral testimonials of trauma from the Napoleonic era to the present. It has been co-taught by a cardiothoracic surgeon who is a retired US Army Reserve Colonel and myself (a medical historian and former trauma nurse) on a regular basis. Stories of historical and contemporary trauma appear in many guises throughout the course: as poems, paintings, diaries, recordings, films, and material Journal of Medical Humanities
de686acc77143c1fa2a9f3a5d19a3c7aa230a9ff	Infectomics, a novel way to globally and comprehensively understand the interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts, has significantly expanded understanding of the microbial infections. The infectomics view of viral-host interactions on the viral perspective principally focuses on gene acquisition, deletion, and point mutation, while traditional antiviral drug discovery concentrates on viral encoding proteins. Recently, high-throughput technologies, such as mass spectrometry-based proteomics, activity-based protein profiling, microarray analysis, yeast two-hybrid assay, small interfering RNA screening, and micro RNA profiling, have been gradually employed in the research of virus-host interactions. Besides, signaling pathways and cellular processes involved in viral-host interactions provide new insights of infectomics in antiviral drug discovery. In this review, we summarize related infectomics approaches in the studies of virus-host interactions, which shed light on the development of novel antiviral drug targets screening.

e3b74d02ad582540a4afc22af36380781e20fb8f	Background/Case Studies: 19 different monoclonal anti-D reagents have been tested in humans, but have not shown equivalent efficacy as donor derived polyclonal anti-D. In addition, some monoclonal anti-D results in a paradoxical enhancement of alloimmunization, an effect also seen with donor derived anti-D in some cases. K1 transgenic mice express the human K1 RBC alloantigen selectively on RBCs. Wild-type mice become alloimmunized to K1 RBCs, when exposed through either transfusion or pregnancy, the latter leading to HDFN. Analogous to anti-D in humans, polyclonal mouse serum derived anti-K1 prevents alloimmunization. Thus, the K1 mouse serves as a model of antibody mediated immune regulation of alloimmunization. Study Design/Methods: IgG subtype was isolated as an independent variable by engineering a panel of IgG subtype switch variants for a monoclonal anti-K1. Monoclonal anti-K1 was isolated for each murine IgG subtype (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c and IgG3) and each with the same antigenbinding domain. The effects of IgG subtype on clearance and alloimmunization to transfused K1 RBCs was tested. The role of FcgRIIb (the inhibitory FcgR in mice and humans) was tested using FcgRIIb KO mice. The role of activating FcgRs (aFcgR) was tested using a novel conditional knockout mouse (Con-FcgR) where the common gamma chain (required for expression of all murine aFcgRs) is deleted upon exposure to CRE recombinase. Results/Findings: Significant clearance of K11 RBCs was observed with IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2c, but not IgG2b or IgG3. IgG1 and IgG3 significantly decrease, whereas IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG2c increased anti-K1 alloimmunization. IgG1 and IgG2c were further studied, as examples of suppressing and enhancing antibodies. In FcgRIIb KO mice, clearance was unaffected, suppression by IgG1 was eliminated, and enhancement by IgG2a was not altered. When aFcgRs were deleted in all tissues, no clearance was observed with either subtype, enhancement by IgG2c was eliminated, and suppression by IgG1 was unaffected. Tissue specific deletion of aFcgRs demonstrated that aFcgR expression on dendritic cells (DCs) [and not macrophages] was required for enhancement by IgG2c. Conclusion: Similar to what is observed in humans, some monoclonal anti-RBC antibodies prevented alloimmunization whereas others enhanced. IgG subtype determined inhibition vs. enhancement. Inhibition by IgG1 functions through an FcgRIIb dependent mechanism. Also, lack of clearance but maintenance of suppression by IgG1 in mice lacking aFcgRs indicates clearance is not required for suppression, a finding consistent with data from other murine and some human studies. Enhancement by IgG2a requires expression of aFcgRs by DCs. Follow up studies will be required to see if these findings translate into humans. Background/Case Studies: Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) remains the most common cause of death from blood transfusion therapy. A mouse model of TRALI relies on the administration of a MHC Class I (MHC I) monoclonal antibody (mAb) to mice with cognate MHC I antigen; however, the critical site(s) of cognate antigen expression have not been elucidated. We hypothesized that endothelial expression of MHC I is necessary for the development of TRALI. Study Design/Method: Conditional MHC I knockout mice on the C57Bl/6 background were generated by crossing floxed beta2 microglobulin mice (B2mFlox) to a congenic H-2K d expressing C57Bl/6 mouse (C-H2 d ) and to cell-specific Cre strains to delete MHC I in myeloid cells (LysM-Cre), endothelial cells (VECadherin-CreERT2) and platelets (PF4-Cre). TRALI was modeled by the injection of a MHC I mAb (H-2K d ; 34-1-2S) into LPS-primed mice (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). Lung injury was measured using extravascular lung water and lung vascular permeability to 125 I-labelled albumin. To measure the endothelial expression of MHC I within the lung, the left lung was removed for MHC I quantification using flow cytometry. One week after pneumonectomy, these mice were challenged with the TRALI model. Results/Finding: C-H2 d mice are susceptible to TRALI with no significance difference in excess lung water (109 vs. 87 ml, p5NS) and lung vascular permeability (135 vs. 102 ml, p5NS) compared to BALB/c wild-type controls. C-H2 d x B2mFlox x PF4-Cre mice that lack MHC I expression on platelets are fully susceptible to TRALI and show no significant difference in excess lung water (88 vs. 81 ml, p5NS), lung vascular permeability (114 vs. 101 ml, p5NS), lung neutrophil-platelet aggregate formation (2.9 vs. 2.6%, p5NS) or survival at 2 hours (71 vs. 58%, p5NS by log-rank test) compared to C-H2 d x B2mFlox controls. C-H2 d x B2mFlox x VECadherinCreERT2 mice have reduced MHC I expression on lung endothelial cells after neonatal tamoxifen administration (MFI reduction 43 1/-17%, p50.04 vs. C-H2 d x B2mFlox control). With TRALI challenge, Tamoxifen-treated C-H2 d x B2mFlox x VECadherinCreERT2 mice with low-to-intermediate expression of MHC I have a significant reduction in excess lung water (49 vs. 89 ml, p50.01) and lung vascular permeability (31 vs. 63 ml, p50.04) compared to controls with high levels of MHC I expression. C-H2 d x B2mFlox x LysMCremice lack MHC I expression on neutrophils and experiments on susceptibility to TRALI are ongoing. Conclusion: TRALI results from cognate antibody recognition of endothelial MHC I. The vast endothelial surface area of the lung and the first-pass of transfused blood products through the lung may explain the pulmonaryrestricted organ injury after transfused cognate antibody.
2861b42581ef5a1328924abe2c819b21b5d6e6e1	Objective: To develop a multi-channel device event segmentation and feature extraction algorithm that is robust to changes in data distribution. Methods: We introduce an adaptive transfer learning algorithm to classify and segment events from non-stationary multi-channel temporal data. Using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) the algorithm adaptively adjusts to shifts in distribution over time. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised and learns to label events without requiring a priori information about true event states. The procedure is illustrated on experimental data collected from a cohort in a human viral challenge (HVC) study, where certain subjects have disrupted wake and sleep patterns after exposure to a H1N1 influenza pathogen. Results: Simulations establish that the proposed adaptive algorithm significantly outperforms other event classification methods. When applied to early time points in the HVC data the algorithm extracts sleep/wake features that are predictive of both infection and infection onset time. Conclusion: The proposed transfer learning event segmentation method is robust to temporal shifts in data distribution and can be used to produce highly discriminative event-labeled features for health monitoring. Significance: Our integrated multisensor signal processing and transfer learning method is applicable to many ambulatory monitoring applications. 1
20322636a45c9b0a4e424c1bb216637522dba2d9	SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family that is the causal pathogen of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19. l We mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome l We discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronaviruses l We predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning tool
3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a	Flavivirus methyltransferase is a genetically-validated antiviral target. Crystal structures of almost all available flavivirus methyltransferases contain S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the methyl donor molecule that co-purifies with the enzymes. This raises a possibility that SAM is an integral structural component required for the folding of dengue virus (DENV) methyltransferase. Here we exclude this possibility by solving the crystal structure of DENV methyltransferase without SAM. The SAM ligand was removed from the enzyme through a urea-mediated denaturation-and-renaturation protocol. The crystal structure of the SAM-depleted enzyme exhibits a vacant SAM-binding pocket, with a conformation identical to that of the SAM-enzyme co-crystal structure. Functionally, equivalent enzymatic activities (N-7 methylation, 2 0 -O methylation, and GMP-enzyme complex formation) were detected for the SAM-depleted and SAMcontaining recombinant proteins. These results clearly indicate that the SAM molecule is not an essential component for the correct folding of DENV methyltransferase. Furthermore, the results imply a potential antiviral approach to search for inhibitors that can bind to the SAM-binding pocket and compete against SAM binding. To demonstrate this potential, we have soaked crystals of DENV methyltransferase without a bound SAM with the natural product Sinefungin and show that preformed crystals are capable of binding ligands in this pocket.

d9ce618ef6a804f2fc4c32f5759b340ff16de69c	Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to lead to poor outcomes in the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease, obesity or metabolic syndrome. Here we consider mechanisms by which dyslipidemia and the use of cholesterol-modifying drugs could influence the virushost relationship. Cholesterol is essential for the assembly, replication and infectivity of enveloped virus particles; we highlight several cholesterol-modifying drugs with the potential to alter the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle that could be tested in in vitro and in vivo models. Although cholesterol is an essential component of immune cell membranes, excess levels can dysregulate protective immunity and promote exaggerated pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses. Statins block the production of multiple sterols, oxysterols and isoprenoids, resulting in a pleotropic range of context-dependent effects on virus infectivity, immunity and inflammation. We highlight antiviral, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of cholesterol-modifying drugs that merit further consideration in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
c10b7a9e33eafc951ff2bbbe44ef86a75895f917	SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory co-infections may occur. As Mycoplasma pneumoniae and various viruses can cause cold agglutinin disease (CAD), the presence of CAD in COVID-19 patients should indicate the need of investigations for those pathogens.
f62d6cfd82d37b21edee19f95cd253094fc58e68	Background: Professional caregivers working in child and youth welfare institutions are frequently faced with the complex mental health issues, emotional needs and challenging coping strategies of clients with cumulated traumatic experiences, leaving them prone to developing high levels of stress, burn-out and compassion fatigue. Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a milieu-therapeutic approach that aims to promote the self-efficacy and self-care of youth welfare staff by guiding them to a better understanding of their own and their clients' stress symptoms and countertransference. Despite increasing efforts to implement TIC practices, and more widespread recognition of their value in youth welfare systems, there is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of this approach. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of TIC practices in youth welfare institutions on both the physiological stress of staff members and clients' physical aggression towards their caregivers. . Data was obtained from a longitudinal study investigating the effectiveness of TIC in 14 residential youth welfare institutions. Our sample consisted of 47 youth welfare employees (66.0% female) aged from 23 to 60 years (M = 37.4, SD = 10.4 years). Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and occurrences of client physical aggression were assessed at four annual measurement time points (T1 to T4). Results: Participants in five institutions employing TIC practices (intervention group) showed significantly lower HCC at T4 than staff members from institutions who did not receive training in TIC (control group), indicating reduced physiological stress levels. At T4, the intervention group reported significantly less physical aggression than the control group. Conclusions: TIC might be a promising approach for reducing the emotional burden of employees and institutions should invest in training their staff in TIC practices. More research is necessary, to investigate the benefits and efficacy of TIC, both to youths and staff members, and to foster a better understanding of which specific factors may contribute to stress reduction.
c24147d477e3b1e01c3567a3f983a178a224f4a3	Severe immunosuppression is a hallmark of Morbillivirus infections. To study the underlying mechanisms, we have developed a ferret model of canine distemper virus infection. The model reproduces all clinical signs of measles, but the lack of ferret-specific reagents has limited the characterization of the cellular immune response. Towards this, we cloned ferret cytokines and established semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays. To demonstrate the utility of these assays we compared the cytokine profiles elicited by lethal and non-lethal strains during the prodromal phase. We observed a general lack of cytokine induction in animals that later succumbed to the disease, whereas survivors mounted a robust and sustained response. The newly developed cytokine assays strengthen and expand the ferret model not only for Morbillivirus pathogenesis studies but also for several other human respiratory viruses including influenza and SARS.
543c7c6ef37d5c899b6ca2d88984b16dc5b4d6b3	Coronavirus disease 2019 was first diagnosed in Colombia from a traveler arriving from Italy on February 26, 2020. To date, available data on the origins and number or introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the country are limited. Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 43 clinical samples and-together with another 73 genomes sequences available from the country-we investigated the emergence and the routes of importation of COVID-19 into Colombia using epidemiological, historical air travel and phylogenetic observations. Our study provided evidence of multiple introductions, mostly from Europe, with at least 12 lineages being documented. Phylogenetic findings validated the linkage of epidemiologically-linked transmission chains. Our results demonstrate the advantages of genome sequencing to complement COVID-19 outbreak investigation and underscores that human mobility and genetic data are relevant to complete epidemiological investigation and better characterize virus transmission dynamics at local scales.
a6242836403690b2ebca0fa1e616a044caddc9e7	Background: Observational studies have suggested increased arrhythmic and cardiovascular risk with the combination use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: The arrhythmic safety profile of HCQ monotherapy, which remains under investigation as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent in COVID-19, is less established and we sought to evaluate this. In 245 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the University of Washington hospital system between March 9 and May 10, 2020, we identified 111 treated with HCQ monotherapy. Patients treated with HCQ underwent a systematic arrhythmia and QT interval surveillance protocol including serial electrocardiograms (ECG) (baseline, following second HCQ dose). The primary endpoint was inhospital sustained ventricular arrhythmia or arrhythmic cardiac arrest. Secondary endpoints included clinically significant QTc prolongation. A total of 111 patients with COVID-19 underwent treatment with HCQ monotherapy (mean age 62±16 years, 44 women [39%], serum creatinine 0.9 [interquartile range 0.4] mg/dL). There were no instances of sustained ventricular arrythmia or arrhythmic cardiac arrest. In 75 patients with serial ECGs, clinically significant QTc prolongation was observed in a minority (N=5 [7%]). In patients with serial ECGs, there was no significant change in the QTc interval in pre-specified subgroups of interest, including those with prevalent cardiovascular disease or baseline use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis inhibitors. In the context of a systematic monitoring protocol, HCQ monotherapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was not associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. A minority of patients demonstrated clinically significant QTc prolongation during HCQ therapy.
5e893d78ef1933799dbaaf1584ba4a627723ce6f	Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients are driven by "cytokine storms" and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interim clinical trial results suggest that the corticosteroid dexamethasone displays superior 28-day survival in severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen. Among 16 patients with plasma IL-6 measurement post-corticosteroid administration, a higher proportion of patients with an IL-6 value over 10 pg/mL have worse outcomes (i.e. ICU Length of Stay > 15 days or death) when compared to 41 patients treated with non-corticosteroid drugs including antivirals, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine (p-value = 0.0024). Given this unexpected clinical association between post-corticosteroid IL-6 levels and COVID-19 severity, we hypothesized that the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR or NR3C1) may be coupled to IL-6 expression in specific cell types that govern cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Examining single cell RNA-seq data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients and nearly 2 million human cells from a pan-tissue scan shows that alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells co-express both NR3C1 and IL-6. The mechanism of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) agonists mitigating pulmonary and multi-organ inflammation in some COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, may be in part due to their successful antagonism of IL-6 production within lung macrophages and vasculature.
9e3bcdb813fb037439d2a85cb02a401441ae3eca	We are being confronted with the most consequential pandemic since the Spanish flu of 1918-1920 to the extent that never before have 4 billion people quarantined simultaneously; to address this global challenge we bring to the forefront the options for medical treatment and summarize SARS-coV2 structure and functions, immune responses and known treatments. Based on literature and our own experience we propose new interventions, including the use of amiodarone, simvastatin, pioglitazone and curcumin. In mild infections (sore throat, cough) we advocate prompt local treatment for the naso-pharynx (inhalations; aerosols; nebulizers); for moderate to severe infections we propose a tried-and-true treatment: the combination of arginine and ascorbate, administered orally or intravenously. The material is organized in three sections: i) Clinical aspects of COVID-19; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARdS); known treatments; ii) Structure and functions of SARS-coV2 and proposed antiviral drugs; iii) The combination of arginine-ascorbate. 1.

c61f672f87f74c18c0fbca82b4d1103eb04bc1dd	The mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) form part of a signaling cascade through phosphorylation reactions conserved in all eukaryotic organisms. The MAPK cascades are mainly composed by three proteins, MAPKKKs, MAPKKs and MAPKs. Some signals induce MAPKKK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of MAPKK that phosphorylate and activate MAPK. Afterward, MAPKs can act either in the cytoplasm or be imported into the nucleus to activate other proteins or transcription factors. In the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the pathway for nitrogen (N) assimilation is well characterized, yet its regulation still has many unknown features. Nitric oxide (NO) is a fundamental signal molecule for N regulation, where nitrate reductase (NR) plays a central role in its synthesis. The MAPK cascades could be regulating N assimilation, since it has been described that the phosphorylation of NR by MAPK6 promotes NO production in Arabidopsis thaliana. We have identified the proteins involved in the MAPK cascades in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, finding 17 MAPKs, 2 MAPKKs and 108 MAPKKKs (11 MEKK-, 94 RAF-and 3 ZIK-type) that have been structurally and phylogenetically characterized. The genetic expressions of MAPKs and the MAPKK were slightly regulated by N. However, the genetic expressions of MAPKKKs RAF14 and RAF79 showed a very strong repression by ammonium, which suggests that they may have a key role in the regulation of N assimilation, encouraging to further analyze in detail the role of MAPK cascades in the regulation of N metabolism.
c082141fdc3333ee7d811796727c92149a1e2f93	Recent global threats (e.g. Ebola, avian influenza, the Zika virus) have demonstrated the need for policy makers to focus on the detection of risks at the animal-human interface. Yet epistemic knowledge across these domains is not sufficiently joinedup. The article argues that, despite some progress, in order for the policy agenda for global health security to develop towards a 'One Health' model there is a need for integration across public and animal health domains. This article sets out an evaluation framework for establishing knowledge integration across these sectors. The article concludes that although 'One Health may seem utopian, given there are key challenges when it comes to reaching integration, there are important steps that can be taken the short to medium-term. These include reforms to education and training programmes and interdisciplinary research collaborations. A key determinant of whether One Health becomes a paradigm which frames public policy, and leads to policy and institutional changes to enable public value creation and sustainability, is the presence of an 'epistemic community' that bridges health networks. • Recognise the need for cross-policy sector collaboration: in order to address the acute vulnerabilities of the spread of disease and pandemics (e.g. influenza, SARS and Ebola) the establishment of a 'One Health' policy model for health security governance, coupled with the development of public health capacities and the breaking down of disciplinary silos, is required. • The need for strategic leadership and networking: there are strategic leadership opportunities for the World Health Organisation (WHO) to shape its organisational identity in order to become one of a network-builder, 'metagovernor' and advocate for One Health in order to shape global health security policy responses.
33172f387afbeeee26c55740e31b359ff998c26a	A cytokine storm induced by SARS-Cov2 may produce pneumonitis which may be fatal for older patients with underlying lung disease. Hyper-elevation of Interleukin1 (IL-1), Tumor necrosis factor-1alfa (TNF-1 alfa), and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) produced by inflammatory macrophage M1 may damage the lung alveoli leading to severe pneumonitis, decreased oxygenation, and potential death despite artificial ventilation. Older patients may not be suitable candidates for pharmaceutical intervention targeting IL -1/6 blockade or artificial ventilation. Low dose total lung (LDTL) irradiation at a single dose of 50 cGy may stop this cytokine cascade, thus preventing, and/or reversing normal organs damage. This therapy has been proven in the past to be effective against pneumonitis of diverse etiology and could be used to prevent death of older infected patients. Thus, LDRT radiotherapy may be a cost-effective treatment for this frail patient population whom radiation -induced malignancy is not a concern because of their advanced age. This hypothesis should be tested in future prospective trials.
9e397eddddc2196c007a4c8dfc7eaa651dfe6ed5	In an avian flu pandemic, which drugs could be used to treat or prevent infection with influenza A (H5N1) virus? Foremost are the viral neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which have already been used to treat human influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B virus infections. The use of the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine is compounded by the rapid development of drug resistance. Although formally approved for other indications (i.e. treatment of hepatitis C), ribavirin and pegylated interferon might also be useful for controlling avian flu. Combined use of the currently available drugs should be taken into account and attempts should be made to develop new strategies directed at unexplored targets such as the viral proteins hemagglutinin, the viral polymerase (and endonuclease) and the non-structural protein NS1. As has been shown for other viral infections, RNA interference could be a powerful means with which to suppress the replication of avian H5N1.
6d02914238a99c539638fa7bed1e5a658c731c1f	Viral zoonoses have represented a significant public health problem throughout history, affecting all continents. Furthermore, many viral zoonoses have emerged or reemerged in recent years, highlighting the importance of such diseases. Emerging viral zoonoses encompass a vast number of different viruses and many different transmission modes. There are many factors influencing the epidemiology of the various zoonoses, such as ecological changes, changes in agriculture and food production, the movement of pathogens, including via travel and trade, human behavior and demographical factors, and microbial changes and adaptation. Costeffective prevention and control of emerging viral zoonoses necessitates an interdisciplinary and holistic approach and international cooperation. Surveillance, laboratory capability, research, training and education, and last but not least, information and communication are key elements.
cbf789657270a691a532fbf24f326b2bbb2775f1	1 Data as of March 29, 2020 show that the "flattening" strategy for COVID-19 in the U.S. is 2 working so well that a clean removal of social distancing (aka "unlock") at any time in 2020 will 3 produce a renewed catastrophe, overloading the healthcare system. Leaving the economy locked down 4 for a long time is its own catastrophe. An SIR-type model with clear parameters suitable for public 5 information, and both tracking and predictive capabilities which "learns" disease spread characteristics 6 rapidly as policy changes, suggests that a solution to the problem is a partial unlock. Case load can be 7 managed so as not to exceed critical resources such as ventilators, yet allow enough people to get sick 8 that herd immunity develops and a full unlock can be achieved in as little as five weeks from beginning 9 of implementation. The partial unlock could be for example 3 full working days per week. Given that 10 not all areas or individuals will respond, and travel and public gatherings are still unlikely, the partial 11 unlock might be 5 full working days per week. The model can be regionalized easily, and by 12 expediting the resolution of the pandemic in the U.S. medical equipment and volunteers, many of them 13 with already acquired immunity, can be made available to other countries. 14
5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	Recent years have witnessed the emergence of novel models for ad-hoc entity search in knowledge graphs of varying complexity. Since these models are based on direct term matching, their accuracy can suffer from a mismatch between vocabularies used in queries and entity descriptions. Although successful applications of word embeddings and knowledge graph entity embeddings to address the issues of vocabulary mismatch in ad-hoc document retrieval and knowledge graph noisiness and incompleteness, respectively, have been reported in recent literature, the utility of joint word and entity embeddings for entity search in knowledge graphs has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose Knowledge graph Entity and Word Embedding for Retrieval (KEWER), a novel method to embed entities and words into the same low-dimensional vector space, which takes into account a knowledge graph's local structure and structural components, such as entities, attributes, and categories, and is designed specifically for entity search. KEWER is based on random walks over the knowledge graph and can be considered as a hybrid of word and network embedding methods. Similar to word embedding methods, KEWER utilizes contextual co-occurrences as training data, however, it treats words and entities as different objects. Similar to network embedding methods, KEWER takes into account knowledge graph's local structure, however, it also differentiates between structural components. Experiments on publicly available entity search benchmarks and state-ofthe-art word and joint word and entity embedding methods indicate that a combination of KEWER and BM25F results in a consistent improvement in retrieval accuracy over BM25F alone.
b5e0c949c62ffb50fd2033020227550b49522cf1	Using a high-throughput DNA sequencing method, one DNA sequence (contig01006), suspected to belong to a novel porcine bocavirus (PBoV), was found with a high rate of detection (19.6 %) in fecal samples from healthy piglets. Moreover, a novel PBoV (tentatively named PBoV3C) with a nearly complete genome sequence (5235 bp) was identified. PBoV3C exhibits typical genome characteristics of bocaviruses and shows the highest genomic sequence identity (78 % to 81 %) to PBoV3A/B (PBoV3/4-UK) and PBoV3D/E (PBoV3/4-HK), respectively. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis indicated high diversity, prevalence and complexity among the PBoVs. The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) site of VP1 and the secondary structure of VP2 of PBoV3C were also analyzed. Additionally, we propose a uniform method of PBoV nomenclature based on the VP1 gene.
f2f1068f8acb5783b2a349e28e34d0c1e851783f	Importance : The All of Us Research Program hypothesizes that accruing one million or more diverse participants engaged in a longitudinal research cohort will advance precision medicine and ultimately improve human health. Launched nationally in 2018, to date All of Us has recruited more than 345,000 participants. All of Us plans to open beta access to researchers in May 2020. Objective : To demonstrate the quality, utility, and diversity of the All of Us Research Program's initial data release and beta launch of the cloud-based analysis platform, the cloud-based Researcher Workbench. Evidence : We analyzed the initial All of Us data release, comprising surveys, physical measurements (PM), and electronic health record (EHR) data, to characterize All of Us participants including self-reported descriptors of diversity. Data depth, density, and quality were evaluated using medication sequencing analyses for depression and type 2 diabetes. Replication of known oncologic associations with smoking exposure ascertained by EHR and survey data and calculation of population-based atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk scores demonstrated the utility of data and platform capability. Findings : The beta launch of the All of Us Researcher Workbench contains data on 224,143 participants. Seventy-seven percent of this cohort were identified as Underrepresented in Biomedical Research (UBR) including over forty-eight percent self-reporting non-White race. Medication usage patterns in common diseases depression and type 2 diabetes replicated prior findings previously reported in the literature and showed differences based on race. Oncologic associations with smoking were replicated and effect sizes compared for EHR and survey 2 .

8be9fb2ea6f60cdc3b913295e1157ba1bafe3a64	Microsomal-type cytochrome P450s are integral membrane proteins bound to the membrane through their N-terminal transmembrane hydrophobic segment, the signal anchor sequence. To elucidate the determinants that enable the P450s to be located in the ER, we constructed cDNAs encoding chimeric proteins in which a secretory form of carboxyesterase, carboxyesterase Sec, was connected to the N-terminus of the full-length or truncated forms of a microsomal-type P450, P45O{M1), and the constructed plasmids were expressed in COS cells. Since carboxyesterase Sec is an iV-glycosylated secretory protein, endo H treatment could be used to determine whether these chimeric proteins were located in the ER or not. Carboxyesterase Sec with the N-terminal 20 amino acids, containing the transmembrane region, of P45O(M1), was located in the ER, as determined from the endo H sensitivity of the expressed protein and immunofluorescence staining of the cells. As the expressed protein exhibited carboxyesterase activity, it was not retained in the ER through the BiP-dependent quality control system recognizing unfolded proteins. Another chimeric protein constrict in which carboxyesterase Sec was connected to the C-terminal region of rat UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT), that contained a double-lysin ER retention motif, was also located in the ER, as determined from the endo H sensitivity and immunofluorescence staining. On the other hand, the sugar moiety of the carboxyesterase Sec connected to the transmembrane segment of UDP-GT, Sec/GTd, was partially resistant to the endo H treatment. From the results of immunofluorescent staining and cell fractionation, it was concluded that the Sec/GTd product was located in the Golgi apparatus. These observations indicated that the N-terminal hydrophobic segment of P45O(M1) is sufficient for the ER membrane retention, whereas the transmembrane segment of UDP-GT is not. To determine whether microsomal P450s are recycled between the ER and Golgi compartments or not, a DNA construct encoding cathepsin D connected to the N-terminus of P45O(M1) was prepared and expressed in COS cells. The fusion protein was phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation was sensitive to alkaline phosphatase. As a control, authentic cathepsin D was subjected to phosphorylation of its oligosaccharide chain that was resistant to the alkaline phosphatase treatment. Since GlcNAc-P-transferase, which forms the alkaline phosphatase-resistant phosphodiester in the sugar chains of lysosome-targeting proteins, is located in the Golgi apparatus, it was concluded that the oligosaccharide chain of the cathepsin D portion of the fusion protein was not phosphorylated, and that the chimeric protein did not go to the Golgi apparatus. These results indicate that P45O(M1) is not recycled from the Golgi compartments to the ER in cells.

708b99d85508fad46c3981cb0c6a5833f1a03074	This article contributes to the assessment of public policies to control the incidence of COVID-19 in several ways. (1) It contains a brief historical and comparative overview of selected pandemics, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) It provides a simple original model which could be used to prioritize the admission of COVID-19 sufferers to hospital (taking into account available hospital capacity) and (3) it specifies a second model to evaluate desired social choices involving the trade-off between the severity of social restrictions (taking into account their impact on the incidence of COVID-19) and the level of economic activity. Bergson-type welfare functions are utilized in the second model. It also critically examines the proposition that the isolation (lockdown) of social groups is a desirable method of limiting the incidence of COVID-19. This leads onto the consideration of the extent to which personal freedom of choice (liberty) ought to be restricted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A brief outline follows illustrating the factors that are likely to hinder economic recovery from COVID-19. Particular attention is paid to the moral and ethical questions raised by policies to control COVID-19. These appear to have received little attention in the relevant economic literature.
1117a46882b9d68b7101e36101b2ea254af599a4	Drug delivery through the skin by transdermal patches has a long history. Subsequent growth of transdermal science proved prominent utility of transdermal systems meant for passive diffusion of the drug. It was followed by the development of iontophoresis-and sonophoresis-based transdermal delivery systems. Microneedle array has now caught attention of the investigators owing to its immense utility in transdermal delivery of very large molecules with ionic and hydrophilic nature. In this technical note, we present the current scenario, applications, and recent advances in microneedle array-based delivery of the most critical molecules through the skin. The application of microneedle has widely been investigated, and these technologies are being developed for the delivery of bio-therapeutics, bio-macromolecules, insulin, growth hormones, immunobiologicals, proteins, siRNA, and peptides. Potential of microneedles to transform the global transdermal market is highlighted in terms of the success rate of the microneedle technologies in clinical trials reaching to the global market. The arrival of the commercial microneedle-based products in the market is highly anticipated as they have potential to portray remarkable impact on clinical medicine in near future.

We analysed an outbreak involving three non-associated families in Restaurant X in Guangzhou, China, and assessed the possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the associated environmental conditions. : medRxiv preprint 2 Methods: We collected epidemiological data, obtained a video record and a patron seatingarrangement from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method. Results: Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequently, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75-1.04 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back-to-back sitting by some patrons. Our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Conclusions: Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of COVID-19.
64add1b3ac7f824ad1c0664f06b6f63aa1a0ffc2	Face shields are personal protective equipment devices that are to be used by many health care workers during COVID 19 pandemic for protection of the facial area and associated mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth) from droplet spread of infection. Face shields are generally not used alone, but in conjunction with other protective equipment like cap, mask, goggle, and are therefore classified as adjunctive personal protective equipment. In the wake of scarcity of face shields during the COVID 19 Pandemic, consideration of innovating newer methods of manufacturing must be considered to overcome the present day scarcity without jeopardising the safety of front line Heath care workers. All initial fast innovations comes with advantages and disadvantages, hence we thought of putting down simple guidelines for new emerged face shield use.

Because virtual care collapses the barriers of time and distance, it is ideal for providing care that is patient-centered, lower cost, more convenient and at greater productivity. All these factors make virtual care tools indispensable elements in the COVID19 response. In this perspective, we offer implementation guidance and policy insights relevant to the use of virtual care tools to meet the challenges of the COVID19 pandemic. npj Digital Medicine (2020) 3:64 ; https://doi.
9d2e17ce6e8bd1f279c8d9596a7d04e47ceb9bc4	Although social presence plays an essential role under general conditions, its role becomes significant for societal protection during the quarantine period in epidemic outbreak. In this study, we attempted to identify the role of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth in terms of their direct impact on online social presence during the outbreak as well as their impacts mediated by epidemic protection and attitudes toward epidemic outbreaks. For this purpose, a unique multi-mediation model is proposed to provide a new direction for research in the field of epidemic outbreaks and their control. Through random sampling, an online survey was conducted and data from 683participants were analyzed. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships between the variables of interest. The study results revealed that the roles of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth are positively related to online social presence during the outbreak. Epidemic protection and attitude toward epidemic outbreak were found to positively moderate the impact of the role of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth on online social presence during the outbreak. The key findings of this study have both practical and academic implications. health protection. This phenomenon encouraged us to formulate a theoretical model based on social presence theory and the role of social media to help examine safety and participation in quarantine. The conceptual model is presented in Figure 1 . Word of mouth can be defined as "the intention to share a certain story using one's own social media account" [2] . Many researchers proved that communication has more of an impact through social media with regards to different health issues, and message sharing was found to be the best predictor of emotive and passionate response [3] . Online health information is regularly updated [4] . Nowadays, universal and worldwide flow cannot be ignored [5] and search engines are the most effective method to find information [6] . The Internet is also a useful source for people in the medical field for discussions and interactions about medical issues [7] . A nine-year big data study showed that the use of computers projected emotive improvement [8] . From the health protection point of view, many factors were found to affect the dispersal of cancer information, including anxiety, courage, anticipation, and sharing of experience [9] . A study proved that the gestation time of infection (corona virus) was assessed at about 2-14 days [7] . So, a research question was raised about protection during an epidemic outbreak. Social media campaigns with complete research frameworks with theoretical and statistical support for these time periods are essentially to protect society during emergencies. To address this need, our research model includes the factors that trigger safety campaigns and the main effects (direct) of direct relations and the association of mediators on online social presence. The literature shows that for different disease management programmers, among health experts, the most important aspects are self-value, the individual's reputation [10] , and sharing their familiarity and information. However, this issue is seldom observed within a framework of online health communities [10] because, with the spread of disease contacts, heterogeneity is critical [11] . Public health moved to a wider political regime from health-dedicated management in 2013 in England as public health functions were relocated to local management from the National Health Service (NHS) [12] . Acceptance of a meningococcal vaccine was unidentified by inspiration of schools [13] . By keeping an individual's record, doctors can assess body mass index (BMI) and threats to health more accurately and precisely. Sharing opinions and views on actual proceedings is easy with the help of the Internet [14] . Paying attention to the sharing of data determines self-assurance [15] . In the case of failure, specifically in Nepal [16], a lack of education was observed in practice in community-based health insurance. The authors found that people mostly hold back from taking preventive and measure son time on reporting as few first reported cases in any disease outbreak. When they can see more danger, they might become more careful. In rural areas, maternal and child health (MCH) systems are progressing because the government has formed different partnerships and associations at different levels [17] .In countries other than China, secrecy and trust were found to be hindrances to the use of social media [18] . Some countries do not allow people to post health information on social media without authentic reports [19] . Online communal support is also affected by online communication of health professionals with patients [20] and the use of online technology for societal help [15] . We cannot ignore that fear, gossip, and rumors are spread online by some medical experts [21] . The above literature shows the role of social media in spreading information, although a small number of rumors may also be spread through society. Loyalty and devotion to one's country is emotive behavior, especially in republic countries [22] . The Chinese nation is one of most patriotic nations in the world. Our study area, Wuhan, is considered the Chicago of China due to its heavy road traffic, and the population of Wuhan is more than 11 million [23] . Anhui province is next to Wuhan, containing the second city reporting patients with COVID-19, after Wuhan. Computers do not have a direct impact on physical health activities but play an intellectual role in online social awareness. The reliability of messages and information along with the trustworthiness of websites are important with regards to health [24] . However, users' views about their health conditions were the same after using an app as before using the app [25] . Compared to men, women post more statements on social media about health problems online and argue more Author Contributions: Conceptualization, A.Y. and X.H.; Data collection, J.S. and S.A.N.; Formal analysis, M.A.; Software, A.R.

2b2ec303d28afd9e460b710dd23efe264a5359f0	Human parechoviruses (HPeVs), a poorly studied genus within the Picornaviridae family, are classified into 19 genotypes of which HPeV1 and HPeV3 are the most often detected. HPeV1 VP1 C terminus contains an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif and has been shown to depend on the host cell surface αV integrins (αV ITGs) and heparan sulfate (HS) for entry. HPeV3 lacks this motif and the receptors remain unknown. HPeVs can be detected in patient nasopharyngeal and stool samples, and infection is presumed to occur after respiratory or gastro-intestinal transmission. HPeV pathogenesis is poorly understood as there are no animal models and previous studies have been conducted in immortalized monolayer cell cultures which do not adequately represent the characteristics of human tissues. To bridge this gap, we determined the polarity of infection, replication kinetics, and cell tropism of HPeV1 and HPeV3 in the well-differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) model. We found the HAE cultures to be permissive for HPeVs. Both HPeV genotypes infected the HAE preferentially from the basolateral surface while the progeny virus was shed toward the apical side. Confocal microscopy revealed the target cell type to be the p63 + basal cells for both viruses, αV ITG and HS blocking had no effect on the replication of either virus, and transcriptional profiling suggested that HPeV3 infection induced stronger immune activation than HPeV1. Genotype-specific host responses may contribute to the differences in pathogenesis and clinical outcomes associated with HPeV1 and HPeV3.
2286b53045dda4309a7f4da297e7d1974b1cb0d4	Acral melanoma is the most common type of melanoma in Asians, and usually results in a poor prognosis due to late diagnosis. We applied a convolutional neural network to dermoscopy images of acral melanoma and benign nevi on the hands and feet and evaluated its usefulness for the early diagnosis of these conditions. A total of 724 dermoscopy images comprising acral melanoma (350 images from 81 patients) and benign nevi (374 images from 194 patients), and confirmed by histopathological examination, were analyzed in this study. To perform the 2-fold cross validation, we split them into two mutually exclusive subsets: half of the total image dataset was selected for training and the rest for testing, and we calculated the accuracy of diagnosis comparing it with the dermatologist's and non-expert's evaluation. The accuracy (percentage of true positive and true negative from all images) of the convolutional neural network was 83.51% and 80.23%, which was higher than the non-expert's evaluation (67.84%, 62.71%) and close to that of the expert (81.08%, 81.64%). Moreover, the convolutional neural network showed area-under-the-curve values like 0.8, 0.84 and Youden's index like 0.6795, 0.6073, which were similar score with the expert. Lee SW, et al.

7b42a6ea412d7cf27b5b1ae0be4eeba7c0676795	The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. It was first observed to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations have been increasingly recognized. Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diarrhea is the most common GI manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 and can present without or without respiratory symptoms. Patients with GI symptoms have been associated with longer duration of illness and may be associated with more severe illness. Mechanism of diarrhea is thought to be related to direct viral cytotoxicity occurring when the SARS-CoV-3 enters GI cells via the ACE-2 receptor. Inflammatory response and cytokine release likely contributes to symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 can cause hepatic injury. Studies have shown mild to moderate elevation of liver enzymes. The pattern of liver abnormalities can be hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed. Patients with severe infection have significantly higher rates of liver injury and worse outcomes. Proposed mechanisms for injury include immune mediated systemic inflammatory response, direct cytotoxicity from viral replication and hypoxia-reperfusion dysfunction. Recent data suggests that GI and hepatic injury may be under-recognized manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with diarrhea and liver disease may have a worse prognosis. The rapidly evolving literature continues to reveal a growing body of information which enables updated guidance for management. More investigation is needed which focuses on vulnerable patients, including the elderly, those with underlying illness, as well as, racial and ethnic minorities.
e307b57912517231f1a8b17a7c6c7f920cd5f5f3	Background As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have adopted measures of social distance, with the childhood population being one of the main focus of attention in these measures. Methods A rapid scoping review was carried out by searching PubMed to know if children are more contagious than adults, and the proportion of asymptomatic cases in children. Google Scholar and MedRxiv/bioRxiv were also searched. The time period was restricted from 1 December 2019 until 28 May 2020. Only studies published in English, Italian, French or Spanish were included. Results Fourteen out of 1099 identified articles were finally included. Studies included cases from China (n=9 to 2143), China and Taiwan (n=536), Korea (n=1), Vietnam (n=1), Australia (n=9), Geneva (n=40), the Netherlands (n=116), Ireland (n=3) and Spain (population-based study of IgG, n=8243). Although no complete data were available, between 15% and 55%-60% were asymptomatic, and 75%-100% of cases were from family transmission. Studies analysing school transmission showed children as not a driver of transmission. Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in children <15 years was lower than the general population in the Spanish study.
d6d7306eb3f303f7461ab6cab965ef0c5d179719	Modern societies are exposed to a myriad of risks ranging from disease to natural hazards and technological disruptions. Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agentbased modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socioenvironmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning. The choice of how to represent social learning in an agent-based model could be driven by existing cultural and social norms prevalent in a modeled society.
2f67fcb74856cb4edfed14efaa271f1a6dfdd2cd	Testing is an important part of tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. Availability of testing is a bottleneck due to constrained resources and effective prioritization of individuals is necessary. Here, we discuss the impact of different prioritization policies on COVID-19 patient discovery and the ability of governments and health organizations to use the results for effective decision making. We suggest a framework for testing that balances maximal discovery of positive individuals with the need for population-based surveillance aimed at understanding disease spread and characteristics. This framework draws from similar approaches to prioritization in the domain of cyber-security based on ranking individuals using a risk score and then reserving a portion of the capacity for random sampling. This approach is an application of Multi-Armed-Bandits maximizing exploration/exploitation of the underlying distribution. We find that individuals can be ranked for effective testing using a few simple features, and that ranking them using such models we can capture 65% (CI: 64.7%-68.3%) of the positive individuals using less than 20% of the testing capacity or 92.1% (CI: 91.1%-93.2%) of positives individuals using 70% of the capacity, allowing reserving a significant portion of the tests for population studies. Our approach allows experts and decision makers to tailor the resulting policies as needed allowing transparency into the ranking policy and the ability to understand the disease spread in the population and react quickly and in an informed manner.

8619613050da13f44758552a0e44fb85e201baeb	The latest version of human coronavirus said to be COVID-19 came out as a sudden pandemic disease within human population and in the absence of vaccination and proper treatment till date, it daunting threats heavily to human lives, infecting more than 12, 11, 214 people and death more than 67, 666 people in 208 countries across the globe as on April 06, 2020, which is highly alarming. When no treatment or vaccine is available till date and to avoid COVID-19 to be transmitted in the community, social distancing is the only way to prevent the disease, which is well taken into account in our novel epidemic models as a special compartment, that is, home isolation. Based on the transmitting behaviour of COVID-19 in the human population, we develop three quarantine models of this pandemic taking into account the compartments: susceptible population, immigrant population, home isolation population, infectious population, hospital quarantine population, and recovered population. Local and global asymptotic stability is proved for all the three models. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to establish the analytical results with suitable examples. Our research reveals that home isolation and quarantine to hospitals are the two pivot forcecontrol policies under the present situation when no treatment is available for this pandemic.

8466f11ac556bca1bac29ec93d802b49e020122f	Bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis is caused by Clostridium perfringens and leads to sudden death. Alpha toxin, together with perfringolysin O, has been identified as the principal toxin involved in the pathogenesis. We assessed the potential of alpha toxin as a vaccine antigen. Using an intestinal loop model in calves, we investigated the protection afforded by antisera raised against native alpha toxin or its non-toxic C-terminal fragment against C. perfringensinduced intestinal necrosis. Immunization of calves with either of the vaccine preparations induced a strong antibody response. The resulting antisera were able to neutralize the alpha toxin activity and the C. perfringens-induced endothelial cytotoxicity in vitro. The antisera raised against the native toxin had a stronger neutralizing activity than those against the C-terminal fragment. However, antibodies against alpha toxin alone were not sufficient to completely neutralize the C. perfringens-induced necrosis in the intestinal loop model. The development of a multivalent vaccine combining the C-terminal fragment of alpha toxin with other C. perfringens virulence factors might be necessary for complete protection against bovine necrohemorrhagic enteritis.

The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes, 55 followed by cardiovascular diseases and respiratory system diseases (2%). Overall, given that the 56 prevalence of asthma in China is 4.2%, these early studies showed that asthma is not a risk factor 57 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, Richardson et al. evaluated characteristics, 58 comorbidities, and outcomes among 5.700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York 59 City area and find no increase in hospitalizations among asthmatic patients; indeed, the reported 60 percentage (9%) is in line with the annual American one (6). 61 Beyond China and U.S.A. , looking at the recent data from Italy, among 355 patients who died 62 because of SARS-CoV-2, asthma was not listed as a relevant comorbidity (7). Our data appear 63 even more significant if we consider that the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy coincided with 64 the advent of the new rilevant pollen season and therefore with the annual periodic increase in cases 65 of seasonal allergic asthma. An intriguing hypothesis is that having asthma protects against SARS-66
1e28555eb17a5df65b5e049feb3de70c8cb232db	The number and size of existing research studies with massive databases and biosample repositories that could be leveraged for public health response against SARS-CoV-2 (or other infectious disease pathogens) are unparalleled in history. What risks are posed by coopting research infrastructure-not just data and samples but also participant recruitment and contact networks, communications, and coordination functionsfor public health activities? The case of the Seattle Flu Study highlights the general challenges associated with utilizing research infrastructure for public health response, including the legal and ethical considerations for research data use, the return of the results of public health activities relying upon research resources to unwitting research participants, and the possible impacts of public health reporting mandates on future research participation. While research, including public health research, is essential during a pandemic, careful consideration should be given to distinguishing and balancing the ethical mandates of public health activities against the existing ethical responsibilities of biomedical researchers.

ABSTRACT Garcia-Sanchez, J., Corral, C., Halaihel, N.G., Simon, M.C., Alonso, J.L., Muzquiz, J.L., Ortega, C. and Girones, O., 1993. Survey of rotavirus infection in a dairy herd: comparison between polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two commercial tests. Vet. Microbiol., 34:321-332. A survey of rotavirus infection in a dairy herd with a history of neonatal diarrhoea was carried out. Faecal samples taken from 15 cows before and after calving as well as faeces taken from their calves daily from birth to two weeks of life were tested for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and compared with an ELISA and a latex agglutination commercial test. Rotavirus excretion was not detected in faeces from cows around parturition by any of the three tests. However, all of their calves shed rotaviruses during the observation period. The onset of rotavirus excretion determined by PAGE ranged from day 2 to day 8 of life (day 4.8 + 1.8 on average) and lasted for 4 to 7 days (5.3 + 1.1 days on average). Chi-square test showed a significant association (P= 0.0001 ) between the presence of rotavirus and the altered consistency of calves faeces. All the three tests showed similar results (overall agreement 92.5%) but discrepancies were detected mainly at the beginning or at the end of the rotavirus excretion period. Results obtained with both commercial kits closely paralleled each other and parameters other than sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy or predictive values have to be considered as selection criteria.
8f9dbeeadab370c7dbc889fe2b67aaaf15c8289c	Influenza A and B viruses are highly contagious respiratory pathogens with a considerable medical and socioeconomical burden and known pandemic potential. Current influenza vaccines require annual updating and provide only partial protection in some risk groups. Due to the global spread of viruses with resistance to the M2 proton channel inhibitor amantadine or the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, novel antiviral agents with an original mode of action are urgently needed. We here focus on emerging options to interfere with the influenza virus entry process, which consists of the following steps: attachment of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated host cell receptors, endocytosis, M2-mediated uncoating, low pH-induced membrane fusion, and, finally, import of the viral ribonucleoprotein into the nucleus. We review the current functional and structural insights in the viral and cellular components of this entry process, and the diverse antiviral strategies that are being explored. This encompasses small molecule inhibitors as well as macromolecules such as therapeutic antibodies. There is optimism that at least some of these innovative concepts to block influenza virus entry will proceed from the proof of concept to a more advanced stage. Special attention is therefore given to the challenging issues of influenza virus (sub)type-dependent activity or potential drug resistance. C
ba7a472f2255db20511d7bbc35ab6da48438d913	The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments worldwide to impose movement restrictions on their citizens. Although critical to reducing the virus' reproduction rate, these restrictions come with far-reaching social and economic consequences. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these restrictions on an individual level among software engineers currently working from home. Although software professionals are accustomed to working with digital tools, but not all of them remotely, in their day-to-day work, the abrupt and enforced work-from-home context has resulted in an unprecedented scenario for the software engineering community. In a two-wave longitudinal study (N = 192), we covered over 50 psychological, social, situational, and physiological factors that have previously been associated with well-being or productivity. Examples include anxiety, distractions, psychological and physical needs, office set-up, stress, and work motivation. This design allowed us to identify those variables that explain unique variance in well-being and productivity. Results include (1) the quality of social contacts predicted positively, and stress predicted an individual's well-being negatively when controlling for other variables consistently across both waves; (2) boredom and distractions predicted productivity negatively; (3) productivity was less strongly associated These authors contributed equally. 2 Daniel Russo et al. with all predictor variables at time two compared to time one, suggesting that software engineers adapted to the lockdown situation over time; and (4) the longitudinal study did not provide evidence that any predictor variable causal explained variance in well-being and productivity. Our study can assess the effectiveness of current work-from-home and general well-being and productivity support guidelines and provide tailored insights for software professionals.

a93c74bb95bce91a99f39cb01bbe5b5935f4bbd7	Respiratory viruses that emerge in the human population may cause high morbidity and mortality, as well as concern about pandemic spread. Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on nonhuman primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza. Secondly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared. Host species, host age, route of inoculation, location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease. The design of appropriate animal models requires an accurate pathological description of human cases, as well as a good understanding of the effect of experimental variables on disease outcome.

Perspectives on the epizootiology of feline enteric coronavirus and the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis. Vet. Microbiol., 28: 243-255. This review presents some current thoughts regarding the epizootiology of the feline coronaviruses; feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline coronavirus (FECV), with primary emphasis on the pathogenesis of these viruses in nature. Although the mechanism (s) whereby FIPV causes disease are still incompletely understood, there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated. Two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of FIPV and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research. The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 1981, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract. The second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance, which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systemic immunity. In the case of FIPV infection, we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level. Once oral tolerance is disrupted, FIPV is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death. Thus, it may be that clinical forms of FIP are due to a combination of two events, the first being the generation of FIPV from FECV, and the second being the capacity of FIPV to circumvent oral tolerance.
341443629266463e0b2c7a3ee45efca316829910	The COVID-19 pandemic has provided many challenges in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis. Among these is a novel form of coagulopathy that includes exceptionally high levels of D-dimer. D-dimer is a marker of poor prognosis, but does this also imply a causal relationship? These spectacularly raised Ddimer levels may actually signify the failing attempt of the fibrinolytic system to remove fibrin and necrotic tissue from the lung parenchyma, being consumed or overwhelmed in the process. Indeed, recent studies suggest that increasing fibrinolytic activity might offer hope for patients with critical disease and severe respiratory failure. However, the fibrinolytic system can also be harnessed by coronavirus to promote infectivity and where anti-fibrinolytic measures would also seem appropriate. Hence, there is a clinical paradox where plasmin formation can be either deleterious or beneficial in COVID-19, but not at the same time. Hence, it all comes down to timing.
13bbcb3c3918bb18aa45ebbca634a0db93d4c1e0	The key precursors for p-hydroxybenzoate production by engineered Pseudomonas putida S12 are phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), for which the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway is an important source. Since PP pathway fluxes are typically low in pseudomonads, E4P and PEP availability is a likely bottleneck for aromatics production which may be alleviated by stimulating PP pathway fluxes via co-feeding of pentoses in addition to glucose or glycerol. As P. putida S12 lacks the natural ability to utilize xylose, the xylose isomerase pathway from E. coli was introduced into the p-hydroxybenzoate producing strain P. putida S12palB2. The initially inefficient xylose utilization was improved by evolutionary selection after which the p-hydroxybenzoate production was evaluated. Even without xylose-co-feeding, p-hydroxybenzoate production was improved in the evolved xyloseutilizing strain, which may indicate an intrinsically elevated PP pathway activity. Xylose co-feeding further improved the p-hydroxybenzoate yield when co-fed with either glucose or glycerol, up to 16.3 Cmol% (0.1 g p-hydroxybenzoate/g substrate). The yield improvements were most pronounced with glycerol, which probably related to the availability of the PEP precursor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). Thus, it was demonstrated that the production of aromatics such as p-hydroxybenzoate can be improved by co-feeding different carbon sources via different and partially artificial pathways. Moreover, this approach opens new perspectives for the efficient production of (fine) chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulose that typically has a high content of both glucose and xylose and (crude) glycerol. Keywords Pseudomonas putida S12 . Aromatics . Mixed substrate feeding . Glucose . Xylose Jean-Paul Meijnen and Suzanne Verhoef contributed equally to this work.
cc0b240ce6015c9bc86ef54a44416c52f5ab27a6	In this study, it was aimed to investigate the efficacy of chitosan oligosaccharide administrations in different doses of experimental infected lambs with Cryptosporidium parvum. 32 male lambs were used in the study and the lambs were divided into 4 groups with 8 lambs in each group. Groups 1, 2 and 3, twice a day, were administered chitosan oligosaccharide at a dose of 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg for 7 days, respectively, with milk replacer. In group 4, lambs with cryptosporidiosis were subjected to normal feeding as control without drug administration. Clinical examinations of lambs were made before treatment (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after treatment and 5 ml of blood was collected from vena jugularis for blood analysis of all lambs. Weight changes of lambs were recorded at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days. Stool specimens were collected pre-treatment (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment to determine oocyst excretion of lambs with cryptosporidiosis. Lambs with a mean oocyte counts > 10 after stool examination were included to the treatment. Changes in clinical hematology, blood gases and biochemical parameters were observed during the course of treatment, but these changes were limited. Weight loss was observed at 7th day according to 0th day the lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis but gradually weight increase was observed at 14th and 21st days and these changes were similar in all groups. Oocyst excretion decreased in all groups during treatment. According to 0th day, there was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in oocyte excretions in the third day in group 1 and 2, and in day 5 in the group 3 and 4. Significant changes (p < 0.05) were observed in oocyst excretions on the third and fifth days among the groups. As a result, in lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis, chitosan oligosaccharide improved in clinical signs and stool character shorter than the positive control group and the administration of chitosan oligosaccharide at doses of 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 7 days significantly reduced oocyst excretion but not enough to remove cryptosporidiosis completely.
e690c113c207f132b7b68a38f53889109e65a166	To gain entry into the target cell, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) uses its spike (S) protein S2 subunit to fuse with the plasma or endosomal membrane. Previous work identified a peptide derived from the heptad repeat (HR) 2 domain in S2 subunit, HR2P, which potently blocked MERS-CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion. Here, we tested an HR2P analogue with improved pharmaceutical property, HR2P-M2, for its inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo. HR2P-M2 was highly effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with or without mutation in the HR1 region. It interacted with the HR1 peptide to form stable α-helical complex and blocked six-helix bundle formation between the HR1 and HR2 domains in the viral S protein. Intranasally administered HR2P-M2 effectively protected adenovirus serotype-5-human dipeptidyl peptidase 4-transduced mice from infection by MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in the HR1 region of S protein, with >1000-fold reduction of viral titers in lung, and the protection was enhanced by combining HR2P-M2 with interferon β. These results indicate that this combination regimen merits further development to prevent MERS in high-risk populations, including healthcare workers and patient family members, and to treat MERS-CoV-infected patients.

It is a simple paradigm that can be reliably controlled, which makes it well-suited for testing the sensory perspectives of a highly understudied, nocturnal mammal. The pangolin is unique in that it is one of the world's most endangered and widely trafficked animals 16-21 , yet we know little about its behaviour or ecology 17, 22, [24] [25] [26] . The limited scientific data on pangolins are concerning considering that all eight species are threatened with extinction 16 . The primary threats to conserving wild pangolins are unsustainable levels of poaching for traditional medicine and bushmeat, and habitat loss [25] [26] [27] [28] . Much of the literature on pangolins details the degree to which the illegal wildlife trade continues to drastically affect their population numbers 17-21 , with limited investigation thus far of how pangolins behave in their natural environments 17, 22, [24] [25] [26] 29 . Conservation concern for pangolins is further complicated by the difficulty of studying them in the wild 17,25,29-31 , as their reduced numbers provide fewer sampling opportunities and our lack of understanding regarding their ecology impairs our ability to locate those that remain. Opportunities to study and conserve pangolins ex-situ are also rare, given that there is a particularly high mortality rate associated with maintaining them in captivity 17,31-37 . Pangolins often die in captivity as a result of improper diets 17, 35, 38, 40 and the difficulty of rehabilitating them after they have been exposed to the physical traumas of illegal poaching and smuggling 32,39-42 . Given the challenges of studying pangolins both in captivity and the wild, any opportunity to study their behaviour could have a significant, positive impact on both captive welfare and wild conservation efforts. Pangolins are unique mammals with dorsal scaling, no teeth, prehensile tails, and a long tongue that protrudes during foraging 24, 43, 44 . Although there are eight species with distinct characteristics within the pangolin taxon, most are primarily nocturnal 24,44 , and prey on ants and termites 22, 23, 38, 44 . Research on pangolin sensory perception is remarkably lacking. Studies on the brain anatomy of African tree pangolins (Phataginus tricuspis, formerly Manis tricuspis) suggest they have enlarged olfactory bulbs relative to other mammals, but non-remarkable visual and auditory systems 28,45-47 . Behavioural anecdotes of pangolins using their elongated snouts and tongues to forage seem to support the idea that they rely on olfaction and somatosensory information to find food 24, 36, 45, 46, 48 . Although pangolin vision is considered relatively poor 24,36,49 , recent research on the anatomy of the pangolin eye suggests it may be well-adapted for the nocturnal environment 50 . Research on pangolin audition is particularly sparse, with mixed reports on the quality of their hearing 24,36 , and no direct evidence of how they might integrate acoustic information into their general behavioural ecology 47 . The current study specifically investigates the foraging behaviour of the semi-arboreal Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) 24,26,33 , one of the most threatened mammals on the planet 51 . Here, we use several experimental paradigms to investigate the pangolin's use of vision, hearing, and smell to locate food. In Phase I of this study, we tested the pangolin's ability to locate food in a two object-choice task by controlling for two of these three sensory modalities and allowing the animal to investigate and choose, using the remaining sensory information, which one of two containers held food. In other words, we blocked two types of sensory information coming from the food source and thus from being perceived by the pangolin in order to assess whether it was able to use the remaining information alone to find the food. In Phase II, we developed two novel olfaction tasks to investigate whether or not the pangolin was using distant or proximal prey odors to find food. Although there is little known about how pangolins locate food in their environments, our own observations of the pangolin's use of its pronounced snout led us to predict that olfaction would be their dominant sensory modality when foraging.

b7ce3b625fefee03c2f2d5d7728b4b6ab0abbfd1	Designing side chain substituents complementary to enzyme binding pockets is of great importance in the construction of potent and selective phosphinic dipeptide inhibitors of metallo-aminopeptidases. Proper structure selection makes inhibitor construction more economic, as the development process typically consists of multiple iterative preparation/bioassay steps. On the basis of these principles, using noncomplex computation and modeling methodologies, we comprehensively screened 900 commercial precursors of the P1 residues of phosphinic dipeptide and dehydrodipeptide analogs to identify the most promising ligands of 52 metallo-dependent aminopeptidases with known crystal structures. The results revealed several nonproteinogenic residues with an improved energy of binding compared with the best known inhibitors. The data are discussed taking into account the selectivity and stereochemical implications of the enzymes. Using this approach, we were able to identify nontrivial structural elements substituting the recognized phosphinic peptidomimetic scaffold of metallo-aminopeptidase inhibitors.
5f14950df2d6d428b1dff4d58e7775f92da020d7	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in Europe and its prognosis is largely dependent on stage at diagnosis. Currently, there are no suitable tumour markers for early detection of CRC. In a retrospective study we previously found discriminative CRC serum protein profi les with surface enhanced laser desorption ionisation-time of fl ight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). We now aimed at prospective validation of these profi les. Additionally, we assessed their applicability for follow-up after surgery and investigated tissue protein profi les of patients with CRC and adenomatous polyps (AP). Serum and tissue samples were collected from patients without known malignancy with an indication for colonoscopy and patients with AP and CRC during colonoscopy. Serum samples of controls (CON; n = 359), patients with AP (n = 177) and CRC (n = 73), as well as tissue samples from AP (n = 52) and CRC (n = 47) were analysed as described previously. Peak intensities were compared by non-parametric testing. Discriminative power of differentially expressed proteins was assessed with support vector machines (SVM). We confi rmed the decreased serum levels of apolipoprotein C-1 in CRC in the current population. No differences were observed between CON and AP. Apolipoprotein C-I levels did not change signifi cantly within 1 month post-surgery, although a gradual return to normal levels was observed. Several proteins differed between AP and CRC tissue, among which a peak with similar mass as apolipoprotein C-1. This peak was increased in CRC compared to AP. Although we prospectively validated the serum decrease of apolipoprotein C-1 in CRC, serum protein profi les did not yield SVM classifi ers with suitable sensitivity and specifi city for classifi cation of our patient groups.

We present the X-ray crystal structure of PLpro in complex with ubiquitin-aldehyde and model the interaction of PLpro with other ubiquitin-chain and ISG15 substrates. We show that PLpro greatly prefers K48-to K63-linked ubiquitin chains, and ISG15-based substrates to those that are mono-ubiquitinated. We propose that PLpro's higher affinity for K48-linked ubiquitin chains and ISG15 stems from a bivalent mechanism of binding, where two ubiquitin-like domains prefer to bind in the palm domain of PLpro with the most distal ubiquitin domain interacting with a ''ridge'' region of the thumb domain. Mutagenesis of residues within this ridge region revealed that these mutants retain viral protease activity and the ability to catalyze hydrolysis of mono-ubiquitin. However, a select number of these mutants have a significantly reduced ability to hydrolyze the substrate ISG15-AMC, or be inhibited by K48linked diubuiquitin. For these latter residues, we found that PLpro antagonism of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B-cells (NFkB) signaling pathway is abrogated. This identification of key and unique sites in PLpro required for recognition and processing of diubiquitin and ISG15 versus mono-ubiquitin and protease activity provides new insight into ubiquitin-chain and ISG15 recognition and highlights a role for PLpro DUB and deISGylase activity in antagonism of the innate immune response.

1de0921aa7e5225250ff9f569b770c52ae1cb593	From 28 young children in the Netherlands, we isolated a paramyxovirus that was identified as a tentative new member of the Metapneumovirus genus based on virological data, sequence homology and gene constellation. Previously, avian pneumovirus was the sole member of this recently assigned genus, hence the provisional name for the newly discovered virus: human metapneumovirus. The clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus infection, ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Serological studies showed that by the age of five years, virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years.
ff73fb221b2419cd7840328389d5937430e1d481	Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation -Comorbitdity Index (HCT-CI), is a score validated by Sorror et al. to evaluate transplant Transplant-Related Mortality (TRM) incidence, in patients undergoing Allogeneic Transplant. The aim of our study was to assess TRM and the reliability of this score in AML elderly patients undergoing Autologous Transplant. We have treated 101 elderly AML patients aged over 60 years, diagnosed between june 1999 and September 2009. All patients received an induction and consolidation treatment including HD-ARA-C and Idarubicin, with a 30% reduction dose in over 70 years patients; those obtaining a successful mobilization (CD34 + cell > 3 × 10 6 /kg) underwent Autologous Transplant, 12 after Busulfan plus Melfalan (BUMEL) and 9 after BEAM conditioning. The remaining patients received alternative consolidation treatment. We obtained a 71% CR, 49 patients were in CCR and eligible to a second consolidation; 21 of these (43%) obtained a successful CD34 mobilization and underwent Autologous Transplant. Six patients had a HCT-CI 0 score, 11 had a score between 1 and 2, 4 patients had a > 3 score. One of the latter patients had a previous cancer, 2 had an heart valve disease and 1 had diabetes, peptic ulcer requiring treatments and previous severe infectious complications. Five out 21 patients died of transplant, with a 25% cumulative 1-year TRM incidence. Surprisingly no patients with a > 3 HCT-CI score died, vs. one patient in the 1-2 score group (9%) and 4 patients in the 0 score group (67%) (P = 0.02). Age < and > 70 years did not affect the TRM rate, but all the fi ve deaths occurred after the administration of Busulfan plus Melfalan (BUMEL) with an higher TRM rate in this group (42%, P = 0.04) in comparison with the patients receiving BEAM. In our small series all 6 patients with a 0 HCT-CI score received BUMEL as conditioning (P = 0.01), suggesting that the higher TRM rate in this group might be related to the administration of a more toxic conditioning regimen. Elderly patients generally have several comorbidities and HCT-CI score might be an insuffi cient tool in assessing their frailty. The high TRM rate in elderly AML patients suggests that some of these patients should receive less toxic conditioning or alternative consolidation regimen. Larger retrospective and multicentric studies are therefore needed in order to better validate this score in this setting. Prospective validation of novel myeloablative conditioning regimen:Fludarabine-IV Busulfan in 38 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia In conclusion, HCT from MUD or MMUD in AML may result in a similar outcome compared to MRD. A graft from MUD and limited cGVHD may improve survival due to an enhanced graft-versus-leukemia-effect particularly in patients in PR. The HCT specifi c comorbidity index fails to predict survival in a large cohort of predominantly high-risk AML patients -single-centre experience N. Birninger, M. Bornhäuser, S. Parmentier, M. Wermke, M. Schaich, U. Platzbecker, C. Röllig, G. Ehninger, J. Schetelig University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (Dresden, DE) Introduction: The hematopoietic cell transplantation specifi c comorbidity index (HCT-CI) has been proposed to predict nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) in allogeneic HCT recipients. We performed a retrospective study at our center to investigate its capacity in predicting the outcome in comparison with well defi ned disease-specifi c risk factors. Methods: We reviewed the records of 340 patients with AML who underwent allogeneic HCT at our institution between January 2000 and December 2008. Pretransplant comorbidities were assessed by review of medical charts and computer database system. For each patient we assessed the Karnofsky performance score and calculated the HCT-CI as defi ned by Sorror et al. (2005). Cox regression modeling was applied for the endpoint overall survival (OS). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was analysed using univariate and multivariate competing events statistics. Results: The median age at HCT was 53 years (range, 11 to 76). 133 patients had received myeloablative and 207 nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. Donors were matched siblings in 116 and alternative donors in 224 patients. Twenty-fi ve percent patients were in fi rst complete remission of standard risk AML. HCT-CI risk was low in 6%, intermediate in 20%, and high in 74% of the patients. Overall survival at 3 years was 29%, 40%, and 44% (P = 0.7) and NRM was 34%, 32%, and 26% (P = 0.6), in the low, intermediate and high-risk HCT-CI groups, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the HCT-CI failed to predict OS and NRM. A reason for this could be, that patients with low comorbidity scores were very rare in this cohort. In part this was due to the high incidence of "heart valve disease" in our cohort, defi ned in the HCT-CI as any kind of valvular disease except for mitral valve prolapse. Heart valve disease qualifi es on its own for a high HCT-CI score. In the original publication by Sorror the incidence was 2%. Prior to HCT 45% of our patients had mostly trace to mild valvular regurgitation, and thus had a high HCT-CI score. This compares to an incidence of 35% valvular regurgitation in the healthy population (Framingham Heart Study) and may therefore not be overestimated. Ambiguous defi nitions could therefore limit the applicability of the HCT-CI. Conclusion: In conclusion, in high risk AML patients the HCT-CI was not associated with NRM or OS in a cohort of predominantly high risk AML patients. Refi ned defi nitions might improve the performance of the index. We analysed the toxicity and effi cacy of prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions (pDLIs) in 35 patients (median age 56 years, range 20-70) with high risk myeloid malignancies S82 risk-score was calculated as described by Gratwohl et al. (Lancet 352, 1998). Results: Of the 225 pts., 30 (13%) had an EBMT risk-score of 0-1, 48 (21%) had a score of 2, 49 (22%) had a score of 3, 38 (17%) had a score of 4, 47 (21%) had a score of 5, and 14 (6%) had a score of 6-7. At ten years after alloSCT, OS in the different groups were 68% (score of 0-1), 52% (score of 2), 48% (score of 3), 36% (score of 4), 26% (score of 5), or 28% (score of 6-7) and differed significantly (P = 0.002). Likewise, there was a statistically significant difference in relapse between the score groups ranging from 23% (score of 0-1) to 51% (score of 4) (P = 0.028). In contrast, the EBMT risk score did not predict the NRM in the different subgroups (P = 0.084). However, a significant trend towards a lower NRM in pts. with a low score was noticed (logrank test for trend: P = 0.004). Of note, the EBMT risk-score failed to predict OS, relapse, or NRM in pts. conditioned with RIC (n = 100) whereas it did so in the MAC group. Conclusions: These data indicate that the EBMT risk-score may be used to predict the outcome of pts. with AML following MAC-alloSCT. In pts. conditioned with RIC, the EBMT risk-score did not predict the outcome in our patient cohort. P400 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for isolated granulocytic sarcoma (GS): a comparison of outcomes with leukaemic GS on behalf of the ALWP of EBMT P. Chevallier, M. Labopin, J.J. Cornelissen, G. Socie, Clofarabine(Clo) is a nucleoside analog (NA) with much improved antileukemic effi cacy. In vitro, in a human busulfan-(Bu)-resistant AML-cell line, KBM-3/Bu, we found synergy of [Clo + fl udarabine] (Flu) compared with either drug alone. Further, [Clo/Flu + Bu] was superior to [Clo + Bu] or [Flu + Bu]. We now investigated [Clo ± Flu] with IV Bu as pretransplant conditioning in patients with advanced myeloid leukemia and MDS. Methods: Patients were adaptively randomized based on day + 30 disease-and chimerism status: Arm I: Clo:Flu 10:30 mg/m², Arm II 20:20 mg/m², Arm III 30:10 mg/m², and Arm IV: Clo only at 40 mg/m². The Clo and Flu were infused over 1 hr each once daily for 4 days, on each day Bu was given over 3 hr to AUC 6,000 μMol min. GVHD-prophylaxis was tacrolimus + mini MTX. Recipients of unrelated or one Ag-mism. related donor cells received rabbit-ATG. Results: 24 patients were male, 17 female, median age 45 yrs (range 6-59). 32 had AML (ind. failure: 12, chemo-refr. relapse: 9, untr. relapse: 3, CR2 + CR2p: 6, high-risk CR1 + CR1p: 2 [cytog. -7 and t(3;12)]). 17 of the 32 had intermediate, 15 poor prognosis cytogenetics. 9 had CML (BC: 2, second AP: 3, and late CP 4). 19/41 (46%) had related donors (BM:6, PBPC: 13), and 22 (54%) unrelated (BM:11, PBPC:11). All patients engrafted. Day + 30 T-cell chimerism showed Arms I + II (lower Clo doses) with 85% (range 17-100) donor-derived DNA, while Arms III + IV (higher Clo doses) had 100% (64 100) donor-DNA; by day + 100 all groups had a median of 100% donor-DNA. The adaptive randomization allocated most patients to Arm III, (Clo 30 mg/m 2 , Flu 10 mg/m 2 ), in keeping with in vitro synergy of [Clo + Flu]. 83% (20/24) of patients with active AML and 7 of 9 with CML achieved CR post transplant. Median follow-up is 18 mos (range 6-34), and as of Dec. 11, 2009, one-year OS and EFS are 52% and 41%. There were only 2 treatment-related deaths by day + 100 (5%), one pneumonia, one GVHD. Grade 2-3 mucositis was seen in half the patients, but there was no serious hepatic, renal or neuro-toxicity. We conclude: 1) Clofarabine is immunosuppressive enough for pretransplant therapy, 2) [Clo ± Flu] + IV Bu is safe and effi cacious conditioning in myeloid leukemia, 3) In vitro synergy of [Clo + Flu] with IV Bu correlated clinically with the adaptive randomization, favoring Arm III (Clo 30 mg/m² and Flu 10 mg/m²). Additional patients and longer follow-up are needed to evaluate combined nucleoside analogs [Clo + Flu] in pretransplant conditioning. S87 This study compared the results of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from unrelated and related donors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and involved 136 consecutive patients from 10 centers between April 2003 and Dec 2008. Among these patients, 98 received transplantation from matched-related donors (MRD) and 38 matched-unrelated donors (MUD). Twentyeight (28.6%) in the MRD and 14 (36.8%) patients in the MUD were high risk diseases (P = 0.349). In vivo-T cell depletion (TCD) (52.7% vs. 6.1%) and tacrolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (44.7% vs. 4.1%) were more commonly used in the MUD than MRD (P < 0.001). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate (66.0% vs. 62.1%; P = 0.323), the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (27.4% vs. 13.6%; P = 0.111) and non-relapse mortality (16.6% vs. 21.6%, P = 0.992) were not different between MRD and MUD group. The incidence of cytomegalovirus reactivation was higher in the MUD (49.8%) than MRD (22.8%; P = 0.005). The 3-year cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD was 21.2% vs. 27.8% (P = 0.718) and 13.5% vs. 25.6% (P = 0.040) in MRD and MUD group, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, MUD [hazard ratio (HR) 5.297, 95% confi dence interval (CI) 1.156-24.277; P = 0.032], reduced intensity conditioning (HR 7.318,; P = 0.021), and infused CD34 + stem cells > 6 × 10 6 /kg (HR 3.906, 95% CI 1.108-13.711; P = 0.031) were identifi ed as risk factors for the development of extensive chronic GVHD in the multivariate analysis. To adjust the white blood cell (WBC) counts on the differentiating capacity of the leukemic clone, WBC index (WBC X marrow blasts%/100) was calculated, and distinguished 3 groups of patients with different outcomes (low, < 1.0; intermediate, 1.0-6.3; high, 6.3 or more). High index showed poor survival compared to the low index (P = 0.038). In conclusion, transplantation outcome was comparable between unrelated and related donors in terms of OS and incidence of relapse in AML. A decision analysis of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in fi rst remission S. Objectives: The prognosis of refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains dismal. Salvage therapy including gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) can induce remission, but allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the only curative option for this cohort of patients. However, factors predicting the response to GO treatment, especially for patients with complex karyotype, have not yet been defi ned. Here, we present the correlation between response to GO therapy and the presence or absence of HLA-DR15 antigen in a cohort of refractory or relapsed AML patients treated at Hannover Medical School prior to allo-SCT. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients with refractory or relapsed AML treated with GO prior to allo-SCT at our center from 2002 until 2009. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who responded to GO (R group; CR, PR, aplasia) and patients who remained refractory (NR group). Results: 26 patients were evaluable for GO response, and 24 patients have proceeded to allo-SCT so far. Both groups were comparable for sex, age, indication for GO (induction failure vs. relapse), patients with de novo AML vs. sAML/ t-AML and high-risk cytogenetics. Indications for GO included induction failure (n = 14, 54%) and relapse (n = 12, 46%). Thirteen patients (50%) responded to GO treatment. Nine (69%) of these were HLA-DR15 positive compared to 1 (8%) in the NR group (P < 0.01). Remarkably, the cumulative dose of GO was higher in the NR group (8 mg/m 2 ) compared to the R group (5 mg/m 2 ). More patients in the R group received a combination of chemotherapy with GO than in the NR group (54% vs. 15%, P = 0.1). Also, patients in the NR group had a median of 2 prior salvage therapies vs. one median salvage course in the R group. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a major complication in patients receiving GO: 6 of the 24 patients (25%) of the transplant cohort developed SOS, 3 in each group. Three out of these 6 patients had a myeloablative conditioning regimen with busulfan. The remaining SCT patients received different reduced intensity conditioning regimens (67% FLAMSA/TBI) without busulfan. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the fi rst report of an association of GO treatment and HLA-DR 15 antigen positivity. If these results were confi rmed in larger studies, HLA-DR 15 could become a marker for GO response. Such information is of special interest for developing salvage therapies for highrisk patients.

45fbf18ee16592ac7aea4f4b7bca4ad682e5d818	A number of viruses can initiate central nervous system (CNS) diseases that include demyelination as a major feature of neuropathology. In humans, the most prominent demyelinating diseases are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by JC papovirus destruction of oligodendrocytes, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, an invariably fatal childhood disease caused by persistent measles virus. The most common neurological disease of young adults in the developed world, multiple sclerosis, is also characterized by lesions of inflammatory demyelination; however, the etiology of this disease remains an enigma. A viral etiology is possible, because most demyelinating diseases of known etiology in both man and animals are viral. In most cases demyelination is to a limited extent the result of direct virus destruction of oligodendrocytes, but for the most part is the consequence of immune and inflammatory responses. These models illustrate the roles of age and genetic susceptibility and establish the concept that persistent CNS infection can lead to the generation of CNS autoimmune responses.

cb6e922636d0d3d414a7ab7b2b6d53146a0ec7d9	Despite the availability of effective chemotherapy, the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and of TB-related critical illness has increased dramatically over the last few decades [1, 2] . Moreover, mortality rates remain high in patients with active severe pulmonary TB requiring mechanical ventilation [3] . Delays in diagnosis and treatment have been recognized as causes of death due to pulmonary TB, and several studies have sought to reduce these delays by identifying factors that should lead to a high index of suspicion [4, 5, 6, 7] . Reasons for missing the diagnosis of TB have included failure to perform appropriate diagnostic investigations and misinterpretation of the radiologic or clinical manifestations of TB as indicating a malignancy, pneumonia or other conditions [8, 9, 10] . Many case reports of acute respiratory failure associated with pulmonary TB have been published [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] .

Patients and methods: Retrospective, 7-year study in two medical intensive care units (ICUs). All patients admitted with pulmonary TB were enrolled. Clinical and laboratory data at admission and events within 48 h of admission were collected. Predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The study included 99 patients with a median age of 41 years. Immunodeficiency was present in 60 patients, including 38 with AIDS.

We developed a portable airborne particlecollection system to measure the viral load; it is equipped with an air sampler to draw air and pass it through a gelatin membrane filter connected to a cone-shaped, megaphone-like device to guide the cough airflow to the membrane. The membrane was dissolved in a medium, and the viral load was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay. The approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10% in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer. Using this system, cough samples were collected from 56 influenza A patients. The total viral detection rate was 41% (23/56), and the viral loads varied significantly (from ,10, less than the detection limit, to 2240 viral gene copies/cough). Viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with #18 plaque forming units per cough sample. The virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons. Among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment, viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group. We found cases with high viral titers in throat swabs or oral secretions but very low or undetectable in coughs and vice versa suggesting other possible anatomical sites where the viruses might be mixed into the cough. Our system is easy to operate, appropriate for bedside use, and is useful for comparing the viral load in cough samples from influenza patients under various conditions and settings. However, further large-scale studies are warranted to validate our results.

936e6e20342454e2646bd840d70148c893262146	Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute, often fatal viral disease characterized by rapid onset of febrile symptoms followed by hemorrhagic manifestations. The etiologic agent, CCHF orthonairovirus (CCHFV), can infect several mammals in nature but only seems to cause clinical disease in humans. Over the past two decades there has been an increase in total number of CCHF case reports, including imported CCHF patients, and an expansion of CCHF endemic areas. Despite its increased public health burden there are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments to prevent CCHF. We here report the development and assessment of the protective efficacy of an adenovirus (Ad)-based vaccine expressing the nucleocapsid protein (N) of CCHFV (Ad-N) in a lethal immunocompromised mouse model of CCHF. The results show that Ad-N can protect mice from CCHF mortality and that this platform should be considered for future CCHFV vaccine strategies.

As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available. As of 29 Jan 2019, 5,997 confirmed and 9,239 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV have been reported from China with 132 deaths confirmed so far 1 . There were cases in at least 15 other countries, identified due to symptoms plus recent travel history to Hubei province, China, which strongly suggests that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the actual number of infected individuals in China 2 . While the most affected region, Hubei province, has now ceased air travel and closed major public transport routes 3 it is unlikely that these measures will fully contain the outbreak. Despite limited evidence for its effectiveness 4,5 , airport screening is frequently implemented to limit the probability of infected cases entering other regions or countries. Here we use the available evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for detecting travellers with 2019-nCoV.

Seroprevalence data is needed to better understand the epidemiology of ECoV in adult horses, evaluate diagnostic modalities and develop preventive measures. The objective of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence and selective risk factors for ECoV in 5247 healthy adult horses in the USA, using a recently established and validated IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Prevalence factors analysed in this study included geographic region, age, breed, sex and use. A total of 504/5247 horses (9.6%) horses tested seropositive. Geographic region (Mid-West; P = 0.008), breed (Draft horses; P = 0.003) and specific uses of horses (ranch/farm, P = 0.034; breeding use, P = 0.016) were all statistically significant risk factors for seropositivity.

250f7b1a48b92d5ca74ba38d2b772fbc7db77fe3	Ultrastructural aspects of St. Louis encephalitis virus infection of the major extraneutral organs and tissues of suckling hamsters were examined. In the pancreas, both the exocrine and endocrine portions were equally affected by the virus. A feature apparently unique to flaviviruses was the accumulation of virus particles in all types of secretory granules in this organ. Virus particles were seen within myocardial fibers and within the smooth muscle cells and endothehal cells of small blood vessels of the heart. In the intestines, the lamina propria was the most severely infected, with virus particles accumulated in all cell types.
2a197ed4d48eae056f22353ce06e5702a6261ee6	Virus metagenomics is a young research filed but it has already transformed our understanding of virus diversity and evolution, and illuminated at a new level the connections between virus evolution and the evolution and ecology of the hosts. In this review article, we examine the new picture of the evolution of RNA viruses, the dominant component of the eukaryotic virome, that is emerging from metagenomic data analysis. The major expansion of many groups of RNA viruses through metagenomics allowed the construction of substantially improved phylogenetic trees for the conserved virus genes, primarily, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). In particular, a new superfamily of widespread, small positive-strand RNA viruses was delineated that unites tombus-like and noda-like viruses. Comparison of the genome architectures of RNA viruses discovered by metagenomics and by traditional methods reveals an extent of gene module shuffling among diverse virus genomes that far exceeds the previous appreciation of this evolutionary phenomenon. Most dramatically, inclusion of the metagenomic data in phylogenetic analyses of the RdRp resulted in the identification of numerous, strongly supported groups that encompass RNA viruses from diverse hosts including different groups of protists, animals and plants. Notwithstanding potential caveats, in particular, incomplete and uneven sampling of eukaryotic taxa, these highly unexpected findings reveal horizontal virus transfer (HVT) between diverse hosts as the central aspect of RNA virus evolution. The vast and diverse virome of invertebrates, particularly nematodes and arthropods, appears to be the reservoir, from which the viromes of plants and vertebrates evolved via multiple HVT events.
0c82f2e6fc8bc8f4d9ce44ddb87f19dd3664db55	By the end of March, 2020, there were more than 180,000 confirmed cases in the US, distributed across more than 2000 counties. We find that the right tail of this distribution exhibits a power law, with Pareto exponent close to one. We investigate whether a simple model of the growth of COVID-19 cases involving Gibrat's law can explain the emergence of this power law. The model is calibrated to match (i) the growth rates of confirmed cases, and (ii) the varying lengths of time during which COVID-19 had been present within each county. Thus calibrated, the model generates a power law with Pareto exponent nearly exactly equal to the exponent estimated directly from the distribution of confirmed cases across counties at the end of March.
8a94d5604fa458cdcfee691b097a4b226262c6e2	The objective of this study was to determine the burden of depressed mood and anxiety in COVID-19, and associated disease characteristics. This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 114 COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed using RT-PCR-based testing over a 6-week period. The 2item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-2) were used to measure depressed mood and anxiety level, respectively, at enrollment and for participants' baseline, pre-COVID-19 state. Severity of smell loss, loss of taste, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea/mucus production, fever, cough and shortness of breath (SOB) during COVID-19 were assessed. Results: PHQ-2 and GAD-2 significantly (p<0.001) increased from baseline to enrollment. PHQ-2 was associated with smell loss (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]=1.40, 95%CI: 1.10-1.78, p=0.006), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.006), and baseline PHQ-2 score (aIRR=1.39, 95%CI: 1.09-1.76, p=0.007). GAD-2 score was associated with smell loss (aIRR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.02-1.62, p=0.035), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.025) and baseline GAD-2 score (aIRR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.24-1.93, p<0.001). Loss of taste also exhibited similar associations with PHQ-2 and GAD-2. PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were not associated with severities of any other symptoms during the COVID-19 course. Despite the occurrence of symptoms-such as SOB-associated with severe manifestations of COVID-19, only the severities of smell and taste loss were This article is protected by copyright.

These results may raise the novel possibility of emotional disturbance as a CNS manifestation of COVID-19 given transolfactory tract penetration of the central nervous system (CNS) by coronaviruses.
5749bf010ff6b850774304cb028e97beb223520b	The aim of this study was to analyze the impact coronavirus disease 2019 had in Argentina during its initial stage, identify the measures taken to try to mitigate its impact, and briefly compare it with the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in 2009. This is a descriptive study. Pandemics constitute a serious problem to global health with a major impact on the affected countries' populations. The recent COVID-19 outbreak represents one of the most important viral pandemics lately. It reached Argentina 64 days after the first case was identified in China. Since then, several measures were taken by the Argentinian government to try to mitigate its impact in this initial stage. An updated report of the current situation and its management in different countries is of vital importance regarding global health issues and may serve for feedback and decision-making.

1b3c8dde9f0874643453a12b20c7b9e6646b7975	This study develops a holistic view of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread worldwide through a spatial-temporal model with network dynamics. By using a unique human mobility dataset containing 547 166 flights with a total capacity of 101 455 913 passengers from January 22 to April 24, 2020, we analyze the epidemic correlations across 22 countries in six continents and particularly the changes in such correlations before and after implementing the international travel restriction policies targeting different countries. Results show that policymakers should move away from the previous practices that focus only on restricting hotspot areas with high infection rates. Instead, they should develop a new holistic view of global human mobility to impose the international movement restriction. The study further highlights potential correlations between international human mobility and focal countries' epidemic situations in the global network of COVID-19 pandemic.
2f70fc601b4d40ff368df47cf606721f7212c635	Human longevity is a complex phenotype with a strong genetic predisposition. Increasing evidence has revealed the genetic antecedents of human longevity. This article aims to review the data of various case/control association studies that examine the difference in genetic polymorphisms between long-lived people and younger subjects across different human populations. There are more than 100 candidate genes potentially involved in human longevity; this article particularly focuses on genes of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, FOXO3A, FOXO1A, lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., APOE and PON1), and cell-cycle regulators (e.g., TP53 and P21). Since the confirmed genetic components for human longevity are few to date, further precise assessment of the genetic contributions is required. Gaining a better understanding of the contribution of genetics to human longevity may assist in the design of improved treatment methods for age-related diseases, delay the aging process, and, ultimately, prolong the human lifespan.
a2e67630efebec8c4b6a11a8a68b1aea38eb6bd4	The rapid spread of the COVID-19 demands immediate response from the scientific communities. Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human 1 proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions. The outbreak of the COVID-19 disease affects humans all over the globe. More and more people get sick and many die because of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. The whole machinery of this pathogen is enclosed in a short sequence of nucleotides, building blocks for both RNA and DNA strands. This RNA virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies. Its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids (building bricks) that are usually used quite freely by proteins. However, there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used. We name those low complexity regions (LCRs). We invented the first programmes able to compare such LCRs. Using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones. This discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs. It means that companies should not use these very LCRs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease. On the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells.
fbe911874dc145916c143a2ca51a448dcdc75978	The spike (S) gene of the attenuated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) DR13 was cloned and sequenced to further explore the functions of wild type PEDV and attenuated PEDV. Sequencing revealed a single large ORF of 4,149 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1,382 amino acids with predicted M r of 151 kDa. The coding region of the S gene of attenuated PEDV DR13 had 20 nucleotide changes that appeared to be significant determinants of function in that they produced changes in its predicted amino acid sequence. Notably, attenuated PEDV DR13 has previously been found to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in pigs. The regions containing these 20 nucleotide changes may therefore be crucial for PEDV pathogenicity. The attenuated PEDV DR13 S protein contains 28 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons, 21 asparagines that are predicted to be N-glycosylated and a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues at positions 1,327-1,347, which is predicted to form an a-helix and to function as a membrane anchor. One (from N to K at 378) of the changes in the deduced amino acid sequence destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites, while another change (from N to S at 114) created a new one at a different location. These alterations in N-linked glycosylation sites reflected 3 nucleotide changes, which were related to the abovementioned nucleotide changes and are suggested to influence the pathogenicity of attenuated PEDV DR13. Attenuated PEDV DR13 has 96.5, 96.4, 96.1, 93.9, 93.5 and 96.6% DNA sequence identities with CV777, Br1/87, JS-2004-2, Spk1, Chinju99 and parent DR13, respectively. Likewise, it shares 95.7, 95.4, 95.6, 92.0, 91.6 and 95.7% identity with those genes at the deduced amino acid sequence level. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that attenuated PEDV DR13 is closely related to CV777, Br1/87, JS-2004-2 and parent DR13, rather than to Spk1 and Chinju99 and is especially close to the Chinese PEDV strain JS-2004-2.
73c383b774ec4658f4e3cb226e40c4c7db8e7e52	This study evaluates trends in workforce supply compared with those in the volume of service delivery (output) for basic clinical care (CC) and public health (PH) services from 2009 to 2017 in China. A cross-sectional survey (2018) was combined with retrospective data (2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017) from 785 primary care (PC) facilities in six provinces. Measures for the output of clinical care and of public health services were aggregated into a single (weighted) index for both service profiles. The output-workforce relationship was measured by its ratio. Latent class growth analysis and logistic regression analysis were applied to classify trajectories and determine associations with facility-level, geographic, and economic characteristics. From 2009 to 2017, the proportion of PC to overall healthcare workforce decreased from 24.25% to 18.57%; the proportion of PH to PC providers at PC facilities increased from 23.6% to 29.5%, while the proportion of PH output increased from 44.3% to 65.9%. Four trajectories of the output-workforce relationship were identified for CC, and five trajectories for PH services of which 85.3% of the facilities showed initially increasing and then slightly decreasing trends. Geographic characteristics impacted different trajectories. The PC workforce falls behind hospital workforce. The expansion in workload of PH services is unbalanced with that of workforce.
15a0a1f83c9f096d245ed2c77d96f3bdf0a2f95a	Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections continue to be a serious emerging disease problem internationally with well over 1000 cases and a major outbreak outside of the Middle East region. While the hypothesis that dromedary camels are the likely major source of MERS-CoV infection in humans is gaining acceptance, conjecture continues over the original natural reservoir host(s) and specifically the role of bats in the emergence of the virus. Dromedary camels were imported to Australia, principally between 1880 and 1907 and have since become a large feral population inhabiting extensive parts of the continent. Here we report that during a focussed surveillance study, no serological evidence was found for the presence of MERS-CoV in the camels in the Australian population. This finding presents various hypotheses about the timing of the emergence and spread of MERS-CoV throughout populations of camels in Africa and Asia, which can be partially resolved by testing sera from camels from the original source region, which we have inferred was mainly northwestern Pakistan. In addition, we identify bat species which overlap (or neighbour) the range of the Australian camel population with a higher likelihood of carrying CoVs of the same lineage as MERS-CoV. Both of these proposed follow-on studies are examples of "proactive surveillance", a concept that has particular relevance to a One Health approach to emerging zoonotic diseases with a complex epidemiology and aetiology.

cec48f31797ef2c7dde2eee8426a985687a09684	Background: Bubonic plague is the primary manifestation of infection with Yersinia pestis, accounting for 90% of all plague cases and with 75% of global cases reported in Madagascar. All drugs in use for treating plague are registered based on experimental data and anecdotal evidence, and no regimen currently recommended is supported by a randomized clinical trial. The IMASOY trial intends to fill this knowledge gap by comparing two 10-day regimens included in the national guidelines in Madagascar. The primary objective of the trial is to test the hypothesis that ciprofloxacin monotherapy is non-inferior to streptomycin followed by ciprofloxacin for the treatment of bubonic plague, thus avoiding the need for injectable, potentially toxic, aminoglycosides. Methods: A two-arm parallel-group randomized control trial will be conducted across peripheral health centres in Madagascar in five districts. Males and non-pregnant females of all ages with suspected bubonic or pneumonic plague will be recruited over the course of three plague 'seasons'. The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the proportion of patients with bubonic plague who have a therapeutic response to treatment (defined as alive, resolution of fever, 25% reduction in the size of measurable buboes, has not received an alternative treatment and no clinical decision to continue antibiotics) as assessed on day 11. Discussion: If successful, the trial has the potential to inform the standard of care guidelines not just in Madagascar but in other countries afflicted by plague. The trial is currently ongoing and expected to complete recruitment in 2022.
93a9d87c746a8eaa230e59f1a976fc50f1a8208f	In response to COVID-19, seed security interventions are being planned to help bolster fragile livelihoods. After 25 years of research during emergencies, there are many lessons to build on, including that seed systems, especially informal markets, prove fairly resilient and often function even in high stress contexts. As a wise first step, given the possible volatility in supply, farmers' seed saving should be supported actively and at scale. Rigorous remote assessments will have to become the new norm for gauging seed security, with reviews recognizing that different crops might be affected in different ways by specific seed channel stress or breakdown. Well-known short-term seed security responses, for example, Direct Seed Distribution, will need to be tailored to the new COVID-19 reality, particularly in terms of altering logistics. More fundamentally, three new factors might herald a transformation in response: 1) Choice for farmers has to be the operative principle (especially as markets may fluctuate quickly); 2) Remote two-way 'state of the art' communication has to be built rapidly; and 3) Seed quality options might need to be liberalized, especially given the scale of possible seed security intervention. Covid-19 effects will likely linger several years or potentially six to nine seasons (depending on agricultural calendar). Now might be the time to move from stop-gap responses (and repetitive ones) to more sustainable and powerful market-led support, with particular emphasis on responses that leverage and strengthen the informal sector markets.
3ef316cced2d887ad6063cc0dd01ec890849ce07	We found tha: rats subjected to thermal skin injury (bum) had increased serum hydrogen peroxide (H202) scavenging activity, serum catalase activity, erythrocyte (RBC) fragility, and edematous lung injury (lung leak) when compared to sham-treated rats. Serum H202 scavenging activity was inhibited by addition of sodium azide, a catalase inhibitor. Treatment of rats with the oxygen radical scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), decreased RBC fragility and lung leak but did not alter increased H2Oz scavenging or catalase activity of serum from rats subjected to skin bum. We conclude that increased serum catalase activity is a consequence of thermal skin injury and that increased serum catalase activity may be a mechanism that modulates HzO2-dependent processes following skin bum.
407f7803c096776b4d4f8f5ce05a97ebe6886dff	Biomedical applications increasingly require fully characterized new nanomaterials. There is strong evidence showing that nanomaterials not only interact with cells passively but also actively, mediating essential molecular processes for the regulation of cellular functions, but we are only starting to understand the mechanisms of those interactions. Systematic studies about cell behavior as a response to specific nanoparticle properties are scarce in the literature even when they are necessary for the rational design of medical nanodevices. Information in the literature shows that the physicochemical properties determine the bioactivity, biocompatibility, and safety of nanomaterials. The information available regarding the interaction and responses of cells to nanomaterials has not been analyzed and discussed in a single document. Hence, in this review, we present the latest advances about cellular responses to nanomaterials and integrate the available information into concrete considerations for the development of innovative, efficient, specific and, more importantly, safe biomedical nanodevices. We focus on how physicochemical nanoparticle properties (size, chemical surface, shape, charge, and topography) influence cell behavior in a first attempt to provide a practical guide for designing medical nanodevices, avoiding common experimental omissions that may lead to data misinterpretation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the systematic study of nano-bio interactions to acquire sufficient reproducible information that allows accurate control of cell behavior based on tuning of nanomaterial properties. This information is useful to guide the design of specific nanodevices and nanomaterials to elicit desired cell responses, like targeting, drug delivery, cell attachment, differentiation, etc, or to avoid undesired side effects.

4b1e72eba134b10dbbf95ff784568eeb0c6e9bec	In this projection exercise, we analyzed the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh and used multiple methods to characterize the epidemic curve. We merged several publicly available data sets for the purpose. Projections using actual Government data as of June 16, 2020 reveals that the epidemic curve for Bangladesh may be different from that of developed countries and quite similar to such curves in countries in the region. This is true, both in terms of incidence of cases (total number of cases per million population) and length of the epidemic (months to peak or flatten the epidemic curve). We find that while Bangladesh went into lockdown early, efforts to maintain lockdown at a national level was relaxed and new cases accelerated; with significant growth happening since lifting of lockdown on May 31. Our estimates indicate prevalence of COVID-19 may be between 200,000 and 600,000 towards end of the year, may take 9 months (270 days) to flatten the epidemic curve, lifting of the lockdown may have increased total cases by 60 to 100% and may have prolonged the epidemic by additional 2-3 months. : medRxiv preprint 3 Most infected with COVID-19 do not show any symptoms and those that do have fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache and conjunctivitis (4). The course of the infection is mild for most infected; thus 80-90% recover without any serious impacts; however, about 10% may have trouble breathing and low blood oxygen level and require hospitalization. A further 5% may experience life threatening condition such as respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. Thus, case fatality rate, defined as percentage of infected patients who may die, for COVID-19 range from 2-5% and this percentage increases with age and for those with chronic comorbid conditions such as diabetes, asthma and heart disease. Thus spread of COVID-19 in Bangladesh poses a significant threat; and without active intervention by Government, even if a small percentage of the population, say 5%, are infected, this translates to 8,000,000 needing hospitalization and over 200,000 deaths. Observing the spread and potential significant health effects, many researchers estimated potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic to help policy makers prepare respective countries and their systems to face this pandemic. The main thrust of these estimations has been to encourage policy makers to implement strong Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) such as social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing of face masks, self quarantining, all to reduce the potential spread of the pandemic (6). Research has also found that testing and isolating or quarantining infected persons may mitigate the spread of the infection (7). These estimations use epidemiologic models such as the Suspected-Infected-Recovery (SIR) model to project the number of infected cases, number of deaths and potential demand for health care, specially hospital ICU use during times of the peak of pandemic (8). Subsequent studies focused on the impact of NPI on the spread of the disease. One such study was by Ferguson et al. published on March 16, 2020 (9). Without strong NPI, the study estimated that R 0 , which is a measure of rate of infection transmission, could be about 2.4 and about 80% of the population would be infected in UK and US and about 2.2M people would die in USA alone. With NPI and other mitigation efforts, the study noted that health care system would be overwhelmed and deaths in US would reach about 1.1M to 1.2M people. Less than two weeks later, a study by Murray et al (10) predicted that even with strong NPI estimated deaths over a 4month period would be about 81,000 in the US. A Canadian study estimated initial infection rate of 56% in Ontario, Canada and NPI could reduce that infection rate to 2%(11). A recent .

5e095761210e537f91067c12ce46f396c0338175	Currently, treating COVID-19 patients, particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia, is challenging as no specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Therefore, MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking. Additional studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate this therapeutic intervention further, however.
49d290076b8c6c52dc7780d2902c4de9fbe02ad6	Background-Family caregivers are integral to patient care in Bangladeshi public hospitals. This study explored family caregivers' activities and their perceptions and practices related to disease transmission and prevention in public hospitals. Methods-Trained qualitative researchers conducted a total of 48 hours of observation in 3 public tertiary care hospitals and 12 in-depth interviews with family caregivers. Results-Family caregivers provided care 24 hours a day, including bedside nursing, cleaning care, and psychologic support. During observations, family members provided 2,065 episodes of care giving, 75% (1,544) of which involved close contact with patients. We observed family caregivers washing their hands with soap on only 4 occasions. The majority of respondents said diseases are transmitted through physical contact with surfaces and objects that have been contaminated with patient secretions and excretions, and avoiding contact with these contaminated objects would help prevent disease. Conclusion-Family caregivers are at risk for hospital-acquired infection from their repeated exposure to infectious agents combined with their inadequate hand hygiene and knowledge about disease transmission. Future research should explore potential strategies to improve family caregivers' knowledge about disease transmission and reduce family caregiver exposures, which may be accomplished by improving care provided by health care workers.
80d5cbaba20857c15230efbd66742fbbedcd6cb9	The purpose of this descriptive study was to, from the perspective of adult people with epilepsy (PWE) and caregivers of PWE, explore the effects of the current pandemic and resulting societal changes on epilepsy selfmanagement. Ninety-four respondents completed a mixed-methods quantitative and qualitative survey focused on their epilepsy self-management experiences during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Respondents noted significant disruption in epilepsy self-management. Lack of ability to obtain medications or see epilepsy providers, as well as increased stress, social isolation, and changes in routine were all reported as troublesome, and more than one-third of the sample reported an increase in seizure frequency since the onset of the pandemic. Suggestions are given regarding how to support PWE during future COVID-19 outbreaks and to better prepare PWE and their caregivers for any life-altering events, such as a pandemic, with robust self-management skills that will allow them to maintain the highest level of function possible.
33844b63c8c5df927ce815ef6e5a72dd68b67210	Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ABSTRACT The current coronavirus-19 pandemic has changed dramatically how neurologists care for children and adults with epilepsy. Stay-at-home orders and resistance to hospitalizations by patients have led epileptologists to engage in telemedicine and re-evaluate how to provide elective services. Ketogenic diet therapy is often started in the hospital, with families educated in hospital-based classes, but this is difficult to do in this current pandemic. At our two academic centers, both our pediatric and adult epilepsy diet centers have had to quickly consider alternative methods to both start and maintain ketogenic diet therapy. This paper provides several examples of how ketogenic diet therapy can be provided to patients in unique ways, along with recommendations from other experts and patients learned over the past few months.

01fe9408aa72a025bad89a695b389c4e509ed67d	Low-and middle-income countries, where emerging diseases often make their debut, are also likely to bear the harshest consequences of a potential influenza pandemic. Yet public health systems in developing countries are underfunded, understaffed, and in many cases struggling to deal with the existing burden of disease. As a result, developed countries are beginning to expand assistance for emergency preparedness to the developing world. Given developing countries' weak infrastructure and many competing public health priorities, it is not clear how to best direct these resources. Evidence from the U.S. and other developed countries suggests that some investments in bioterror and pandemic emergency preparedness, although initially implemented as vertical programs, have the potential to strengthen the general public health infrastructure. This experience may hold some lessons for how global funds for emergency preparedness could be invested in developing countries to support struggling public health systems in responding to current health priorities as well as potential future public health threats.

68b905ee32b8aad54ae9006fc7aab007c63e9895	Background: Microbial forensics is important in tracking the source of a pathogen, whether the disease is a naturally occurring outbreak or part of a criminal investigation. Results: A method and SPR Opt (SNP and PCR-RFLP Optimization) software to perform a comprehensive, whole-genome analysis to forensically discriminate multiple sequences is presented. Tools for the optimization of forensic typing using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analyses across multiple isolate sequences of a species are described. The PCR-RFLP analysis includes prediction and selection of optimal primers and restriction enzymes to enable maximum isolate discrimination based on sequence information. SPR Opt calculates all SNP or PCR-RFLP variations present in the sequences, groups them into haplotypes according to their co-segregation across those sequences, and performs combinatoric analyses to determine which sets of haplotypes provide maximal discrimination among all the input sequences. Those set combinations requiring that membership in the fewest haplotypes be queried (i.e. the fewest assays be performed) are found. These analyses highlight variable regions based on existing sequence data. These markers may be heterogeneous among unsequenced isolates as well, and thus may be useful for characterizing the relationships among unsequenced as well as sequenced isolates. The predictions are multi-locus. Analyses of mumps and SARS viruses are summarized. Phylogenetic trees created based on SNPs, PCR-RFLPs, and full genomes are compared for SARS virus, illustrating that purported phylogenies based only on SNP or PCR-RFLP variations do not match those based on multiple sequence alignment of the full genomes. Conclusion: This is the first software to optimize the selection of forensic markers to maximize information gained from the fewest assays, accepting whole or partial genome sequence data as input. As more sequence data becomes available for multiple strains and isolates of a species, automated, computational approaches such as those described here will be essential to make sense of large amounts of information, and to guide and optimize efforts in the laboratory. The software and source code for SPR Opt is publicly available and free for non-profit use at

7c5a6855bf1218f6f4c7238f0ceda906f91e72f3	Aims and objectives Oral health deteriorates following hospitalisation in critical care units (CCU) but there are no validated measures to assess effects on oral health-related quality of life (OHQoL). The objectives of this study were (i) to develop a tool (CCU-OHQoL) to assess OHQoL amongst patients admitted to CCU, (ii) to collect data to analyse the validity, reliability and acceptability of the CCU-OHQoL tool and (iii) to investigate patient-reported outcome measures of OHQoL in patients hospitalised in a CCU. Methods The project included three phases: (1) the development of an initial questionnaire informed by a literature review and expert panel, (2) testing of the tool in CCU (n = 18) followed by semi-structured interviews to assess acceptability, face and content validity and (3) final tool modification and testing of CCU-OHQoL questionnaire to assess validity and reliability. Results The CCU-OHQoL showed good face and content validity and was quick to administer. Cronbach's alpha was 0.72 suggesting good internal consistency. For construct validity, the CCU-OHQoL was strongly and significantly correlated (correlation coefficients 0.71, 0.62 and 0.77, p < 0.01) with global OHQoL items. In the validation study, 37.8% of the participants reported a deterioration in self-reported oral health after CCU admission. Finally, 26.9% and 31% of the participants reported considerable negative impacts of oral health in their life overall and quality of life, respectively. Conclusions The new CCU-OHQoL tool may be of use in the assessment of oral health-related quality of life in CCU patients. Deterioration of OHQoL seems to be common in CCU patients.

4d8bc27599f1bb09b2b8402de15f158797445996	Health crises have become a popular topic of discussion. In the wave of the ongoing pandemic, experts have suggested the role of vaping and other tobacco product use exemplifying the vulnerability of the population to contract the COVID-19. We discuss some of the events that led up to these conclusions and also offer a unique insight into another form of tobacco use that is potentially propagating its spread especially in the South Asian region-chewed tobacco. Both of these have been a perennial issue that head and neck cancer surgeons have been dealing with. Governments and head and neck cancer care providers now have an opportunity to deal with a common enemy in the midst of this pandemic.
a6ae8afd89a278eb8d96cfc058988f99782e1645	Background: Surveillance of winter respiratory viral illness has been carried out for nearly 30 years using a clinical diagnosis by general practitioners as part of the Scottish Sentinel General Practice (SSGP) network. Contemparaneous laboratory diagnosis has not been available previously. Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness. PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance. Serology is slow, insensitive and difficult to interpret at low titres.

413227edb89564cc432e35e54b4455e72f44e8d1	The spike (S) glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the predominant inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been implicated in virulence and host cell tropism. In this study, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene of one Korean field TGEV strain (133) isolated in 1997 and three Korean field TGEV strains (KT2, KT3 and KT4) isolated in 2000 and HKT2 strain, KT2 passaged 104 times in ST cells, were determined. The amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene including antigenic sites A, B, C and D, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Amplified PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and compared with published sequences for non-Korean TGEV strains. Korea TGEV field strains had 98.5-99.5% nucleotide sequence and 97.2-99.0% amino acid sequence similarity with each other. They had 96.5-99.0% nucleotide sequence similarity and 94.9-97.6% amino acid sequence similarity compared to non-Korean TGEV strains. Korean TGEV strains had several specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences which were not found in foreign TGEV or PRCV strains. HKT2 strain differed by 0.89% in nucleotide and 2.03% amino acid sequences compared to original KT2 strain although the regions forming four antigenic sites were not changed. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean field TGEV strains were branched into different groups from non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains. Korean TGEV field strains KT2 and 133 were branched in separate groups that were differentiated from the other Korean TGEV strains. The Korean TGEV strains seemed to be evolved from a separate lineage of TGEV strain.
286700f1ebaaabe1a535c42c9f3d0a37be23491a	Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a ubiquitous cis-trans prolyl isomerase with key roles in immunity and viral infection. CypA suppresses T-cell activation through cyclosporine complexation and is required for effective HIV-1 replication in host cells. We show that CypA is acetylated in diverse human cell lines and use a synthetically evolved acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA CUA pair to produce recombinant acetylated CypA in Escherichia coli. We determined atomic-resolution structures of acetylated CypA and its complexes with cyclosporine and HIV-1 capsid. Acetylation markedly inhibited CypA catalysis of cis to trans isomerization and stabilized cis rather than trans forms of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, CypA acetylation antagonized the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine by inhibiting the sequential steps of cyclosporine binding and calcineurin inhibition. Our results reveal that acetylation regulates key functions of CypA in immunity and viral infection and provide a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation modulates interactions to regulate cell function.

5aaab7669c5a2677c3c5d3bf6dd2bde1b67c79d8	The China-US Cooperation-Global AIDS Program (GAP) was a strategic technical collaboration program jointly implemented by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This program developed, piloted, launched, and evaluated a broad range of projects supporting national and local HIV prevention and control programs; evidence-based decision-making; strengthening systems and capacity at national, provincial, and local levels; prioritizing high-risk geographic areas and populations; developing innovative approaches for scale-up; answering important scientific questions that can be most effectively answered in China but also with global implications for the HIV response; and increasing China's engagement with the global public health community and sharing critical lessons learned. A productive working relationship with well-conceived models, a results-based activity implementation plan, and proper linkage to the domestic policy process has made a significant contribution to HIV control and prevention in China.
0518338a4ffd3384f14e259030b95bd07f71900c	Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) such as HCoV-229E or OC43 are responsible for mild upper airway infections, whereas highly pathogenic HCoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, often evoke acute, heavy pneumonias. They tend to induce immune responses based on interferon and host inflammatory cytokine production and promotion of T1 immune profile. Less is known about their effect on T2-type immunity. Unlike human rhinoviruses (HRV) and rhinosyncytioviruses (RSV), HCoVs are not considered as a dominant risk factor of severe exacerbations of asthma, mostly T2-type chronic inflammatory disease. The relationship between coronaviruses and T2-type immunity, especially in asthma and allergy, is not well understood. This review aims to summarise currently available knowledge about the relationship of HCoVs, including novel SARS-CoV-2, with asthma and allergic inflammation.

5a0f78d157629e8929ac78ea6da0f0148f5900a8	Therapeutic medicine today includes a vast number of procedures involving the use of biomaterials, transplantation of therapeutic cells or cell clusters, as well as of solid organs. These treatment modalities are obviously of great benefit to the patient, but also present a great challenge to the innate immune system, since they involve direct exposure of non-biological materials, cells of non-hematological origin as well as endothelial cells, damaged by ischemia-perfusion in solid organs to proteins and cells in the blood. The result of such an exposure may be an inappropriate activation of the complement and contact/kallikrein systems, which produce mediators capable of triggering the platelets and PMNs and monocytes, which can ultimately result in thrombotic and inflammatory (i.e., a thrombo-inflammatory) response to the treatment modality. In this concept review, we give an overview of the mechanisms of recognition within the innate immunity system, with the aim to identify suitable points for intervention. Finally, we discuss emerging and promising techniques for surface modification of biomaterials and cells with specific inhibitors in order to diminish thromboinflammation and improve clinical outcome.
e2da25879ef605f8c5d598a47db610eb36aefe22	COVID-19 is undoubtedly the most impactful viral disease of the current century, afflicting millions worldwide. As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of both drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for potential therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2 infections.
a8211f17587bc74889f33658df638c91eb8443f1	Traditionally, the identification of parameters in the formulation and solution of inverse problems considers that models, variables and mathematical parameters are free of uncertainties. This aspect simplifies the estimation process, but does not consider the influence of relatively small changes in the design variables in terms of the objective function. In this work, the SIDR (Susceptible, Infected, Dead and Recovered) model is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease , and its parameters are estimated by formulating a robust inverse problem, that is, considering the sensitivity of design variables. For this purpose, a robust multiobjective optimization problem is formulated, considering the minimization of uncertainties associated to the estimation process and the maximization of the robustness parameter. To solve this problem, the Multi-objective Stochastic Fractal Search algorithm is associated with the Effective Mean concept for the evaluation of robustness. The results obtained considering real data of the epidemic in China demonstrate that the evaluation of the sensitivity of the design variables can provide more reliable results.
5036d9acb850bbb3705be78b3ab64dec35d68b27	Background: The term triaditis designates the concurrent presence of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cholangitis, and pancreatitis in cats. Hypothesis/Objectives: The histopathology of concurrent, but often subclinical, inflammatory processes in the small intestine, liver, and pancreas of cats is poorly described. We aimed to investigate the frequency of enteritis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, or some combination of these in symptomatic and asymptomatic cats, compare clinicopathological features, and correlate histopathological with laboratory findings. Animals: Domestic cats (27 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic, and 8 normal). Methods: Prospective study. Physical examination, laboratory variables (CBC, serum biochemistry profile, serum thyroxine concentration, serum feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity [fTLI], feline lipase immunoreactivity [fPLI, as measured by Spec fPL Ò ], urinalysis, and fecal analysis), imaging, and histopathological examinations were conducted. Feline liver, pancreas, and small intestine were biopsied during laparotomy. Results: Inflammatory lesions were detected in 47 cats (27 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic). In total, 20 cats had histopathologic lesions of IBD (13/47, 27.7%), cholangitis (6/47, 12.8%), or pancreatitis (1/47, 2.1%) alone, or inflammation involving >1 organ (27/47, 57.4%). More specifically, 16/47 cats (34.0%) had concurrent lesions of IBD and cholangitis, 3/47 (6.4%) of IBD and pancreatitis, and 8/47 cats (17%) of triaditis. Triaditis was identified only in symptomatic cats (8/27, 29.6%). A mild, positive correlation was detected between the severity (score) of IBD lesions and the number of comorbidities (rho = +0.367, P = .022). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Histopathological evidence of IBD or IBD with comorbidities was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cats. The possibility of triaditis should be considered in symptomatic cats with severe IBD.
6ed7e9e3f055cd2aeb20bd091077298c2f22b97a	Usage of a face mask has become mandatory in many countries after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and its usefulness in combating the pandemic is a proven fact. There have been many advancements in the design of a face mask and the present treatise describes a face mask in which a simple textile triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) serves the purpose of filtration of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer protection sheets, in which the first two layers act as triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one is a smart filter. The conjugated effect of contact electrification, and electrostatic induction of the proposed smart mask are effective in inactivating the span of virus-ladden aerosols in a bidirectional way. Five pairs of triboseries fabrics i.e. nylon -polyester, cotton -polyester, poly(methyl methacrylate) -PVDF, lylon -PVDF and polypropylene -polyester have been optimized in this study in terms of their effective triboelectric charge densities as 83.13, 211.48, 38.62, 69 and 74.25 nC/m 2 , respectively. This smart mask can be used by a wide range of people because of its simple mechanism, self-driven (harvesting mechanical energy from daily activities, e.g. breathing, talking, or other facial movements functionalities, and effective filtration efficiency and thus, it is expected to be potentially beneficial to slow down the devastating impact of COVID-19.
cd647d7a713473dec4f8378f15d457bf0b781a6f	Background Esophageal replacement is a challenge to the therapeutic skills of surgeons and a technically demanding operation in the pediatric age group. Various conduits and routes have been described in the literature, each with their specific advantages and disadvantages. We carried out this retrospective study to share our experience of esophageal replacement. Methodology This study was conducted at the department of pediatric surgery The Children's Hospital and The Institute of Child Health, Lahore. The records of patients treated for esophageal replacement were reviewed. The patients under followup were called for clinical evaluation and assessed of long terms complications if any. Results A total of 93 patients with esophageal replacement were included in the study. Esophageal replacement was done with gastric transposition in 84 cases (90%), colon interposition in 7 cases (7.5%) including one case of redo colonic interposition, and jejunal interposition in 2 cases (2%). Routes of esophageal replacement were trans-hiatal in 71 (76%), retrosternal in 13 (14%), and trans-hiatal with thoracotomy in 9 (10%) patients. Postoperatively, all of the conduits maintained viability. Wound infection was seen in 10 (11%), wound dehiscence in 5 (5%), anastomotic leak in 9 (10%), anastomotic stenosis in 12 (13%), fistula formation in 4 (4%), aortic injury 1 (1%), dumping syndrome 8 (9%), reflux 18 (19%), dysphagia 15 (16%) and death occurred in 12 patients (13%). Conclusion There are problems with esophageal replacement in developing countries. In this context, gastric conduit appeared as the best conduit for esophageal replacement, using the trans-hiatal route for replacement, in the authors' experience.
fe31b8de57488395e5386a4922aec8d0511f646e	Generalizing COVID-19 control strategies in one community to others is confounded by community's unique demographic and socioeconomic attributes. Here we propose a tailored dynamic model accounting for community-specific transmission controls and medical resource availability. We trained the model using data from Wuhan and applied it to other countries. We show that isolating suspected cases is most effective in reducing transmission rate if the intervention starts early. Having more hospital beds provides leverage that diminishes with delayed intervention onset. The importance of transmission control in turn increases by 65% with a 7-day delay. Furthermore, prolonging outbreak duration by applying an intermediate, rather than strict, transmission control would not prevent hospital overload regardless of bed capacity, and would likely result in a high ratio (21% ~ 84%) of the population being infected but not treated. The model could help different countries design control policies and gauge the severity of suppression failure.
b4fafe6eeaa973831f1b0b031abbfe9d68e000a2	joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Johns Hopkins Medicine International), several initiatives were taken by the hospital's inpatient pharmacy department with focus on infection control, staffing, meeting clinical operational challenges, ethics, increased utilization of automation, and maintenance of employee wellness to prepare for this challenge. The plan implemented by the inpatient pharmacy department was prepared while incorporating information and recommendations from leading pharmacy organizations, ministry of health, institute's experience in battling another similar coronavirus (the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) previously, and updated scientific research. The key focus areas include development of an institutionalized COVID-19 protocol, measures to improve infection control when handling and dispensing medications, modified staffing plan, system changes in peri-operative areas, keeping pharmacy professionals updated about new and scientific researches, increased utilization of automation, clinical interventions by pharmacist ensuring appropriate utilization of medications while monitoring for drug-drug interactions, adverse drug event prevention, and preparing for handling drug shortages. By implementing a robust plan, pharmacy professionals continue to show that they are an integral member of inter-professional health care teams.
56c5ad79b78bf204f41391880e9cd6cc747ae394	The phenomenon of dynamic stall produce adverse aerodynamic loading which can adversely affect the structural strength and life of aerodynamic systems. Aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) provides an effective approach for delaying and mitigating dynamic stall characteristics without the addition of auxiliary system. ASO, however, requires multiple evaluations time-consuming computational fluid dynamics models. Metamodel-based optimization (MBO) provides an efficient approach to alleviate the computational burden. In this study, the MBO approach is utilized for the mitigation of dynamic stall characteristics while delaying dynamic stall angle of the flow past wind turbine airfoils. The regression Kriging metamodeling technique is used to approximate the objective and constrained functions. The airfoil shape design variables are described with six PARSEC parameters. A total of 60 initial samples are used to construct the metamodel, which is further refined with 20 infill points using expected improvement. The metamodel is validated with the normalized root mean square error based on 20 test data samples. The refined metamodel is used to search for the optimal design using a multi-start gradient-based method. The results show that an optimal design with a 3 • delay in dynamic stall angle as well a reduction in the severity of pitching moment coefficients can be obtained.
e9b51cbdc9304e6d96a3efac0a666beed6fd75a1	Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respi ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respi ratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare. A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerg ing as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2-6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 Where next? Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish nonspecific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalo pathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.
c2eeb85dc8ef7ff94542a025709c0b34e971297d	Given session-based news watch history of users, how can we precisely recommend news articles? Unlike other items for recommendation, the worth of news articles decays quickly and various news sources publish fresh ones every second. Moreover, people frequently select news articles regardless of their personal preferences to understand popular topics at a specific time. Conventional recommendation methods, designed for other recommendation domains, give low performance because of these peculiarities of news articles. In this paper, we propose PGT (News Recommendation Coalescing Personal and Global Temporal Preferences), an accurate news recommendation method designed with consideration of the above characteristics of news articles. PGT extracts latent features from both personal and global temporal preferences to sufficiently reflect users' behaviors. Furthermore, we propose an attention based architecture to extract adequate coalesced features from both of the preferences. Experimental results show that PGT provides the most accurate news recommendation, giving the state-of-the-art accuracy.
21401f48a0c55fbc9623278bf6790db8e11dbe4e	The rapid and pandemic spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented containment policies in response to overloaded health care systems. Disease mitigation strategies require informed decision-making to ensure a balance between the protection of the vulnerable from disease and the maintenance of global economies. We show that temporally restricted containment efforts, 15 that have the potential to flatten epidemic curves, can result in wider disease spread and larger epidemic sizes in metapopulations. Longer-term rewiring of metapopulation networks or the enforcement of feasible long-term measures that decrease disease transmissions appear to be more efficient than temporarily restricted intensive mitigation strategies (e.g. short-term mass quarantine). Our results may inform balanced containment strategies for short-term disease 20 spread mitigation in response to overloaded health care systems and longer-term epidemiological sizes.

Exploring a new strategy for manufacturing and delivering a safe and effective H7N9 vaccine is needed urgently. Results: An alternative approach is to develop an influenza H7N9 oral vaccine based on yeast display technology in a timely manner. Hemagglutinin (HA) of A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH-H7N9) is used as a model antigen and characterized its expression on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.cerevisiae) EBY 100. Mice administrated orally with S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA produced significant titers of IgG antibody as well as significant amounts of cytokines IFN-γ and IL-4. Importantly, S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA could provide effective immune protection against homologous A/ Anhui/1/2013 (AH-H7N9) virus challenge. Our findings suggest that platform based on yeast surface technology provides an alternative approach to prepare a promising influenza H7N9 oral vaccine candidate that can significantly shorten the preparedness period and result in effective protection against influenza A pandemic.
de0f0fe236475ea98c9c5307a5ac7acb0e706c8a	Since the outbreak of COVID-19, clinicians have tried every effort to fight the disease, and multiple drugs have been proposed. However, no proven effective therapies currently exist, and different clinical phenotypes complicate the situation. In clinical practice, many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, including vomiting, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain, even in the absence of cough and dyspnea. Understanding the mechanism of GI disturbances is warranted for exploring better clinical care for COVID-19 patients. With evidence collected from clinical studies on COVID-19 and basic research on a rare genetic disease (i.e., Hartnup disorder), we put forward a novel hypothesis to elaborate an effective nutritional therapy. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binding to intestinal angiotensinconverting enzyme 2, negatively regulates the absorption of neutral amino acids, and this could explain not only the GI, but also systemic disturbances in COVID-19. Amino acid supplements could be recommended. Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e	Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome containing a single open reading frame flanked by the 59-and 39-noncoding regions (NCRs). The virus genome replicates via a negative-sense RNA intermediate. The NCRs and their complementary sequences in the negative-sense RNA are the sites for assembly of the RNA replicase complex thereby regulating the RNA synthesis and virus replication. In this study, we show that the 55-kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts in vitro with both the 59-NCR of the positive-sense genomic RNA -5NCR(+), and its complementary sequence in the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA -3NCR(-). The interaction of viral RNA with PTB was validated in infected cells by JEV RNA co-immunoprecipitation and JEV RNA-PTB colocalization experiments. Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation-coupled translocation of nuclear PTB to cytoplasmic foci that colocalized with JEV RNA early during JEV infection. Our studies employing the PTB silencing and over-expression in cultured cells established an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication. Using RNA-protein binding assay we show that PTB competitively inhibits association of JEV 3NCR(-) RNA with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5 protein), an event required for the synthesis of the plussense genomic RNA. cAMP is known to promote the Protein kinase A (PKA)mediated PTB phosphorylation. We show that cells treated with a cAMP analogue had an enhanced level of phosphorylated PTB in the cytoplasm and a significantly suppressed JEV replication. Data presented here show a novel, cAMP-induced, OPEN ACCESS Cells infected with JEV at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and collected in 500 ml cell lysis buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mg/ml aprotinin and 0.5% PTB-Mediated Inhibition of JEV Replication PLOS ONE |
27df1fc2fa0fab2bd274ee77148eaadcb6b513db	The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has caused a high number of deaths in the world. To combat it, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells. Infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell-surface glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides. In this study, we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV to these glycans. Our results revealed that the S proteins and subunits can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner, the length of HS is not a critical factor for the binding, and no binding with sialic acid residues was detected. Overall, this work suggests that HS binding may be a general mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells, and supports the potential importance of HS in infection and in the development of antiviral agents against these viruses.

It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the SIR model; the SIS model; and the Ross-Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model's results, finding that in all cases there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of R 0 while the other produces nonsensical results. Mathematical modeling | Infectious disease dynamics | Human population movement | Malaria DT Citron developed the project and carried out the analysis. DL Smith provided guidance and context for the project. CA Guerra provided the data for building the Bioko Island model.

49f7f726a602a3e20d2525a7b696fd4a41d8430c	To date real-time quantitative PCR and gene expression microarrays are the methods of choice for quantification of nucleic acids. Herein, we described a unique fluorescence resonance energy transferbased microarray platform for real-time quantification of nucleic acid targets that combines advantages of both and reduces their limitations. A set of 3 0 amino-modified TaqMan probes were designed and immobilized on a glass slide composing a regular microarray pattern, and used as probes in the consecutive PCR carried out on the surface. During the extension step of the PCR, 5 0 nuclease activity of DNA polymerase will cleave quencher dyes of the immobilized probe in the presence of nucleic acids targets. The increase of fluorescence intensities generated by the change in physical distance between reporter fluorophore and quencher moiety of the probes were collected by a confocal scanner. Using this new approach we successfully monitored five different pathogenic genomic DNAs and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of fluorescence intensity changes on the TaqMan probe array. The results indicate that the TaqMan probe array on a planar glass slide monitors DNA targets with excellent specificity as well as high sensitivity. This set-up offers the great advantage of real-time quantitative detection of DNA targets in a parallel array format.

Tonsillar swabs and serum were obtained from dogs on entry into the kennels and in regular intervals thereafter. Additional samples were collected during outbreaks of CIRD. The swabs were examined by virus culture and PCR for canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus, canine herpesvirus (CHV) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV). Furthermore the prevalence of antibodies to CHV and CRCoV was determined. During this study CIRD was reported mainly in one of the two kennels investigated. In that kennel antibody responses to CRCoV indicated a seasonal occurrence of the virus, which coincided with two outbreaks of respiratory disease. CHV antibody responses were detected throughout the year. In the other kennel, which reported few cases of CIRD a high prevalence of antibodies to CRCoV was detected on entry but only sporadic seroconversions to CRCoV or CHV. By PCR three dogs were found positive for CRCoV in one kennel whereas all PCR tests for other viruses were negative for both kennels. Virus culture failed to detect any viruses in either kennel. 1494 K. Erles and J. Brownlie
79c4811b21faeb3898ddcc74a9872ee0e6d4637e	Dear Editor, the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in healthcare systems responding to rapidly rising demand. Simultaneously, increased infection prevention measures for staff, which includes additional personal protective equipment (PPE) and more rigorous hand hygiene procedures, has resulted in an increased incidence of occupational skin disease in frontline staff (1). From April to June 2020, self-referral occupational dermatology "drop-in" and virtual clinics were established at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT) and Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (SRFT) to support frontline staff. We describe our patient cohorts, delineate the commonly seen diagnoses and offer practical management advice. Questionnaires were completed for each consultation, with 167 consultations (146 staff, average age 35.7 years, range 23-69) at GSTT and 92 (85 staff; average age 39.5 years, range 24-59) at SRFT. Overwhelmingly, staff were female (85.1% at GSTT, 87% SRFT), reflecting the workforce demographic (table 1.) Occupational hand dermatitis is well recognised in healthcare workers. Lan et al. reported occurrence in 74.5% of 526 staff in Hubei province, China (1). Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) was present in 97.1% of staff with hand dermatitis at GSTT and 75.9% at SRFT, reinforcing the importance of preventative strategies for 'frontline' workers. Within our trusts an information leaflet was publicised in trust briefings and on intranets. Moisturisers were made freely available to all staff. This is particularly important as soap Accepted Article cohort, although 6/15 staff tested to date had potentially relevant contact allergies. Chemical ICD was seen at GSTT following introduction of reusable masks with advice to sanitise using Clinell TM wipes and leave to dry. Build-up of antimicrobial agents, including benzalkonium chloride, a nonvolatile surfactant known to be irritant (8), led to eczema at contact points from the masks. Rinsing with tap water (approved by Infection Control) after use of Clinell TM wipes resulted in resolution. Staff should wear gloves when handling such wipes. Occupational dermatoses have been the epidemic within the Covid-19 pandemic. Robust risk assessment and appropriate preventative strategies need to be implemented within the NHS. Staff occupational dermatology clinics appear effective in ensuring wellbeing of frontline staff as we move forward in the 'new normal'.
1c13866210926de8bb677b87457e8c0329553729	By applying engineering principles to biology, synthetic biology has become the science of reassembling catalogued and standardized biological components in a systematic and rational manner to create and engineer functional biological designer devices, systems and organisms with predictable, useful and novel functions. Synthetic biology is able to use an inventory of biomolecular parts compiled over 50 years of molecular biological and functional genomic research 1-4 , as well as technology that has made it possible to analyse 5,6 , synthesize 7-9 , assemble 10 , modify 11 and transfer 12,13 genetic components into living organisms. Although it has recently become possible to reconstruct a living organism after transfer of a synthetic genome that has been assembled from chemically synthesized nucleic acid pieces 13,14 , the rational design of state-of-the-art biological circuits with predicable functions remains challenging and is apparently limited to a handful genes 15-31 . Synthetic circuitry is composed of basic heterologous control components that fine-tune transgene expression in response to specific exogenous cues or endogenous metabolites 32 . These gene switches include triggerinducible protein-DNA 33-36 or aptamer-transcript interactions 37-39 , which control transcription and translation in response to heterologous and endogenous input signals (FIG. 1) . The standardized design of gene switches has improved functional compatibility 40,41 and has enabled the construction of higher-order networks -including multi-trigger inputs and sequential control 42,43 , mutual control 20,23,44,45 and feedback control 16, 19, 28, 46 of circuit components -that are able to provide complex protein expression dynamics with high precision and predictable logic in response to external cues or physiological pathways. Because most control components function in different bacterial and eukaryotic species after minor refinements 36,47-49 , gene switches and network blueprints that were pioneered in bacteria or yeast are often fully functional in mammalian cells. Examples of synthetic networks with similar components and circuit topology in bacterial and mammalian cells include: regulatory cascades 42,43 , epigenetic toggle switches 15,20,23,45 , hysteretic circuits 22,50,51 , molecular timing devices 30,52 , synthetic eco-sensing systems, synthetic quorumsensing systems, synthetic hormone systems 46,53,54 , bandpass filters 21,30,55 and different types of oscillators that program rhythmic transgene expression with a tunable frequency and amplitude 16, [26] [27] [28] [29] 56, 57 . Most of these first-generation synthetic circuits operated in isolation without any interface with the metabolism of the host cell, and they were used to program specific cellular functions using heterologous external input signals [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Key challenges that often occur in the biomedical setting are the need for drug-target specificity, precise drug-dosing regimes, minimizing side effects, shortening the diagnosis-to-treatment timelines and avoiding drug-resistance of pathogens. As synthetic biology enables the engineering of complex, high-precision control devices that couple sensing and delivery mechanisms, this emerging science may be able to offer tools that are suited to meeting current biomedical challenges in new ways.

aec3a6af07521ba3bc60e74f3efe4d86cf0ac616	KEYWORDS Food safety Contamination Technology Trade Travel Foodborne illness has undoubtedly plagued humans from the beginning, as long as we have existed. The transition from hunter-gathering societies to settlements with agriculture and domesticated animals improved food security but increased the need for food safety and the opportunities for foodborne illnesses. Technology, from simple systems for sanitary disposal of human and animal waste, protection of water from fecal contamination, refrigeration, freezing, and other methods to inhibit microbial growth in food, for example pasteurization of milk, has contributed to the safety of the food supply chain and the reduction in foodborne illness. The globalization and increased magnitude of transport of food across the world, partly in response to the growth in population and in part to changes in the way that people obtain, prepare, and consume food, provides new ways for pathogens to be transported and transmitted. In addition to travel of the food supply, travel of people may expose them to foodborne illness to which they would not otherwise be exposed. Factory farming, the large-scale growth and processing especially of food animals, can easily promote unhygienic conditions and contamination in unprecedented scale of food products with pathogens, toxins, antibiotics, and other potentially dangerous substances. The scale of these factors has diminished the ability of regulatory agencies to monitor the safety of the products being consumed on a daily basis. Nonetheless, there are many opportunities to improve both technology and practice and, in turn, help to prevent or reduce future disease incidence. Infect Dis Clin N Am 27 (2013) 501-515 http://dx.
5aa7bb757f909abc71347a4add89dcdde3f9b7b1	Background: Destruction of the architectural and subsequently the functional integrity of the lung following pulmonary viral infections is attributable to both the extent of pathogen replication and to the host-generated inflammation associated with the recruitment of immune responses. The presence of antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence of novel viruses assures the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection. Thus, there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune responses in the lung but which limits immune-mediated lung damage. The immunoprophylactic strategy described here utilizes a protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary infection and also results in a host immune response that causes less lung damage. Methodology/Principal Findings: Mice pre-treated with PCN, independent of any specific viral antigens, were protected against both sub-lethal and lethal doses of two different influenza viruses, a mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus, or mouse pneumovirus. Treatment with PCN significantly increased survival and was marked by enhanced viral clearance, accelerated induction of viral-specific antibody production, and significant decreases in morbidity and lung damage. The enhanced protection appears to be dependent upon the prior development of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the lung in response to the PCN treatment and to be mediated through CD4+ T cell and B cell dependent mechanisms. Conclusions/Significance: The immunoprophylactic strategy described utilizes an infection-independent induction of naturally occurring iBALT prior to infection by a pulmonary viral pathogen. This strategy non-specifically enhances primary immunity to respiratory viruses and is not restricted by the antigen specificities inherent in typical vaccination strategies. PCN treatment is asymptomatic in its application and importantly, ameliorates the damaging inflammation normally associated with the recruitment of immune responses into the lung.

d8f3eb2d0c5bb4768c2f6f440a11cbeabdde07c5	The global spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is overwhelming many health-care systems. As a result, epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic. We note that the majority of existing models do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals (i.e. the underlying human interaction network). Using network science we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies. Although applicable to disease modelling in general, our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current COVID-19 epidemiological models. We provide commented source code for all our analyses so that they can easily be integrated into current and future epidemiological models.
eb133d6301554c7c8715363002f304e6ee08301d	The lung plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis, as it is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonary homeostasis is maintained by a network of tissue-resident cells, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells and leukocytes. Myeloid cells of the innate immune system and epithelial cells form a critical barrier in the lung. Recently developed unbiased next generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed cell heterogeneity in the lung with respect to physiology and pathology and has reshaped our knowledge. New phenotypes and distinct gene signatures have been identified, and these new findings enhance the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases. Here, we present a review of the new NGS findings on myeloid cells in lung development, homeostasis, and lung diseases, including acute lung injury (ALI), lung fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer.
2bc32d5df1c0d8656799d0cc8355be8b5aa4aa0d	Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) preparations in allogeneic stem cell transplantation are used in various conditioning regimens both to prevent graft rejection and reduce the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease. Tecelac (RATG) is a highly purified ATG preparation with high specific activity. The high specific antibody content implies the need for lower doses, with reduced side-effects in comparison to other ATGs. Here, we report on the first 10 patients worldwide who received RATG as part of conditioning. Patients were heterogeneous with regard to diagnoses and graft characteristics. RATG was given in cases of matched unrelated donors, mismatched family donors, reduced conditioning, or high risk for graft failure. Mostly mild allergic reactions toward RATG were seen. All of the patients engrafted in due time. Two died within 2 months of transplant of pulmonary complications not related to RATG. Two developed GVHD grade I, no chronic GVHD was seen to date. Viremia occurred in two, with no viral disease developed. Of the eight patients surviving, one suffered relapse of acute leukemia, one shows impending graft failure. The others are well. Using RATG in conditioning is feasible. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002) 29, 957-962.
17dba3d819679a6a4d8118ec3bf0c49fc53ed4a3	The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica)
3769fc772f7e3fb0d0822bb2887ae12c0dbaf0d2	Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a major cause of morbidity in the recipients of organ transplants and in the congenitally infected infants. HCMV vaccine has emerged as an effective approach to prevent HCMV infection particularly for the development of multiple viral antigens vaccination and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted polyepitope technology. As the Chinese population makes up more than one fifth of the population worldwide, it is important to develop HCMV vaccines more specific for the Chinese population by targeting Chinese-restricted HLA alleles and antigens. In the present study, we designed a novel chimeric polyepitope vaccine based on the replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5F35, which encodes 83 HCMV T cell epitopes from 15 different HCMV antigens, restricted to 14 HLA I and 7 HLA II alleles that cover 92% of the Chinese population. Our results show that the recombinant adenovirus vaccine Ad5F35-CTLÁTh can be efficiently transfected and expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with little cytopathic activity. Ad5F35-CTLÁTh can also be endogenously processed and presented by PBMCs. Ad5F35-CTLÁTh-stimulated HCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) showed strong cytolytic activity against HCMV polyepitope-sensitized target cells. The CTL activity was accompanied by high levels of IFN-c production after Ad5F35-CTLÁTh stimulation. The specificity and vigorous response to the recombinant adenovirus vaccine in vitro makes it a potential candidate to be used for transplantation recipients or congenitally infected infants.
d7c1bff961955e099a23dd51fd2a7734069bd942	To characterize genetic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmitted in the Beijing area during the epidemic outbreak of 2003, we sequenced 29 full-length S genes of SARS-CoV from 20 hospitalized SARS patients on our unit, the Beijing 302 Hospital. Viral RNA templates for the S-gene amplification were directly extracted from raw clinical samples, including plasma, throat swab, sputum, and stool, during the course of the epidemic in the Beijing area. We used a TAcloning assay with direct analysis of nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products in sequence. One hundred thirteen sequence variations with nine recurrent variant sites were identified in analyzed S-gene sequences compared with the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV. Among them, eight variant sites were, we think, the first documented. Our findings demonstrate the coexistence of Sgene sequences with and without substitutions (compared to BJ01) in samples analyzed from some patients. a The results were determined by analysis of cloned sequences; + represents that nucleotide substitution at the variant site is detected and -represents that the nucleotide at the site is identical to the one of BJ01 reference sequence in all analyzed sequences. b SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SW, throat swab; PL, plasma; SP, sputum; ST, stool. c The numbers represent the ratio of reference to variant nucleotide detected at the site from the analyzed cloned sequences.
c6352a4a0baa6c740809264b8deb2a48015e98ec	The population of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) is decreasing all over Germany since the years 2008/2009. Besides impacts of habitat changes caused by current rates of land conversion, climatic influences or predators, a contribution of infectious pathogens needs also to be considered. Infectious and non-infectious diseases in free-living populations of ringnecked pheasants have been scarcely investigated so far. In the present study, carcasses of 258 deceased free-ranging pheasants of different age groups, predominantly adult pheasants, collected over a period of 4 years in the states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, were examined pathomorphologically, parasitologically, virologically and bacteriologically, with a focus set on infectious pathogens. A periocular and perinasal dermatitis of unknown origin was present in 62.3% of the pheasants. Additional alterations included protozoal cysts in the skeletal musculature (19.0%), hepatitis (21.7%), enteritis (18.7%), gastritis (12.6%), and pneumonia (11.7%). In single cases, neoplasms (2.6%) and mycobacteriosis (1.7%) occurred. Further findings included identification of coronaviral DNA from trachea or caecal tonsils (16.8%), siadenoviral DNA (7.6%), avian metapneumoviral RNA (6.6%), and infectious bursal disease viral RNA (3.7%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on herpesvirus, avian influenza virus (AIV), paramyxovirus type 1 (PMV-1), avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), and chlamydia were negative. Based on the present results, there is no indication of a specific pathogen as a sole cause for population decline in adult pheasants. However, an infectious disease can still not be completely excluded as it may only affect reproduction effectivity or a certain age group of pheasants (e.g., chicks) which were not presented in the study.

The order of unfolding of the 10 helices in Mpro is characterized by beta vs alpha plots similar to those of cytochromes and globins. The longest turning region is anomalous in the earliest stage of unfolding. In an investigation of excluded-volume effects, we found that the maximum spread in average molecular-volume values for Mpro, cytochrome c-b 562 , cytochrome c', myoglobin, and cytoglobin is ~ 10 Å 3 . This apparent universality is a consequence dominant contributions from six residues: ALA, ASP, GLU, LEU, LYS and VAL. Of the seven Mpro histidines, residues 41, 163, 164, and 246 are in stable H-bonded regions; metal ion binding to one or more of these residues could break up the H-bond network, thereby affecting protease function. Our analysis also indicated that metal binding to cysteine residues 44 and 145 could disable the enzyme. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
d91945059aead8e37cbc30c77f6db8539ee2a8ef	In March 2020, the Austrian government introduced a widespread lock-down in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on subjective impressions and anecdotal evidence, Austrian public and private life came to a sudden halt. Here we assess the effect of the lock-down quantitatively for all regions in Austria and present an analysis of daily changes of human mobility throughout Austria using near-real-time anonymized mobile phone data. We describe an efficient data aggregation pipeline and analyze the mobility by quantifying mobile-phone traffic at specific point of interests (POIs), analyzing individual trajectories and investigating the cluster structure of the origin-destination graph. We found a reduction of commuters at Viennese metro stations of over 80% and the number of devices with a radius of gyration of less than 500 m almost doubled. The results of studying crowd-movement behavior highlight considerable changes in the structure of mobility networks, revealed by a higher modularity and an increase from 12 to 20 detected communities. We demonstrate the relevance of mobility data for epidemiological studies by showing a significant correlation of the outflow from the town of Ischgl (an early COVID-19 hotspot) and the reported COVID-19 cases with an 8-day time lag. This research indicates that mobile phone usage data permits the moment-by-moment quantification of mobility behavior for a whole country. We emphasize the need to improve the availability of such data in anonymized form to empower rapid response to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics.
2ee599843953907bbc6eb24968497ed8b26dd0f8	Background: The online teaching demand has increased tremendously to promote the implementation of online teaching-leaning system to meet the need of students during the outbreaks of emerging infectious disease. This study aims to explore whether the pandemic of COVID-19, which requires universities to rapidly offer online learning, will affect attitudes about online education for undergraduate health sciences students. Also, it investigates the barriers for using online tools. Method: A cross-sectional survey using online social media was used to recruit eligible participants. The data for this study were focused on students' experiences utilizing an online education method offered by the Jordanian government universities. This study is utilizing newly developed measuring tools that are expected to enable students to evaluate online teaching in terms of their own learning progress. Results: A total of 1,210 participants agreed to complete the online survey questionnaire. The mean score preparedness and attitude toward online education was average. The majority of students agreed that online courses helped assign reading and homework time better than on-campus approach (75.0%) and felt comfortable to actively communicate with my classmates and instructors online. Zoom and eLearning were the most common online platforms utilized by students. The geographic locations, lack of past experience on using online tools, and lack of past experience on using online tools were identi ed by students as the main barrier to online educations. Conclusions: Although the pandemic of COVID-19 appeared as uncommon catalyst for promoting eLearning, further research is needed to assess whether learners are ready and willing to make greater use of online education to obtain high quality teaching and learning opportunities, which could totally change educators' and students' attitudes and impression, and subsequently the general themes of online education.
af9ee6417afa77221185790b082abea1bfd90e76	Objective: Retrospectively analyze the clinical data of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and explore the value of serum phosphorus level in evaluating the severity and prognosis of the disease. Methods: COVID-19 patients transferred from the first emergency ward of Taiyuan fourth people's Hospital from February 8 to March 3, 2020 were enrolled. The information of general conditions, clinical manifestations, laboratory indexes, nucleic acid detection and treatment were collected. The changes of blood phosphorus level and absolute value of lymphocytes in ordinary and severe/critical patients were recorded and compared. Results: A total of 32 patients with COVID-19 were collected, including 12 cases of common type and 20 cases of severe/critical type. Before treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups were significantly lower than the normal level, and the serum phosphorus levels of the severe/critical patients were lower than those of the common type patients (t = 2.767, P < 0.010). After treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups reached normal, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (t = 0.231, P > 0.819). The level of lymphocytes in severe/critical patients was lower than that in normal patients (t = 4.636, P < 0.001) before treatment. After treatment, the absolute value of lymphocytes in the two groups reached normal, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (t=1.208，P=0.237). There was a positive correlation between lymphocytes and serum phosphorus, and the correlation coefficient was 0.479. Conclusion: hypophosphatemia is related to the severity of COVID-19, and strengthening the monitoring of serum phosphorus level of COVID-19's severe/critical patients and correcting hypophosphatemia in time are of significance to improve the prognosis.
30f9f8dd4536eea9368e9214f216cf40917eddb5	Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children aged 1-59 months worldwide [1] . WHO recommends providing low flow oxygen by nasal cannula in pediatric patients with oxygen saturation < 90% [2] . With the provision of oxygen supplementation, some children still require further respiratory support such as mechanical ventilation due to the failure to maintain oxygen saturation and severe respiratory distress [3, 4] . However, mechanical ventilation may result in ventilator-induced lung injury [5] . As a simple and minimally invasive technique, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been used in children with severe pneumonia [6, 7] , but its effect and safety are uncertain. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis that compared CPAP with standard therapy or low-flow oxygen to figure out the effects and safety of CPAP. This meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines [8] . The present meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020136450). The literature search was carried out in Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science from inception until February 12, 2020 and the search was restricted to articles published in English. The search terms and keywords were provided in Table S1 in the supplement. Inclusion criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and crossover studies; (2) having a comparison group (standard therapy or low-flow oxygen); and (3) involving inpatients with severe pneumonia defined by WHO younger than 18 years. Case reports, observational studies, reviews, comments, conference abstracts were excluded. The primary outcomes were the intubation rate and mortality. Secondary outcomes included the change in respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), duration of hospital stay, and adverse events. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Data extracted included: study design, participants and settings, interventions, outcomes, and adverse effects. Disagreements were solved by consensus. We summarized the intervention effects by calculating risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes; we also calculated 95% confidence interval for each outcome. Fixed-effects model or random-effects model were used to perform meta-analysis depending on the heterogeneity across studies. I 2 statistic were used for the assessment of heterogeneity, with I 2 > 50% indicating significant heterogeneity [9] . To explore the potential causes of significant heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analyses for primary outcomes if data were sufficient. The factors including age, sample size, settings, and high-risk conditions were prespecified for subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by removing crossover trails and those studies without the supervision of physicians respectively. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Four studies (three RCTs [10-12], one randomized crossover trial [13] ) with a total of 3040 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Descriptive data for each study are presented in Table 1 . Three studies [11-13] (n = 2971) investigated the mortality. The pooled data suggested that mortality was not significantly reduced in CPAP group with significant heterogeneity (RR: 0.75, 95%CI = 0.33, 1.73; P = 0.50, I 2 = 83%) (Fig. 1a) . The probability of intubation was reported in only one RCT [11] (n = 146), in which a trend towards reduction in intubation was found in the CPAP group, but the Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https ://doi.org/10.
d8a6ceb412593e209b235ebe112df929d2721e76	SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for human cases of COVID-19, a pandemic with global impact that first emerged in late 2019. Since then, the viral genome has shown considerable variance as the disease spread across the world, in part due to the zoonotic origins of the virus and the human host adaptation process. As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, 8, and 12, which form the core polymerase complex. We propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains.
d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease with significant morbidity and mortality. While its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. Other organs affected include the kidneys, brain, digestive tract, heart, liver, thyroid gland and urogenital tract. The primary target cells are pneumocytes and enterocytes, both cell types abundantly expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is the main SARS-CoV receptor. Other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons, and immune cells. The pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus. Indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In this review, we summarize the major pathological findings at the gross, cellular and molecular levels and discuss the various possible mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS. The implications of the proposed pathogenesis for prevention, diagnosis and therapy of the disease are discussed.

4720796b3523b3d81e0056372b985c061e77cda1	COVID-19 is frequently associated with severe systemic consequences, including vasculitis, a hyperinflammatory state and hypercoagulation. The mechanisms leading to these life-threatening abnormalities are multifactorial. Based on the analysis of publicly available interactomes, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 infection directly causes a deficiency in C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), a pathogen-specific mechanism that may help explain significant systemic abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Severe manifestations of COVID-19 include acute respiratory distress, cardiovascular affectation, multi-organ involvement 1 and a coagulopathy 2-4 that may be compatible with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 5,6 . The causal mechanisms of the systemic manifestations associated with COVID-19
83da89e0732df8a728760bccb91c894ef2457563	The transmissible nature of communicable diseases is what sets them apart from other diseases modeled by health economists. The probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected at any one point in time (the force of infection) is related to the number of infectious individuals in the population, will change over time, and will feed back into the future force of infection. These nonlinear interactions produce transmission dynamics that require specific consideration when mod-eling an intervention that has an impact on the transmission of a pathogen. Best practices for designing and building these models are set out in this article.
942557ee1d2f2f47dea421b787f9aee2da8ba9e7	Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are important pollutants that affect public health in urban areas, especially in developing and oil-rich countries such as Iran. This assesses the relationship between TPH and PAHs in street dust and suspended dust, and investigates toxicity level in the urban environment of the most important petrochemical center in Iran. For this purpose, 21 and 48 street dust samples were collected for TPH analysis and PAH analysis, respectively, in Asaluyeh County. Moreover, seven air dust samples were taken for PAH analysis. TPH concentrations ranged between 240 and 4400 mg kg −1 , with a mean of 1371.43 mg kg −1 . The maximum ∑PAH concentration (6016.3 mg kg −1 ) was detected in a petrochemical complex while the minimum ∑PAHs content (16.93 mg kg −1 ) was measured in an urban area. The mean concentrations of total PAHs in street dust particles were 491.35 mg kg −1 in summer and 304.04 mg kg −1 in winter. The results indicated that PAH concentration in summer was higher. PAH sources were identified using both PAHs ratios and robust statistical methods such as Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), backward GEE, logistic regression, principal components analysis (PCA) in conjunction with multiple linear regression (MLR) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The results showed that PAH species generally originate from pyrogenic sources and about 0.08% of TPH was typically PAHs. However, petrogenic sources of PAHs in the industrial areas were 11.2 times more abundant than in urban areas. Also, backward GEE model demonstrated that TPH is more influenced by HMW PAHs, particularly indene. Estimated incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was higher than 10 -4 , showing that Asaluyeh inhabitants (especially children and indoor workers) are probably exposed to cancer risk, particularly through dermal contact and dust ingestion.
65e75eee2be655f5569905fc3b98a26e099fc5a6	Due to its noninvasive nature and ease of use, there is cincreasing interest for transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) as a neuromodulation technique. However, like many emerging fields in medical science, tVNS is hampered by a proliferation of small-scale uninformative and underpowered studies. These studies typically report positive effects that remain unreplicated. Another potential point of concern is the device manufacturers' involvement in many of those studies, which further enhances the risk of a systematic bias in the literature (1). A recent case report published in Neuromodulation on effects of cervical tVNS on symptoms of COVID-19 (2) seems exemplary of both concerns, as further explained below. We believe it is important and timely to address these issues.
2000b56ab7a60199d3bbb2148295370ae87b3d58	Case information on the nation, region, date of onset of symptoms/disease, hospitalization, death/survival and time of death were compiled from World Health Organization "situation update" reports. Some or most of these fields are not reported in many of the updates, especially the epidemiologically important dates of onset of symptoms and clinical recovery or death. Figure S1 shows the histogram of the time between onset of symptoms and death for all cases (number of observations n=44) for which this information is available. Note that Figure S1 bears a close resemblance to Supplementary Information Figure 1 of [1] , for the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza (n=94). Also, for these cases, which correspond to hospitalizations in most cases, the mode of the time between onset of symptoms and death is about 9 days. We calculated the average number of cases per week (λ = 0.73) from reported cases, and verified that case introductions of avian influenza, taken as a fixed large fraction of cases, are not well modelled by a homogeneous Poisson process with mean λ ( Figure S2 ). This has important consequences that guided our statistical modeling of introductions. First, we

Such diseases spread mainly through person-to-person contacts. Health care authorities recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast population. Although several mobile applications have been developed to trace contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information such as GPS locations, and the logging of privacy-sensitive data on a third party server, or require additional infrastructure such as WiFi APs with known locations. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, a privacy-oriented mobile contact tracing application that does not rely on GPS or any other form of infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of any other personally identifiable information on a server. The goal of CONTAIN is to allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short distance, specifically, Bluetooth wireless range, of someone that is infected, and potentially also when. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees provided by our approach. Our simulation study utilizing an empirical trace dataset (Asturies) involving 100 mobile devices and around 60000 records shows that users can maximize their possibility of identifying if they were near an infected user by turning on the app during active times. • Security and privacy → Privacy protections; • Information systems → Mobile information processing systems.
28f2f3169e77c805aedcf96c7bc5b4e69ee6d353	COVID-19 challenges the daily function of nearly every institution of society. It is the duty of any society to be responsive to such challenges by relying on the best tools and logic available to analyze the costs and benefits of any mitigative action. We here provide a mathematical model to explore the epidemiological consequences of allowing standard intake and unaltered within-jail operational dynamics to be maintained during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and contrast this with proposed interventions to reduce the burden of negative health outcomes. In this way, we provide estimates of the infection risks, and likely loss of life, that arise from current incarceration practices. We provide estimates for in-custody deaths and show how the within-jail dynamics lead to spill-over risks, not only affecting the incarcerated people, but increasing the exposure, infection, and death rates for both corrections officers with whom they interact within the jail system, and the broader community beyond the justice system. We show that, given a typical jail-community dynamic, operating in a business as usual way will result in significant and rapid loss of life. Large scale reductions in arrest and speeding of releases are likely to save the lives of incarcerated people, staff and the community at large. As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the globe, one of the critical functions of 2 epidemiology is to consider how society can transform current practice to increase the 3 health and safety of the public. The widespread risk of infection and the high case 4 fatality rates, especially in older or medically compromised populations, mean that we, 5 as a society, must be willing to consider structural reforms to our institutions to 6 promote an overall greater good. To these ends, we have already seen systemic shifts in 7 institutional practices that would be unthinkable under normal conditions: 8 , 2020
cee0724d4b1544eda1581f96962694ecd1f0125b	Diammonium glycyrrhizin (DG), a salt from glycyrrhizinate (GL) that is a major active component of licorice root extract with various pharmacological activities was investigated for its inhibitory effect on pseudorabies virus (PrV) infection. In parallel, lithium chloride (LiCl), a chemical reagent with potential antiviral activity was compared with DG for their inhibitory ability against PrV infection in vitro. Virus plaque-reduction assays, PCR and RT-PCR analysis indicated that both drugs inhibited cell infection by PrV. Moreover, addition of the drugs resulted in fewer apoptotic cells during PrV infection.
f7bca2d95e075081f9f1dd6bb22c89b5c8788856	In crisis management, risk management has been conceived mainly as a proactive pre-crisis management effort where it is deployed for crisis prevention and preparedness efforts. This chapter argues that risk management extends into the entire crisis management continuum, as crises ignite new types of risks with their associated stakeholders. Organizations should continually identify, manage and communicate risks to key stakeholders during the different phases of crisis management. A stakeholder orientation demands that organizations seek and involve risk stakeholders in the risk management process. The level of involvement will depend on both the identified risks and how stakeholders are expected to be affected by the proposed solutions and decisionmaking processes.

Thus, 3′-SL was further studied for in vivo study against H9N2 virus in pathogen free chicken experiment models. In vivo study exhibited improved clinical symptoms on H9N2 infected chickens when treated with 3′-SL. Moreover, treating chickens with 3′-SL resulted in complete elimination of H9N2 viruses within 24 h of virus infection (0.8 HAU of H9N2). Indirect ELISA assay confirmed complete wash-out of H9N2 viruses from the colon after neutralization by 3′-SL without entering the blood stream. These in vivo results open up possible applications of 3′-SL for the prevention of AI virus infections in birds by a simple cleansing mechanism.
c38326897d5e6e5b05f71b46f59536bc73ba5446	Impact of air pollution on educational attainment for respiratory health treated students: a cross sectional data linkage study Abstract Introduction There is some evidence that exam results are worse when students are acutely exposed to air pollution. Studies investigating the association between air pollution and academic attainment have been constrained by small sample sizes. Cross sectional educational attainment data (2009 -2015) from students aged 15-16 years in Cardiff, Wales were linked to primary health care data, modelled air pollution and measured pollen data, and analysed using multilevel linear regression models. Annual cohort, school and individual level confounders were adjusted for in single and multipollutant/pollen models. We stratified by treatment of asthma and/or Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR). A unit (10ug/m3) increase of short-term exposure to NO 2 was associated with 0.044 (95% CI: -0.079, -0.008) reduction of standardised Capped Point Score (CPS) after adjusting for individual and household risk factors for 18,241 students. This association remained statistically significant after controlling for other pollutants and pollen. There was no association of PM 2.5 , O 3 , or Pollen with standardised CPS remaining after adjustment. We found no evidence that treatment for asthma or SAR modified the observed NO 2 effect on educational attainment. Our study showed that short-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution, specifically NO 2, was associated with detrimental educational attainment for students aged 15-16. Longitudinal investigations in different settings are required to confirm this possible impact 2 and further work may uncover the long-term economic implications, and degree to which impacts are cumulative and permanent. Air pollution estimates for home and school locations were linked to individual outcomes Short term exposure to NO 2 was associated with lower educational attainment Treatment for asthma or hayfever did not modify the effect of pollution on educational attainment A research agenda using longitudinal population-based data linkage is proposed Health inequality considerations should be included in proposed air quality policies
a524482f81e49994b9e3dc6e77a92906de916838	Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents major challenges to places of detention, including secure forensic hospitals. International guidance presents a range of approaches to assist in decreasing the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks as well as responses to manage outbreaks of infection should they occur. Methods: We conducted a literature search on pandemic or outbreak management in forensic mental health settings, including gray literature sources, from 2000 to April 2020. We describe the evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak in our own facility, and the design, and staffing of a forensic isolation unit. We found a range of useful guidance but no published experience of implementing these approaches. We experienced outbreaks of COVID-19 on two secure forensic units with 13 patients and 10 staff becoming positive. One patient died. The outbreaks lasted for 41 days on each unit from declaration to resolution. We describe the approaches taken to reduction of infection risk, social distancing and changes to the care delivery model. Conclusions: Forensic secure settings present major challenges as some proposals for pandemic management such as decarceration or early release are not possible, and facilities may present challenges to achieve sustained social distancing. Assertive testing, cohorting, and isolation units are appropriate responses to these challenges.

a2dffcab78ea1279969e52a93410e70ef87d3252	Major effort has been spent on improving oxygenation in acute respiratory failure. However death is rarely by hypoxemia but by abdominal organ failure. We have shown that abdominal lymph drainage is impeded with mechanical ventilation [1] and this raises the question whether abdominal edema is increased during mechanical ventilation. Twenty 2-3 months old pigs with a mean weight of 28 kg were studied during anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. A sepsis-like condition was created by continuous infusion of lipopolysacharide, LPS, and the pigs were followed for 6 hours. 99Tc-labelled red blood cells were used as an intra-vascular marker and 111In-labelled transferrin as an intra-and extravascular marker of abdominal fluid as detected by gamma-camera technique. Healthy pigs showed a slight increase in free abdominal fluid over a 6-hour study period. LPS caused a three-to-eight fold increase in the rate of ascites formation and abdominal organ swelling. Mechanical ventilation (MV) with a low level of end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEP of 5 cmH2O) increased abdominal fluid formation by 10% compared to spontaneous breathing (SB). MV with PEEP of 15 cm H2O caused a significant rise by 80% compared to SB (P < 0.01) and also liver swelling. Free fluid estimation correlated to post mortem measurements (p < 0.05). With the double isotope technique, abdominal edema formation can be followed continuously in experimental conditions. Moreover, abdominal edema formation is enhanced by mechanical ventilation and in particular with PEEP. The findings suggest that the most commonly used techniques of improving oxygenation in acute respiratory failure worsen abdominal fluid balance with organ swelling and increased ascites. The consequences of this have to be studied.

3b2a2a17eb789fee6c46ff6cdc7b6e794f7d545c	Backgrounds: Electronic medical records (EMR) form a rich repository of information that could benefit public health. We asked how structured and free-text narrative EMR data should be combined to improve epidemic surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARI). Methods: Eight previously characterized ARI case detection algorithms (CDA) were applied to historical EMR entries to create authentic time series of daily ARI case counts (background). An epidemic model simulated influenza cases (injection). From the time of the injection, cluster-detection statistics were applied daily on paired background+injection (combined) and background-only time series. This cycle was then repeated with the injection shifted to each week of the evaluation year. We computed: a) the time from injection to the first statistical alarm uniquely found in the combined dataset (Detection Delay); b) how often alarms originated in the background-only dataset (false-alarm rate, or FAR); and c) the number of cases found within these false alarms (Caseload). For each CDA, we plotted the Detection Delay as a function of FAR or Caseload, over a broad range of alarm thresholds. Results: CDAs that combined text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes with provider-assigned diagnostic codes in order to maximize the precision rather than the sensitivity of case-detection lowered Detection Delay at any given FAR or Caseload. Conclusion: An empiric approach can guide the integration of EMR data into case-detection methods that improve both the timeliness and efficiency of epidemic detection.
a9e43d14e0bc0645fd38288f7e1fb2323340a09e	Background: Maternal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or reactivation in pregnancy is associated with a myriad of adverse infant outcomes. However, the role of host genetic polymorphisms in modulating maternal CMV status is inconclusive. This study investigated the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in toll-like receptor (TLR) and cytokine genes with maternal plasma CMV DNA status in black Zimbabweans. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 110 women in late gestation who included 36 CMV infected cases and 74 CMV uninfected, age and HIV status matched controls were enrolled. Twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 genes which code for proteins involved in immunity against CMV were genotyped using Iplex GOLD SNP genotyping protocol on the Agena MassARRAY® system. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE and the 'Genetics' and 'SNPassoc' packages of the statistical package R. Results: The TLR7 rs179008A > T (p < 0.001) polymorphism was associated while the TLR9 rs352139T > C (p = 0.049) polymorphism was on the borderline for association with CMV positive (CMV+) status. In contrast, the interleukin (IL)-6 rs10499563T > C (p < 0.001) and TLR2 rs1816702C > T (p = 0.001) polymorphisms were associated with CMV negative (CMV-) status. Furthermore, allele frequencies of SNPs in TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, TLR7, IL-6, IL-10, IL-28B, IL-1A and interferon AR1 (IFNAR1) genes are being reported here for the first time in a Zimbabwean population. The allele frequencies in the Zimbabwean population are generally comparable to other African populations but different when compared to European and Asian populations. Conclusions: Toll-like receptor and interleukin genetic polymorphisms influence CMV status in late gestation among black Zimbabweans. This is attributable to possible modulation of immune responses to CMV reactivation in a population previously exposed to CMV infection.
693510044da042091162a71507aae3e3da3b231a	The cytopathic effects of Zika virus (ZIKV) are poorly characterized. Innate immunity controls ZIKV infection and disease in most infected patients through mechanisms that remain to be understood. Here, we studied the morphological cellular changes induced by ZIKV and addressed the role of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM), a family of broad-spectrum antiviral factors, during viral replication. We report that ZIKV induces massive vacuolization followed by "implosive" cell death in human epithelial cells, primary skin fibroblasts and astrocytes, a phenomenon which is exacerbated when IFITM3 levels are low. It is reminiscent of paraptosis, a caspase-independent, non-apoptotic form of cell death associated with the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles. We further show that ZIKV-induced vacuoles are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and dependent on the PI3K/Akt signaling axis. Inhibiting the Sec61 ER translocon in ZIKV-infected cells blocked vacuole formation and viral production. Our results provide mechanistic insight behind the ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect and indicate that IFITM3, by acting as a gatekeeper for incoming virus, restricts virus takeover of the ER and subsequent cell death.
23fa4477a0f945ac46e749d9efa1396d34a6f963	The exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date. The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behaviour, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof route transmitted respiratory infection. The following transmission routes are considered: long-range airborne transmission, short-range airborne transmission, direction inhalation of medium droplets or droplet nuclei, direct deposition of droplets of all sizes, direct and indirect contact route. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include the dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines pathogen content in droplets, exposure distance, and pathogen dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provided a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the probability of respiratory diseases transmission via different routes. It also established a basis for predicting the impact of individual-level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.

170fc4f86244f8f795de48b349db6759add5a834	Purpose: Emerging infectious diseases are considered as a pressing challenge to global public health. Throughout public health response to emerging infectious diseases, emergency nurses are situated at the forefront of the healthcare system. The present study has explored emergency nurses' perceptions regarding the risks appraisal of the threat of the emerging infectious disease situation in emergency department context. Methods: The present study used a qualitative descriptive approach. A purposive sampling method was employed to recruit emergency nurses who worked in public hospitals in Hong Kong. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to 24 emergency nurses. The data were interpreted using a thematic analysis strategy. Results: Five overarching themes emerged from the data: (1) the novelty of an emerging infectious disease, (2) the severity of an emerging infectious disease, (3) the proximity to an emerging infectious disease, (4) the complexity of an emerging infectious disease situation, and (5) the response levels towards an emerging infectious disease situation. Conclusion: It is anticipated that the information may help to predict the attitudes and behaviours of emergency nurses in future impending epidemic events, enhancing emergency nurses' preparedness towards in such situations.
ec2a4724c05b21de8c18117b9d99a6afdf9a0908	Background Social distancing-when people limit close contact with others outside their household-is a primary intervention available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of social distancing is unlikely to change until effective treatments or vaccines become widely available. However, relatively little is known about how best to promote social distancing. Applying knowledge from social and behavioral research on conventional health behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity) to support public health efforts and research on social distancing is promising, but empirical evidence supporting this approach is needed. Purpose We examined whether one type of social distancing behavior-reduced movement outside the homewas associated with conventional health behaviors. Method We examined the association between GPSderived movement behavior in 2,858 counties in USA from March 1 to April 7, 2020 and the prevalence of county-level indicators influenced by residents' conventional health behaviors. Results Changes in movement were associated with conventional health behaviors, and the magnitude of these associations were similar to the associations among the conventional health behaviors. Counties with healthier behaviors-particularly less obesity and greater physical activity-evidenced greater reduction in movement outside the home during the initial phases of the pandemic in the USA. Conclusions Social distancing, in the form of reduced movement outside the home, is associated with conventional health behaviors. Existing scientific literature on health behavior and health behavior change can be more confidently used to promote social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.
3be0f1df3128b8596f72524dcc4fb0d061a7c701	Background Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is the most common bariatric surgical procedure worldwide. Educational videos of LSGs are available from online sources with YouTube® being the most popular online video repository. However, due to the unrestricted and uncontrolled nature of YouTube®, anyone can upload videos without peer review or standardization. The LAP-VEGaS guidelines were formed to guide the production of high-quality surgical videos. The aim of this study is to use the LAP-VEGaS guidelines to determine if videos of LSGs available on Youtube® are of an acceptable standard for surgical educational purposes. Methods A YouTube® search was performed using the term laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Appropriate videos were analysed by two individuals using the sixteen LAP-VEGaS guidelines. Results A total of 575 videos were found, of which 202 videos were included and analysed using the LAP-VEGaS guidelines. The median video guideline score was 6/16 with 89% of videos meeting less than half of all guidelines. There was no correlation between the LAP-VEGaS score and view count. Conclusions There is an abundance of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy educational videos available on YouTube®; however, when analysed using the LAP-VEGaS guidelines, the majority do not meet acceptable educational standards for surgical training purposes.
561211ed199b50721dd36afce10acd2ded4f3f0e	Persistence is a crucial trait for learners. However, a common issue in mastery learning is that persistence is not always productive, a construct termed wheel-spinning. In this paper, we extend on prior work to develop wheel-spinning detectors in the ASSISTments learning system that distinguish between non-persistence, productive persistence and wheel-spinning. To understand how quickly we can detect each state, we use data from different numbers of practice opportunities and compare model performance across student-problem set pairs. We identify that a model constructed using data from the first nine practice opportunities outperforms models using less practice data. However, it is possible to differentiate students who will eventually wheel-spin from learners who will persist productively using data from only the first three opportunities. Wheel-spinning can be differentiated from non-persistence from the first five opportunities, and non-persistence can be differentiated from productive persistence from the first seven opportunities. These results show that early differentiation between wheel-spinning and productive persistence is feasible. These detectors relied upon hint requests, the correctness of prior opportunities, and the amount of practice and time on the skill. Identifying predictive features offer insights into the impact of in-system behaviors on wheel-spinning and guide the system design.

12bc88e7428c240181f181ca0358dac85ae16289	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, and CD4 + T cells form the core immunopathogenic cascade leading to chronic inflammation. Traditionally, Th1 cells (interferon-γ-producing CD4 + T cells) driven by interleukin 12 (IL12) were considered to be the encephalitogenic T cells in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Currently, Th17 cells (Il17-producing CD4 + T cells) are considered to play a fundamental role in the immunopathogenesis of EAE. This paper highlights the growing evidence that Th17 cells play the core role in the complex adaptive immunity of EAE/MS and discusses the roles of the associated immune cells and cytokines. These constitute the modern immunological basis for the development of novel clinical and preclinical immunomodulatory therapies for MS discussed in this paper.
52b8e012ccee7d546617d7642d9f232bccfb49fe	Background: Live poultry traders (LPTs) have greater risk to avian influenza due to occupational exposure to poultry. This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and practices of LPTs relating to influenza A (H7N9). Methods: Using multi-stage cluster sampling, 306 LPTs were interviewed in Guangzhou by a standardized questionnaire between mid-May to June, 2013. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with preventive practices and attitudes towards various control measures implemented in live poultry markets against H7N9. Results: Only 46.1% of the respondents recognized risks associated with contacts with bird secretions or droppings, and only 22.9% perceived personally "likely/very likely" to contract H7N9 infection. Around 60% of the respondents complied with hand-washing and wearing gloves, and only 20% reported wearing face masks. Only 16.3% of the respondents agreed on introducing central slaughtering of poultry. Being younger, involving in slaughtering poultry, having longer working hours, less access to H7N9-related information and poorer knowledge, and perceiving lower personal susceptibility to H7N9 infection were negatively associated with preventive practices.
f95dff44aae700378dd3746ea194c9a31a7b15b8	Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62e71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05e0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.
66ffa4cc6c425005054eea58142f7b23307025ef	The gut microbiome is closely associated with the health of the host; although the interaction between the bacterial microbiome and the whole virome has rarely been studied, it is likely of medical importance. Examination of the interactions between the gut bacterial microbiome and virome of rhesus monkey would significantly contribute to revealing the gut microbiome composition. Methods: Here, we conducted a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome of rhesus monkeys in a longitudinal cohort treated with an antibiotic cocktail, and we documented the interactions between the bacterial microbiome and virome. The depletion of viral populations was confirmed at the species level by real-time PCR. We also detected changes in the gut metabolome by GC-MS and LC-MS. Results: A majority of bacteria were depleted after treatment with antibiotics, and the Shannon diversity index decreased from 2.95 to 0.22. Furthermore, the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) decreased from 104.47 to 33.84, and the abundance of eukaryotic viruses also changed substantially. In the annotation, 6 families of DNA viruses and 1 bacteriophage family were present in the normal monkeys but absent after gut bacterial microbiome depletion. Intriguingly, we discovered that changes in the gut bacterial microbiome composition may promote changes in the gut virome composition, and tryptophan, arginine, and quinone may play roles in the interaction between the bacterial microbiome and virome. Conclusion: Our results indicated that the clearly altered composition of the virome was correlated with depletion in the bacterial community and that metabolites produced by bacteria possibly play important roles in the interaction.
9009d8a11e9ce2bca8be3b45eed647fa89c1f131	Background: Guidance aiming at limiting the entry and spread of the COVID-19 have been widely communicated to Long-term Care Facilities (LTCFs). However, no clinical research has investigated their relevance. Objective: Our objective was to compare the guidance applied for the prevention of the COVID-19 epidemic between the LTCFs having been contaminated by COVID-19 and LTCFs having not been contaminated. Methods: A questionnaire was sent and systematically accompanied by phone call to the 132 LTCFs of Haute-Garonne (Occitania region, South-West of France). The questionnaire focused on the preventive measures implemented before March 23, 2020 (first LTCFs contaminated in this area). The questionnaire focused on physician support, implementation of usual guidance (eg, masks, hydro-alcoholic solute used), training on hygiene, containment in residents' rooms and other distancing measures, use of temporary workers, compartmentalization within zones of residents and staff and a self-assessment analogic scale on the quality of the application of the preventive measures. We compared implementation of the guidance between the LTCFs with at least one case of COVID-19 among residents and/or health care professionals and LTCFs without COVID-19 case (between March 23rd and May 6th). Results: 124 LTCFs participated (93.9%). 30 LTCFs (24.19%) were contaminated with COVID-19. Large heterogeneity of the application of the guidance was observed. Public LTCFs (OR= 0.39 (0.20-0.73), LTCFs which organized staff compartmentalization within zones (OR= 0.19 (0.07-0.48)), and LTCF with a staff who self-assessed a higher quality implementation of the preventive measures (OR= 0.65 (0.43-0.98)) were significantly more likely to avoid contamination by the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusion: Our study supports the relevance of guidance to prevent the entry of COVID-19, in particular the staff compartmentalization within zones, as well as the perception of the staff regarding the quality of implementation of those measures in LTCFs.
17ff38a459cd10ecca962dccb5bc6d7bafdb8a4d	Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, a pandemic in March 2020. Given the severity of COVID-19, appropriate use criteria have been implemented for fetal echocardiography. Screening low risk pregnancies for critical congenital heart disease has typically been a shared responsibility by pediatric cardiologists, obstetricians, and maternal fetal medicine (MFM). Currently, many of the fetal echocardiograms for low risk pregnancies for critical congenital heart disease have been deferred or cancelled with the emphasis on suspected abnormalities by MFMs and obstetricians. In this review, we discuss the literature that has been the basis of screening of low risk pregnancies by pediatric cardiologists. A new approach to more widespread usage of fetal tele-echocardiography may play a large part during COVID-19 and may continue after the pandemic. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
cc91e7e42e914b4bfbbca2132b5d63753c639c99	BACKGROUND The clinical onset serial interval, or the time between the onset of symptoms in successive cases in a chain of infection, is often used as a measurable proxy for the transmission serial interval of an infectious disease. Current estimates of the mean clinical onset serial interval of COVID-19 range from 3.96 to 7.5 days. In this article, we define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee. We study and compare the clinical onset and diagnostic serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS Analyzing the DS4C project data which summarize information on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 cases reported by regional governments in South Korea, we estimate the means of the clinical onset serial interval, the diagnostic serial interval and the di erence between the two. We use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. The mean clinical onset serial interval and mean diagnostic serial interval were estimated to be 3.58 days (95% CI: 2.62, 4.53) and 3.68 days (95% CI: 3.14, 4.22), respectively. A matched sample analysis showed that the diagnostic serial interval was significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval (estimated mean di erence -1.17 days, 95% CI: -2.26, -0.09). CONCLUSIONS The short diagnostic serial interval of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea may explain why South Korea was able to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and avoid high mortality. We conjecture that the mean diagnostic serial interval may serve as a predictor for the success of a country's containment e orts.
07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177	Background: The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months. Once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decisionmakers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.
58dd38a17cf774e90606be6f1df4ca440bfdc610	To date, few data on paediatric COVID-19 have been published, and most reports originate from China. This study aimed to capture key data on children and adolescents with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across Europe to inform physicians and health-care service planning during the ongoing pandemic. Findings 582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, with a median age of 5·0 years (IQR 0·5-12·0) and a sex ratio of 1·15 males per female. 145 (25%) had pre-existing medical conditions. 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to hospital. 48 (8%) individuals required ICU admission, 25 (4%) mechanical ventilation (median duration 7 days, IQR 2-11, range 1-34), 19 (3%) inotropic support, and one (<1%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Significant risk factors for requiring ICU admission in multivariable analyses were being younger than 1 month (odds ratio 5·06, 95% CI 1·72-14·87; p=0·0035), male sex (2·12, 1·06-4·21; p=0·033), pre-existing medical conditions (3·27, 1·67-6·42; p=0·0015), and presence of lower respiratory tract infection signs or symptoms at presentation (10·46, 5·16-21·23; p<0·0001). The most frequently used drug with antiviral activity was hydroxychloroquine ( , and siltuximab (one [<1%] patient). Four children died (case-fatality rate 0·69%, 95% CI 0·20-1·82); at study end, the remaining 578 were alive and only 25 (4%) were still symptomatic or requiring respiratory support. Interpretation COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including infants. However, a small proportion develop severe disease requiring ICU admission and prolonged ventilation, although fatal outcome is overall rare. The data also reflect the current uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.
7da15ad52b22cada80795e400d19086dd4e77657	In this paper, we study the dynamics of an infectious disease in the presence of a continuousimperfect vaccine and latent period. We consider a general incidence rate function with a non-monotonicity property to interpret the psychological effect in the susceptible population. After we propose the model, we provide the well-posedness property and calculate the effective reproduction number R E . Then, we obtain the threshold dynamics of the system with respect to R E by studying the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium when R E < 1 and the system persistence when R E > 1. For the endemic equilibrium, we use the semi-discretization method to analyze its linear stability. Then, we discuss the critical vaccination coverage rate that is required to eliminate the disease. Numerical simulations are provided to implement a case study regarding data of influenza patients, study the local and global sensitivity of R E < 1, construct approximate stability charts for the endemic equilibrium over different parameter spaces and explore the sensitivity of the proposed model solutions.
feacb08611f47d2c68bc8e1116f804aa1f357378	The influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 cause trivial upper and severe lower respiratory infections (Influenza virus 290,000 to 650,000 deaths/year). These viruses come into contact with the airways either by direct projection, by secondary inhalation of airborne droplets, or by handling (fomites). The objective of this article is to clarify the mechanisms of production and penetration of droplets of secretions emitted during all expiratory phenomena likely to transport these viruses and come into contact with the respiratory mucosa. The droplets > 5 µm follow the laws of ballistics, those < 5 µm follow Brownian motion and remain suspended in the air. The aerosols of droplets are very heterogeneous whether the subject is healthy or sick. During an infectious period, not all droplets contain viral RNA. If these RNAs are detectable around patients, on surfaces, and in the ambient air at variable distances according to the studies (from 0.5 m to beyond the patient's room), this is without prejudice to the infectious nature (viability) of the virus and the minimum infectious dose. There is a time lag between the patient's infectious period and that of RNA detection for both viruses. Subsequently, the inhaled particles must meet the laws of fluid dynamics (filtration) to settle in the respiratory tree. All of this partly explains the contagiousness and the clinical expression of these two viruses from the olfactory cleft to the alveoli.
e3a0c96eb90d4df67945fa4c992b9acf4745af7f	Detection and characterisation of the canine parvovirus (CPV-2) strains that are currently circulating are essential for the understanding of viral evolution and the development of measures to control its spread. In the present study, stool samples from 144 dogs were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CPV-2, and 29.2% (42/144) of them were positive. From the 42 positive strains, 71.4% (30) of the dogs had signs of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. The sequencing of the 583 bp fragment of the VP2 gene from the positive strains identified 78.6% (33/42) of them as type 2c, 19% (8/42) as type 2b and 2.4% (1/42) as type 2a. A phylogenetic analysis of the variants circulating in the canine population of Brazil showed that they are very similar to those found in other countries and type 2c has become the predominant type circulating in Brazil.
cd78e2c59e1f0ca2fbd90219d52efcebabaa9aac	After four months of dealing with the pandemic, the city of São Paulo entered a phase of relaxed social-distancing measures in July 2020, and saw its social isolation rate fall at the same time as the number of cases, deaths, and hospital bed occupation declined. We use a calibrated multiagent model to describe these dynamics. We assert here that this phenomenon can be understood as the result of local protective bubbles formed in the city's sub-environments at the same time that there was an exhaustion of contagion networks. Both reduce the velocity of the virus's spread, causing temporary reductions in the epidemic curve, albeit in an unstable equilibrium. These local bubbles can burst anytime and anywhere due to the reintroduction of a few infected people at the same time that there is a reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social-distancing practices. It is important to stress that this hypothesis aligns with the dynamics of the virus's spread observed so far, without needing ad hoc suppositions about natural collective immunity thresholds or heterogeneity in the population's transmission rate, which come with the risk of making mistaken predictions that may could lead to the loss of many lives. The safe way to move ahead is to continue doing all we can to avoid new infections until a vaccine is found that properly and safely creates herd immunity.

Background: COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods: A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17 th , 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects metaanalyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 4 studies. Interpretation: Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.
80b3189ee52e8f3ef0889095e4cf5cc2277563d8	Recent events have thrown the spotlight on infectious disease outbreak response. We developed a data-driven method, EpiGro, which can be applied to cumulative case reports to estimate the order of magnitude of the duration, peak and ultimate size of an ongoing outbreak. It is based on a surprisingly simple mathematical property of many epidemiological data sets, does not require knowledge or estimation of disease transmission parameters, is robust to noise and to small data sets, and runs quickly due to its mathematical simplicity. Using data from historic and ongoing epidemics, we present the model. We also provide modeling considerations that justify this approach and discuss its limitations. In the absence of other information or in conjunction with other models, EpiGro may be useful to public health responders.
0409e26a6c93752d1dcaba11b785a485592b76ac	Objective. Viral agents cause the majority of sore throats. However, there is not currently a score to diagnose viral sore throat. The aims of this study were (i) to find the rate of bacterial and viral causes, (ii) to show the seasonal variations and (iii) to form a new scoring system to diagnose viral sore throat. Methods. A throat culture for group A beta haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) and a nasopharyngeal swab to detect 16 respiratory viruses were obtained from each patient. Over a period of 52 weeks, a total of 624 throat cultures and polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the clinical score. Results. Viral infection was found in 277 patients (44.3%), and GABHS infection was found in 116 patients (18.5%). An infectious cause was found in 356 patients (57.1%). Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected infectious agent overall (highest in November, 34.5%), and the highest GABHS rate was in November (32.7%). Analysis of data provided a scoring system, called the Mistik Score, to diagnose viral sore throat. The predictive model for positive viral analysis included the following variables: absence of headache, stuffy nose, sneezing, temperature of ≥37.5°C on physical examination, and the absence of tonsillar exudate and/or swelling. The probability of a positive viral analysis for a score of 5 was 82.1%. Conclusion. The Mistik Score may be useful to diagnose viral sore throat. We suggest its use either alone or in combination with the Modified Centor Score.
1c956bc94ce590a7ca6c2ace2c0766bbbbfaa0e3	The accuracy and sensitivity of PCR-based methods for detection of hepatitis A virus (HAV) are dependent on the methods used to separate and concentrate the HAV from the infected cells. The pH and ionic strength affect the binding affinity of the virus to cells. In this study, we initially investigated the effects of pH (4.0-10.0) and metal ions (Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + , and Ca 2+ ) on the binding of HAV to oyster digestive cells. The lowest relative binding (RB) of HAV to the cells was found at pH 4.0 and in FeSO 4 solution (64.6% and 68.1%, respectively). To develop an alternative to antibody-dependent immunomagnetic separation prior to detection of HAV using RT-PCR, the binding of HAV to five lectins, peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-1) and soybean agglutinin (SBA), was evaluated using ELISAs. SBA showed significantly higher RB to HAV than Viruses 2014, 6 1038 the other lectins tested. In addition, HAV could be concentrated within 30 min using SBA-linked magnetic bead separation (SMS) prior to the RT-PCR assay. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using SMS combined with RT-PCR to detect HAV at dilutions ranging from 10 −1 -10 −4 of a HAV stock (titer: 10 4 TCID 50 /mL). Keywords: hepatitis A virus; soybean agglutinin linked-magnetic bead separation; lectin; oyster Viruses are a major cause of foodborne illness, due in large part to the contamination of shellfish by hepatitis A virus (HAV) [1] . HAV, the prototype of the Hepatovirus genus within the Piconaviridae family, is composed of an icosahedral capsid that contains a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome [2, 3] . HAV infection is associated with the consumption of virus-contaminated bivalves, including oysters, clams, cockles and mussels, which accumulate the virus from seawater as they filter-feed [4] . Moreover, the increasingly widespread incidence of oyster-related HAV infection is attracting greater attention to the mechanisms underlying the interaction between HAV and oyster [5] . The detection of HAV is influenced by the binding affinity of the virus for receptor cells, which is affected by the pH and ionic strength of the test solution, the presence of compounds competing for sorption, and the properties of the virus [6]. In general, low pH reduces the infectivity of enteroviruses, as it reduces the stability of virus. However, HAV shows greater stability at low pH than other enteroviruses, which increases the possibility of infection to the cells [7]. Exposing a virus to change in pH can affect binding by altering the conformation of viral proteins e.g., hemagglutinin and spike protein, which respectively mediate the binding of influenza and coronaviruses to the target cells [8, 9] . In addition, metal compounds yield specific acids in aqueous solution, so that the ionic strength of a solution will depend on the types of metals present. Consequently, the effects of pH and metal ions on the binding of viruses to cells are considered to be important factors for the detection of viruses in food. To date, however, there have been few studies addressing this issue. Zajac et al. reported that Ca 2+ promotes the interaction between HAV and BS-C-1 cells (monkey kidney cell line) [10], and Bishop et al. showed that low pH and divalent metal ions (Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ ) enhance the interaction between HAV and BS-C-1 cells due to changes in the viral capsid conformation [11] . Although these studies provide useful information on the binding of HAV to BS-C-1 cells, much remains to be learned about the effects of pH and metal ions on the binding of HAV to different cell types. Methods investigated as potential approaches for the detection of HAV in oysters include various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as nested-PCR [12, 13] , reverse transcription (RT)-PCR [14-17] and real time 19] . However, the detection of HAV is not directly compatible with PCR, because the method requires an appropriate concentration of sample, removal of interfering substances and the ability to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious virus particles [20, 21] . Although methods for concentrating virus, such as acid adsorption-elution, solvent extraction, polyethylene glycol precipitation and adsorption-elution-precipitation, have been developed to improve the efficiency of viral detection [22, 23] , these methods are time consuming and are not
d09f2ed39947b0e9a0eb5954146d8c0ed7324e55	To address the massive spike in uncertainties triggered by the coronavirus disease , there is an ever-increasing number of national governments that are rolling out contact-tracing Apps to aid the containment of the virus. The first hugely contentious issue facing the Apps is the deployment framework, i.e. centralised or decentralised. Based on this, the debate branches out to the corresponding technologies that underpin these architectures, i.e. GPS, QR codes, and Bluetooth. This work conducts a pioneering review of the above scenarios and contributes a geolocation mapping of the current deployment. The Apps' vulnerabilities and the directions of research are identified, with a special focus on the Bluetooth-inspired decentralised paradigm.
e44afb75968c128004790e2c1ef01417b948047d	National plastic surgery society websites are an important source of information for patients, family members and healthcare professionals. There are currently no standardized recommendations for the information provided on websites. The aim of this study was to assess the information available on each national plastic surgery society websites on the current pandemic of COVID-19. COVID-19 information provided by national plastic surgery society websites is sparse. Twothirds of national plastic surgery societies do not have a web presence. The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society websites is limited. This study suggests that improvement and increase in COVID-19 information provided by many national plastic surgery society websites is needed. sparse with two-thirds of sovereign nations not represented. There was no integration between national plastic surgery websites other than to conferences and courses. General search engines are by far the most popular means for locating medical information but are often not oriented to providing accurate information for the layperson. 10 A good national plastic society website makes recommendation easier for its members. There are guidelines detailing how a website should be structured to help with ease of reading and navigation. 9 We used Google as the search engine of choice given that over 70% of web users worldwide use it as their primary search engine. 10 In the internet era, plastic surgeons will look to their national plastic societies for COVID-19 information which makes reliable online information ever more critical. 8, [11] [12] [13] This leaves a shortfall in potential plastic surgery education and best standard of care. 11-15 The Cochrane review group provide specific guidelines based on evidence. Guidelines can be helpful in summarizing evidence, standardizing management and guiding appropriate referrals. 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] We found that none of the national plastic societies' websites provided paediatric COVID-19 surgical guidelines for clinicians. Certain national societies have social media accounts. Two aspects to health care professionals' internet use are information gathering and social networking. Social media groups provide social support and allow communication. Social media can be used to improve the communication between national plastic surgery societies and plastic surgeons. It is important to acknowledge that confidentiality is an issue when discussing plastic in surgery in social media. 9, 10 There is minimal integration and standardization between websites, governing bodies and plastic surgical societies. In an increasingly technological health system, where the internet and communication play a crucial role, it is essential that this deficiency be addressed. This highlights the opportunity for collaboration between national plastic surgery societies to standardize the information and quality of care provided to clinicians. 8, 11-13 A limitation of this study is that it could not evaluate if direct information was provided by the leader-ship directly to their society members, e.g. by letter or email. It is necessary that national plastic surgery societies provide their members with the most current, complete, and accurate expert information to use in making decisions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and care for plastic surgery patients. 8, 13, 16 Making efforts to appropriately provide COVID-19 information will lead to great benefits such as increased knowledge, prevention of further infections and coping strategies of patients and health care professionals. 8, 13, 16 
7819d1796328aa4c3eb39d5fd06fd8b3eae4b75d	Objectives To determine the age-specific clinical presentations and incidence of adverse outcomes among patients with China. Design and setting This is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study performed at twenty-four hospitals in Jiangsu, China. Participants From January 10 to March 15, 2020, 625 patients with COVID-19 were involved. Of the 625 patients (median age, 46 years; 329 [52.6%] males), 37 (5.9%) were children (18 years or less), 261 (40%) young adults (19-44 years), 248 (39.7%) middle-aged adults (45-64 years), and 79 (12.6%) elderly (65 years or more). The incidence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes comorbidities increased with age (trend test, P < .0001, P = 0.0003, P < .0001, and P < .0001 respectively). Fever, cough, and shortness of breath occurred more commonly among older patients, especially the elderly, compared to children (Chi-square test, P = 0.0008, 0.0146, and 0.0282, respectively). The quadrant score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend test, both P < .0001). Older patients had significantly more abnormal values in many laboratory parameters than younger patients. Elderly patients contributed the highest proportion of severe or critically-ill cases (33.0%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) (35.4%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), and respiratory failure (31.6%, Chi-square test P = 0.0266), and longest hospital stay (21 days, ANOVA-test P < 0.001). Conclusions Elderly (≥65) patients with COVID-19 had the highest risk of severe or critical illness, intensive care use, respiratory failure, and the longest hospital stay, which may be due partly to that they had higher incidence of comorbidities and poor immune responses to COVID-19.

f8c46a970e588bc5eec7d20be410c4b52fa2defd	Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the critical subjects of research in health and human machine interaction fields in recent years. Algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Decision Tree (DT) and many other algorithms were previously implemented to serve this common goal but most of the traditional Machine learning proposed solutions were not satisfying in term of accuracy and real time testing process. For that, a human activities analysis and recognition system with an embedded trained ANN model on Raspberry PI for an online testing process is proposed in this work. This paper includes a comparative study between the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), using signals produced by the accelerometer and gyroscope, embedded within the BlueNRG-Tile sensor. After evaluate algorithms performance in terms of accuracy and precision which reached an accuracy of 82% for ANN and 99% for RNN, obtained ANN model was implemented in a Raspberry PI for real-time predictions. Results show that the system provides a real-time human activity recognition with an accuracy of 86%.
ac07567f7121d7d463ed9833e3027edf36e9eb0e	The closure of public spaces during the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the cancellation of thousands of community blood drives -a major source of blood for hospitals. The United States is at risk for a secondary public health crisis if a continuous pipeline of community donations is not reestablished. At University of California San Francisco (UCSF), a multidisciplinary group formed to plan and execute a series of emergency blood drives with new protocols to minimize risk of Covid-19 transmission. The working group included UCSF medical students, senior faculty, health system leadership, School of Medicine deans, hospital and campus operations, and a major blood provider. The combined expertise of this group overcame administrative and safety hurdles to establish a replicable model of community-based donation and create an opportunity for people to contribute to a critical public health need. Here, they describe the formation of the working group, major hurdles and solutions, and their blood drive model. » Even in light of shelter-in-place requirements, blood drives are necessary and feasible, and academic medical centers can fill the gap left by the closure of public spaces and cancellation of community drives.
12973d3fb060dab65954cb366d2a2c3b6dfd0340	Background: Clinical spectrum of COVID-19 has been unclear, especially with regard to the presence of pneumonia. We aimed to present clinical course of all laboratory-confirmed adult COVID-19 patients and to identify potential predicting factors of pneumonia. We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, regardless of their disease severity, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. We described the full picture of COVID-19, defined definite outcomes and evaluated factors associated with pneumonia. One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. Of whom, 189 (97.9%) recovered and 4 (2.1%) died. More than half (56%) of the patients were mild, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and 3% were critically ill. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The overall incidence of pneumonia was 39%. Bilateral was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia (65% vs. 35%). Increasing age (OR 2.60 for every 10-year increase from 30 years old; 95% CI, 1.68 to 3.97; p<0.001), obesity (OR 9.17; 95% CI, 2.11 to 39.89; p=0.003), and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.66 per one-degree Celsius increase from 37.2 degree Celsius; 95% CI, 2.32 to 9.34; p<0.001) were potential predicting factors of COVID-19 pneumonia. Severe cases had a longer viral RNA shedding duration than the non-severe cases. The longest observed duration of viral RNA shedding was 45 days.
26de9c12c4ba3511629ff2f4672e3e5327de4591	WHO recommendations for early antimicrobial treatment of childhood pneumonia have been eff ective in reducing childhood mortality, but the last major revision was over 10 years ago. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, new pneumonia pathogens, and new drugs have prompted WHO to assemble an international panel to review the literature on childhood pneumonia and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the empirical treatment of non-severe pneumonia among children managed by fi rst-level health providers. Treatment should target the bacterial causes most likely to lead to severe disease, including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae. The best fi rst-line agent is amoxicillin, given twice daily for 3-5 days, although co-trimoxazole may be an alternative in some settings. Treatment failure should be defi ned in a child who develops signs warranting immediate referral or who does not have a decrease in respiratory rate after 48-72 h of therapy. If failure occurs, and no indication for immediate referral exists, possible explanations for failure should be systematically determined, including non-adherence to therapy and alternative diagnoses. If failure of the fi rst-line agent remains a possible explanation, suitable secondline agents include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with or without an aff ordable macrolide for children over 3 years of age.
c06cc695e9fe227f6610e162bc2b18537c1779a1	On-site multiplex biosensors for innate immunity antibodies are ideal tools for monitoring health status of individuals against various diseases. This study introduces a novel antibody immunoassay testing platform incorporating microfiber-based arrays of antigens to capture specific antibodies. The fabrication and setup of the device revolved around electrospun polystyrene (ESPS) microfibers that act as three-dimensional membrane filters, capable of rapid and multifold analyte capture. In particular, the ESPS microfibers were patterned through localized oxygen plasma to create hydrophilic zones that facilitate fluid flows and immobilizations of antigens. The bulk of this robust antibody immunoassay platform could be installed into a compact syringedriven cassette device, which could perform multiplex antibody immunoassay for antibodies specifically against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with rapid preparation amounting to a total of 5 min, as well as high sensitivity and specificity for the MERS-CoV down to 200 μg/mL.
7a26e70cbf74c5e7b7a7627ab1ec9a2f64e86236	Although most autoimmune diseases are considered to be CD4 T cell-or antibody-mediated, many respond to CD20-depleting antibodies that have limited influence on CD4 and plasma cells. This includes rituximab, oblinutuzumab and ofatumumab that are used in cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and off-label in a large number of other autoimmunities and ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic created concerns about immunosuppression in autoimmunity, leading to cessation or a delay in immunotherapy treatments. However, based on the known and emerging biology of autoimmunity and COVID-19, it was hypothesised that while B cell depletion should not necessarily expose people to severe SARS-CoV-2-related issues, it may inhibit protective immunity following infection and vaccination. As such, drug-induced B cell subset inhibition, that controls at least some autoimmunities, would not influence innate and CD8 T cell responses, which are central to SARS-CoV-2 elimination, nor the hypercoagulation and innate inflammation causing severe morbidity. This is supported clinically, as the majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected, CD20depleted people with autoimmunity have recovered. However, protective neutralizing antibody and vaccination responses are predicted to be blunted until naive B cells repopulate, based on B cell repopulation kinetics and vaccination responses, from published rituximab and unpublished ocrelizumab (NCT00676715, NCT02545868) trial data, shown here. This suggests that it may be possible to undertake dose interruption to maintain inflammatory disease control, while allowing effective vaccination against SARS-CoV-29, if and when an effective vaccine is available.
7ca393c6288201ab687e6521be2e123220d15e59	Urban environment is a highly complex interactive socio-physical system, with competing expectations and priorities. Public health interventions have always had a fundamental role in the control of diseases in cities. WHO considers urbanization as one of the key challenges for public health in the twenty-first century, since cities offer significant opportunities to improve public health if health-enhancing policies and actions are promoted. A multidisciplinary approach is required, but the basic differences existing between technical and health disciplines make the interaction difficult. The multidisciplinary collaboration is still at a very early stage of development, and needs to be further understood and planned. The author concludes stressing the need for a transversal training, but also for sharing knowledge, instruments and methods, involving all the actors in the planning process, to develop a real multidisciplinary approach.
3bf6e190b007abebec86eeb942d87340d72eeb59	The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) encodes a serine-like proteinase (3C-like proteinase or 3CLpro) in ORF 1a of gene 1 between nucleotides 10209 and 11114. We previously have demonstrated that proteins expressed in vitro from a cDNA clone of the 3CLpro region possess proteinase activity, and that the proteinase is able to cleave substrate in trans. We sought to determine if the 27-kDa in vitro cleavage product (p27) was an active form of the 3CLpro and whether this was consistent with the 3CLpro expressed in virus-infected cells. Antibodies directed against the 3CLpro domain detected 27-kDa MHV proteins in vitro and in MHV-A59-infected cells. The 27-kDa proteins were able to cleave substrate in trans without other protein cofactors or supplemental membranes, and the p27 proteinase activity was retained after purification by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. When p27 was expressed in vitro with portions of the aminoand carboxy-terminal flanking domains (MP1 and MP2), p27 was not liberated by cis cleavage. The proteolytic activity of the 27-kDa proteins was inhibited by a variety of cysteine and serine proteinase inhibitors, and was eliminated by the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64d. These results indicate that the 27-kDa protein is a mature proteinase in MHV-A59infected cells, and that appropriate processing of this molecule occurs in vitro. ᭧
790edf3ac22f16fc3ab87c2112abd54c1c7c59e3	The temperature of the human body has been used as a diagnostic sign since the earliest days of clinical medicine. Hippocrates taught that the human hand can be used to judge the presence of fever as early as 400 BC, but instruments to measure this temperature were not developed until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Even then, the journey to the routine measurement of temperature in clinical practice was a long one, with many different people contributing to the arrival of the small, inexpensive, and accurate instrument known throughout the world as 'the clinical thermometer'. A thermometer is essentially an instrument that can measure temperature. It detects changes in physical properties of an object or substance as the temperature of the object changes. The expansion and contraction of air with changes in temperature was noted as early as 220 BC by Philo of Byzantium. It was later realized that water also has this property, as do other fluids and metals such as mercury. As a result, there are now many different forms of thermometers which have been developed over a period of several hundred years.
575c259c326412440346df0d5688e16d4127ab49	The present paper describes the mathematical modeling and dynamics of a novel corona virus (2019-nCoV). We describe the brief details of interaction among the bats and unknown hosts, then among the peoples and the infections reservoir (seafood market). The seafood marked are considered the main source of infection when the bats and the unknown hosts (may be wild animals) leaves the infection there. The purchasing of items from the seafood market by peoples have the ability to infect either asymptomatically or symptomatically. We reduced the model with the assumptions that the seafood market has enough source of infection that can be effective to infect people. We present the mathematical results of the model and then formulate a fractional model. We consider the available infection cases for January 21, 2020, till January 28, 2020 and parameterized the model. We compute the basic reproduction number for the data is R 0 % 2:4829. The fractional model is then solved numerically by presenting many graphical results, which can be helpful for the infection minimization. Ó 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848	Background-Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are common causes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in hematologic malignancy (HM) patients. Predictors of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including the impact of HRV species and types are poorly understood. Objectives-This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV infections among HM patients. April 2012-March 2013, HRV-positive respiratory specimens from symptomatic HM patients were molecularly characterized by analysis of partial viral protein 1 (VP1) or VP4 gene sequence. HRV LRTI risk-factors and outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results-One hundred and ten HM patients presented with HRV URTI (n=78) and HRV LRTI (n=32). Hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0 -9.2; p=0.05) was independently associated with LRTI, but other clinical and laboratory markers of host immunity did not differ between patients . Among 92 typeable respiratory specimens, there were 58 (64%) HRV-As, 12 (13%) HRV-Bs, and 21 (23%) HRV-Cs, and one Enterovirus 68. LRTI rates among HRV-A (29%), HRV-B (17%), and HRV-C (29%) were similar. HRV-A infections occurred year-round while HRV-B and HRV-C infections clustered in the late fall and winter. Conclusions-HRVs are associated with LRTI in HM patients. Illness severity is not attributable to specific HRV species or types. The frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens in HRV LRTIs further substantiates the hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways, similar to that of other community-acquired respiratory viruses.
77badafc14243f109a987b219ea13bbfd922e50f	This brief article aims to interrogate some widely used concepts in framing the interactions between disease epidemics, food systems and nutrition, with a particular focus on the COVID-19 crisis. How should we conceptualize vulnerability in such situationsboth with regard to viral exposure and to subsequent nutrition-relevant impacts of epidemics and responses (including lockdowns)? Is it possible to simultaneously pursue strategies aimed at strengthening resilience and driving transformation ('building back better')? What type of framing and conceptualization can help illuminate entry points and options for responding effectively to interacting crises? In addressing these questions, it's important to re-visit lessons from past attempts to address the impacts of epidemics on food and nutrition security.
81191a43e52981527457fa8003a0e2cc6b7b6442	Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from China in mid-January, 2020. 1 week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic. Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected. Funding None.
d4d0092e3e79f9d5ad3c48f23778317ad867d61c	The ongoing emergence of human infections originating from wildlife highlights the need for better knowledge of the microbial community in wildlife species where traditional diagnostic approaches are limited. Here we evaluate the microbial biota in healthy mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) by analyses of lymph node meta-transcriptomes. cDNA libraries from five individuals and two pools of samples were prepared from retropharyngeal lymph node RNA enriched for polyadenylated RNA and sequenced using Roche-454 Life Sciences technology. Protein-coding and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were taxonomically profiled using protein and rRNA specific databases. Representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected in the seven libraries based on protein-coding transcripts indicating that viable microbiota were present in lymph nodes. Residents of skin and rumen, and those ubiquitous in mule deer habitat dominated classifiable bacterial species. Based on detection of both rRNA and protein-coding transcripts, we identified two new proteobacterial species; a Helicobacter closely related to Helicobacter cetorum in the Helicobacter pylori/Helicobacter acinonychis complex and an Acinetobacter related to Acinetobacter schindleri. Among viruses, a novel gamma retrovirus and other members of the Poxviridae and Retroviridae were identified. We additionally evaluated bacterial diversity by amplicon sequencing the hypervariable V6 region of 16S rRNA and demonstrate that overall taxonomic diversity is higher with the meta-transcriptomic approach. These data provide the most complete picture to date of the microbial diversity within a wildlife host. Our research advances the use of meta-transcriptomics to study microbiota in wildlife tissues, which will facilitate detection of novel organisms with pathogenic potential to human and animals.

17b092942efe36b01f5fb5a5e49b5b0d81d379b6	Background: New York State hospitals are required to implement a respiratory protection program (RPP) consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration respirator standard. Guidance provided during the 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic expanded on earlier recommendations, emphasizing the need to keep staff in all health care settings healthy to maintain services. Methods: New York State hospitals with emergency departments having more than 1,000 visits annually were invited to participate; 23 hospitals participated. Health care workers, unit managers, and hospital managers were interviewed regarding knowledge, beliefs, and practices of respiratory protection. Interviewees were observed donning and doffing an N-95 respirator as they normally would during patient care. Written RPPs for each hospital were evaluated. Results: The majority of the hospitals surveyed had implemented an RPP, although unawareness of the policies and practices, as well as inadequacies in education and training exist among health care workers. Conclusion: Health care workers and other hospital employees may be unnecessarily exposed to airborne infectious diseases. Having an RPP ensures safe and effective use of N-95 respirators and will help prevent avoidable exposure to disease during a pandemic, protecting the health care workforce and patients alike.
93a1731e7eb0079dbff0cb5a3baa8cd6ff459250	Liposomes (phospholipid bilayer vesicles) represent an almost ideal carrier system for the preparation of synthetic vaccines due to their biodegradability and capacity to protect and transport molecules of different physicochemical properties (including size, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and charge). Liposomal carriers can be applied by invasive (e.g. i.m ., s.c ., i.d .) as well as non-invasive (transdermal and mucosal) routes. In the last 15 years, liposome vaccine technology has matured and several vaccines containing liposome-based adjuvants have been approved for human and veterinary use or have reached late stages of clinical evaluation. Given the intensifying interest in liposomebased vaccines, it is important to understand precisely how liposomes interact with the immune system and how they stimulate immunity. It has become clear that the physicochemical properties of liposomal vaccines -method of antigen attachment, lipid composition, bilayer fl uidity, particle charge, and other properties -exert strong effects on the resulting immune response.

These characteristics give them great potentials to be used in biomimetic and soft robotics applications. In this paper, an electrothermal actuator with directly printed microfilament heater was designed, fabricated and characterized. The soft actuator used polyimide (PI) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the structural materials due to their large mismatch of thermal expansion. A microfilament heater was electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printed using a low melting point alloy Bi58/Sn42, and embedded in-between the PI and PDMS layers. The fabricated actuator achieved a maximum curvature of 1.0 1 cm  under a supply voltage as low as 3 V . Resistive self-sensing technology was used to sense the deflection of the actuator and to develop the closed-loop control of the actuator. The bending curvature of the actuator is resulted from the temperature change of the actuator, which can be detected by the electrical resistance change of the embedded heater as they are linearly related. A PID controller was designed for the closed-loop operation of the actuator. Compared with the open-loop operation, the closed-loop controlled actuator demonstrated more rapid and precise response. The developed electrothermal actuator was successfully demonstrated for applications as a soft lifter and soft gripper. Soft electrothermal actuators have attracted wide attention due to their high flexibility, adaptability and light weight.

01055f5d7f608ba085234b8e0d9b912bf304acd1	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become the third most common coronavirus that causes large-scale infections worldwide. The correlations between pathogen susceptibility and blood type distribution have attracted attention decades ago. The current retrospective study aimed to examine the correlation between blood type distribution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, progression, and prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With 265 patients from multiple medical centers and two established cohorts, we found that the blood type A population was more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the blood type distribution was not relevant to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and mortality in COVID-19 patients. These findings are indicative of coping with the great threat since it probed the relationship between blood types and ARDS, AKI, and mortality, in addition to susceptibility in COVID-19 patients.
48764be42938595e40cb6c0bc73fc891a6e962e1	Respiratory viruses cause disease in humans characterized by an abrupt onset of symptoms. Studies in humans and animal models have shown that symptoms are not immediate and appear days or even weeks after infection. Since the initial symptoms are a manifestation of virus recognition by elements of the innate immune response, early virus replication must go largely undetected. The interval between infection and the emergence of symptoms is called the incubation period and is widely used as a clinical score. While incubation periods have been described for many virus infections the underlying mechanism for this asymptomatic phase has not been comprehensively documented. Here we review studies of the interaction between human pathogenic respiratory RNA viruses and the host with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms used by viruses to inhibit immunity. We discuss the concept of the "stealth phase", defined as the time between infection and the earliest detectable inflammatory response. We propose that the "stealth phase" phenomenon is primarily responsible for the suppression of symptoms during the incubation period and results from viral antagonism that inhibits major pathways of the innate immune system allowing an extended time of unhindered virus replication.

42fd59678b98ad2d5416d95b54118d3dfbdd2f30	The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19. The study was an observational, descriptive study. This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants patients diagnosed with COVID- The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. All rights reserved.

da2b69c89152ddb6f2df6c836bd84aebba2a0b65	Background: The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) represents an attractive animal model for the study of respiratory diseases, including influenza. Despite its importance for biomedical research, the number of reagents for molecular and immunological analysis is restricted. We present here a parallel sequencing effort to produce an extensive EST (expressed sequence tags) dataset derived from a normalized ferret cDNA library made from mRNA from ferret blood, liver, lung, spleen and brain. We produced more than 500000 sequence reads that were assembled into 16000 partial ferret genes. These genes were combined with the available ferret sequences in the GenBank to develop a ferret specific microarray platform. Using this array, we detected tissue specific expression patterns which were confirmed by quantitative real time PCR assays. We also present a set of 41 ferret genes with even transcription profiles across the tested tissues, indicating their usefulness as housekeeping genes. The tools developed in this study allow for functional genomic analysis and make further development of reagents for the ferret model possible.
530d71f8cf785777a49637fed7e3448667cf5400	This study was designed to assess factors associated with a high level of knowledge about influenza among displaced persons and labor migrants in Thailand. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 797 documented and undocumented migrants thought to be vulnerable to influenza during the early stages of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Data were collected on socio-demographic factors, migration status, health information sources, barriers to accessing public healthcare services and influenza-related knowledge using a 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire. Among the different types of influenza, participants' awareness of avian influenza was greatest (81%), followed by H1N1 (78%), human influenza (61%) and pandemic influenza (35%). Logistic regression analyses identified 11 factors that significantly predicted a high level of knowledge about influenza. Six or more years of education completed [odds ratio (OR) 6.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.58-13.24)] and recent participation in an influenza prevention activity [OR 5.27 (95% CI 2.78-9.98)] were the strongest predictors. Recommendations to aid public health efforts toward pandemic mitigation and prevention include increasing accessibility of education options for migrants and increasing frequency and accessibility of influenza prevention activities, such as community outreach and meetings. Future research should seek to identify which influenza prevention activities and education materials are most effective.
54566366d7c54ae49a89972e620fba7acb380819	During inflammation, cell surface adhesion molecules guide the adhesion and migration of circulating leukocytes across the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels to access the site of injury. The transmembrane molecule CD13 is expressed on monocytes and endothelial cells and has been shown to mediate homotypic cell adhesion, which may imply a role for CD13 in inflammatory monocyte trafficking. Here, we show that ligation and clustering of CD13 by mAb or viral ligands potently induce myeloid cell/endothelial adhesion in a signal transduction-dependent manner involving monocytic cytoskeletal rearrangement and filopodia formation. Treatment with soluble recombinant (r)CD13 blocks this CD13-dependent adhesion, and CD13 molecules from monocytic and endothelial cells are present in the same immunocomplex, suggesting a direct participation of CD13 in the adhesive interaction. This concept is strengthened by the fact that activated monocytic cells adhere to immobilized recombinant CD13. Furthermore, treatment with anti-CD13 antibodies in a murine model of peritonitis results in a decrease in leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneum, suggesting a potential role for CD13 in leukocyte trafficking in vivo. Therefore, this work supports a new direction for CD13 biology, where these cell surface molecules act as true molecular interfaces that induce and participate in critical inflammatory cell interactions.

6cba6c30e1f246ada356df19cd8b8c392e62b053	The blood-brain barrier (BBB) consists of highly specialized cells including brain microvascular endothelial cells, astrocytes, microglia, pericytes, and neurons, which act in concert to restrict the entry of pathogens, immune cells, and soluble molecules into the central nervous system (CNS). If pathogens manage to cross the BBB and establish infection within the CNS, the BBB can open in a regulated manner to allow leukocyte transmigration into the CNS so that microbes, infected cells, and debris can be cleared. This review highlights how different inflammatory cytokines or signaling pathways disrupt or enhance BBB integrity in a way that regulates entry of neurotropic viruses into the CNS.
739d5fab636ec8d0c532cc74d9a81386e87c406c	Background: COVID 19-related quarantine led to a sudden and radical lifestyle changes, in particular in eating habits. Objectives of the study were to investigate the effect of quarantine on sleep quality (SQ) and body mass index (BMI), and if change in SQ was related to working modalities. We enrolled 121 adults (age 44.9 ± 13.3 years and 35.5% males). Anthropometric parameters, working modalities and physical activity were studied. Sleep quality was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. At baseline, the enrolled subjects were assessed in outpatient clinic and after 40 days of quarantine/ lockdown by phone interview. Results: Overall, 49.6% of the subjects were good sleepers (PSQI < 5) at the baseline and significantly decreased after quarantine (p < 0.001). In detail, sleep onset latency (p < 0.001), sleep efficiency (p = 0.03), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), and daytime dysfunction (p < 0.001) significantly worsened. There was also a significant increase in BMI values in normal weight (p = 0.023), in subjects grade I (p = 0.027) and II obesity (p = 0.020). In all cohort, physical activity was significantly decreased (p = 0.004). However, analyzing the data according gender difference, males significantly decreased physical activity as well as females in which there was only a trend without reaching statistical significance (53.5% vs 25.6%; p = 0.015 and 50.0% vs 35.9%, p = 0.106; in males and females, respectively). In addition, smart working activity resulted in a significant worsening of SQ, particularly in males (p < 0.001). Quarantine was associated to a worsening of SQ, particularly in males doing smart working, and to an increase in BMI values.
30e953751fe8158705903e4cf1548bb4fda4a3f1	COVID-19 has spread from China to the rest of the world in a span of just over three months, escalating into a pandemic that poses several humanitarian as well as scientific challenges. We here investigated the geographical expansion of the infection and correlate it with the annual indexes of air quality observed from the Sentinel-5 satellite orbiting around China, Italy and the U.S.A. Controlling for population size, we find more viral infections in those areas afflicted by Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Higher mortality was also correlated with poor air quality, namely with high PM2.5, CO and NO2 values. In Italy, the correspondence between poor air quality and SARS-CoV-2 appearance and induced mortality was the starkest. Similar to smoking, people living in polluted areas are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality. This further suggests the detrimental impact of climate change on the prevention of epidemics.

5b333df5fa8689be28d40ec2e4db2ea15462f04c	We present the case of a 55-month-old girl who recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection 5 months after undergoing liver transplantation; she had a coinfection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a COVID-19 infection in a pediatric patient with liver transplantation. Additionally, this is also the first report of confirmed co-infection between COVID-19 and EBV. On the basis of this case, we suggest that liver transplantation is not associated with COVID-19 symptom severity and development. Moreover, COVID-19 and EBV co-infections do not seem to aggravate the clinical outcome.
fafaed612e528467c4de06b87dac5b8e106c504f	Purpose: To describe a case of endogenous endophthalmitis caused by Enterococcus faecalis in a cat. Methods: Complete ophthalmic examination, routine haematology, serum biochemistry, evaluation of haemostasis, serologic tests, cytologic evaluation and bacterial culture of aqueous and vitreous humor, urinalysis, thoracic radiograph, abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, and blood culture were performed. Treatment and follow-up are described. Results: A 3-year-old male cat was presented for vision loss, hyperthermia and lethargy. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis with increased intraocular pressure on the right eye. Routine haematology, serum biochemistry, evaluation of haemostasis were unremarkable except a slight decrease of red blood cell count. Tests for diagnosis of FIV, FeLV and Feline Enteric Coronavirus were negative. Cytologic evaluation of aqueous and vitreous humor revealed a suppurative inflammation with the presence of numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture of aqueous and vitreous humor. Urinalysis, radiographic examination of the thorax, abdominal ultrasonography, and echocardiography were unremarkable. Blood culture was negative. No primary infectious site was isolated. The cat was treated with oral ampicillin, oral meloxicam, topical 0.3% gentamicin, 0.1% dexamethasone solutions OU and topical brinzolamide, 0.5% timolol maleate solutions OD. Following this treatment, the cat got well and active signs of uveitis decreased. Six months later, ophthalmic examination revealed vision loss associated with sequelae of anterior uveitis OD and retinal degeneration OS. Conclusions: Bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis is an uncommon cause of uveitis in the feline species. This condition should not be ruled out even if a primary infection has not been identified. Support: None. Purpose: To compare the clinical data of 36 cases of keratomycosis, diagnosed in 35 horses between January 2000 and August 2011, with regards to signalment, season, pre-treatment, clinical appearance, surgical and medical treatment, treatment duration and globe survival. Methods: Medical records were screened for keratomycosis in horses, diagnosed by positive cytology or histology. Results: Of the cases reviewed, 31 (86.1%) presented with ulcerative keratitis, 2 (5.55%) showed corneal infiltrates, 2 (5.55%) had a superficial punctate keratitis and 1 (2.8%) a fluorescein-negative plaque. Thirty eyes received medical and surgical treatment, while three eyes were treated medically only. In three cases the globe was removed at the time of first presentation. The type of medical treatment was compared in the 31 cases presenting with ulcerative keratitis. Three horses underwent immediate enucleation, 16 eyes were treated topically with voriconazole or voriconazole/fluconazole and 12 with other antifungal drug combinations. Different medical protocols did not significantly affect the outcome. Comparing gender, age, pre-treatment with antibiotics or steroids, or type of surgical approach in all horses, no significant differences in outcome were seen. In 23 (63.9%) cases the globe was saved, 11 eyes (30.5%) were enucleated and 2 (5.6%) cases resulted in euthanasia. Conclusions: Regarding outcome, no significant differences between different medical treatment protocols or types of surgical approach could be seen. All cases required aggressive medical and/or surgical treatment. Future studies in central Europe should focus on the identification of fungal pathogens, susceptibility patterns and the efficacy of antifungal drug therapies. Purpose: To evaluate repeated measurements with the new Meibometer Ò MB560 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). Methods: For meibometry a sample was taken by contacting an everted eyelid with a special filter paper. This special paper was placed in the Meibometer and read for ten times. Maximum reading expressed in Meibomian Units (MU) was taken as representative for the lipid-concentration of the sample. Study (A) Meibometry of three healthy humans once daily for four days (n 1 = 24 samples). Each sample was read by two investigators (n 2 = 480 readings). Study (B) Meibometry of eleven healthy dogs once daily for ten days by two investigators (n 3 = 220 samples, n 4 = 2200 readings). Each eye was measured by each investigator (Ia, Ib) for 5 days. Data were transferred to PASW statistics version 18 and a paired t-test was used to compare different means. Results: A) There was no significant difference in the maximum reading of the same sample between investigators (P = 0.42). B) The mean of 220 maximums was 166.10 ± 127.37 MU (mean ± SD). In the same eye the maximums differed between the investigators from 0.37% to 182.56%. Conclusions: Once a sample is obtained repeated measurements by the Meibometer Ò MB560 show only small variation. This is an improvement in comparison to the previous MB550. Different samples taken by the same investigator from the same dog and same eye, show a very wide variation. The origin of the insufficient repeatability of the meibometry seems to be the sampling procedure. Purpose: Reasons for reduced tear production in KCS are known to be multiple -and especially in commonly affected canine breeds like the WHWT a genetic influence has been suggested. Therefore, a prospective survey to document ocular symptoms and to evaluate a possible genetic influence was conducted in purebred WHWT. Methods: Of 238 purebred WHWT of different age and gender underwent a standardized ophthalmic exam of the anterior ocular structures obtained by German ESE (European Eye Scheme Examiner) in the years 1998-2006. A pedigree analysis of these dogs was performed. Results: Mean age of the study population was 7 ± 4 years. More females (41% females, 21% female castrated) than males (28% male, 10% male castrated) were examined. The mean age of the KCS group (n = 125, STT < 15 mm/min or above with KCS treatment) was 8 ± 4 years. Significantly more females were affected by KCS (P < 0.05). Predominant ocular symptoms were discharge (60%) and conjunctivitis (60%). Twenty percent of the KCS patients were not treated, 66% were treated. Most common treatment was artificial tear supplementation (58%), antibiotics (30%) and/or ciclosporine A (30%). Despite treatment, the majority of KCS patients still had a STT <7 mm/ min. Preliminary pedigree analysis suggests an influence of the father. Conclusion: Preliminary data of our study are in line with previous studies showing that in the WHWT females and an age >7 years predisposes to clinical signs of KCS. It seems that there is a genetic influence, but more dogs need to be evaluated to unveil the genetic trait. ABSTRACT NO.: 05 Effect of 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride on corneal sensitivity in normal dogs JY Douet, J Michel and A Regnier Département des Sciences Cliniques, INP/Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire, Université de Toulouse, France Purpose: Assess corneal anaesthesia in normal dogs, following single topical application of 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride. Methods: Of 34 clinically healthy beagles were included in the study. Baseline corneal sensitivity was first measured using a Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer to determine corneal touch threshold (CTT). Twenty-two dogs received one drop of 0.4% oxybuprocaïne solution in a randomly assigned eye, while the fellow eye served as control. The 12 remaining dogs also received oxybuprocaine in a randomly assigned eye and a single drop of 1% tetracaine solution in the fellow eye. CTT was measured 1 and 5 min post-treatment, and every 5 min for a period of 75 min. Results: The overall mean baseline CTT prior to topical anaesthesia was 1.5 ± 0.3 cm without any significant differences between different groups of eyes. In the control eyes, CTT did not vary significantly throughout the observation period. Oxybuprocaine-treated eyes showed a statistically significant decrease in CTT from 1 to 55 min post-treatment compared to control eyes. Maximal decrease in corneal sensitivity was observed from 1 to 15 min post-treatment. The decrease in corneal sensitivity was not statistically different for oxybuprocaine-treated and tetracaine-treated groups. The mean hyperemia and chemosis scores were higher for tetracaine than for oxybuprocaine. Conclusions: The decrease in corneal sensitivity induced by topical application of 0.4% oxybuprocaïne observed in this study is comparable with previous reports using other topical anaesthetics in normal dogs. There was no significant difference compared with tetracaïne as measured by aesthesiometry, but oxybuprocaine was better tolerated than tetracaine. ABSTRACT NO.: 06 Diamond burr superficial keratotomy and superficial linear keratotomy for the treatment of spontaneous chronic corneal epithelial defects (SCCEDs) Purpose: To compare the efficacy of diamond burr superficial keratotomy and superficial linear keratotomy for the treatment of spontaneous chronic corneal epithelial defects (SCCEDs). Methods: Between January 2011 and December 2011 109 dogs were presented to the Animal Eye Center in Wiesbaden, Germany with a history of chronic superficial corneal ulceration of up to three months duration. Sixty-two dogs were male (19 castrated) and 47 were females (13 spayed). The age ranged from 10 to 216 months (18 years) with a median of 105.9 months (8.8 years). Thirty-six breeds including mixed breeds were included in the study. All dogs were subjected to a complete ophthalmic examination including -but not limited toslitlamp biomicroscopy and fluorescein. All epithelial defects were treated by dry cotton swab debridement and then randomly assigned to one of two groups. Dogs in group A were treated by diamond burr superficial keratotomy, dogs in group B were treated by further debridement with a curette followed by superficial linear keratotomy. Dogs were treated medically with topical antibiotic therapy and rechecked weekly until fluorescein staining was negative and corneal integrity was restored. Results: All dogs healed within 1-8 weeks (median 2.03 weeks). Dogs in group A healed after a median time of 1.52 weeks (1-5 weeks). Dogs in Group B were Ó 2012 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists Veterinary Ophthalmology (2012) 15, 6, E1-E12 ABSTRACT NO.: 10 Dry corneal transplantation in cats A Boikova and A Khakimov Oculus, center of veterinary ophthalmology, St Petersburg, Russia Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of dry cornea transplantation in cats. Methods: Dry feline corneas were transplanted in seven cats with penetrating corneal ulcers or sequestra. Donor corneas were collected from euthanized cats. Epithelium was debrided and the corneas placed in a 1:1 solution of gentamycine and NaCl 0.9% for 3 min. They were then placed on top of a container filled with silica gel, and dried for 5 h in room air temperature. Dried corneas were stored in plastic container without preservatives for up to 6 months. Prior to use, they were soaked in a 1:1 gentamycine and NaCl 0.9% solution for 5 min, and transplanted routinely. In one case, the transplantation was combined with a conjunctivoplasty procedure. Results: Follow up time ranged from 3.5 to 11 months. At the time of the last recheck, 6/7 eyes were visual with minimal signs of inflammation. In three eyes, only minor opacification was noted in the transplanted corneas. In another three eyes (including the combined procedure case) the transplanted cornea became densely opaque, but vision was presented through the peripheral, non transplanted cornea which remained transparent. One eye was enucleated due to severe keratitis and panophthalmitis. Conclusion: Cat cornea can be easily harvested, dried and preserved for a long time. Transplantation yielded very good results in cats, with 6/7 eyes retaining vision. Corneal cross-linking in 10 horses Purpose: To monitor effects of corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) in horses with ulcerative keratitis. Methods: Ten horses, aged 1 month-15 years, with corneal ulcers were treated in this pilot study. Nine horses were presented with deep stromal ulcers and one with a superficial ulcer. Samples for microbiological culturing and cytology were obtained from the ulcers. The horses were sedated with a continuous detomidine infusion, akinesia of the eyelids and topical anaesthesia of the cornea were induced. Isotonic riboflavin eye drops (Medio-cross GmbH, Neudorf, Germany) were instilled every 2 min for 25 min. An UVA-light source emitting 3 mW/cm 2 of 365 nm light (CCL-365; Peschke-Meditrade GmbH, Huenenberg, Switzerland) was used to illuminate the riboflavin-laden area for 30 min. Topical treatment in accordance with results from cultures and cytology and systemic NSAIDs were given postoperatively. Results: CXL could be performed in all 10 horses. Two horses were diagnosed with mycotic, five with bacterial and three with aseptic ulcerative keratitis. The ulcers of eight horses epithelialized after 4-26 days after CXL. During follow-up between 5 and 19 months, no side effects have been observed. One horse with fungal keratitis was enucleated 4 days after treatment due to poor uveitis control. The horse with superficial ulcer did not epithelialize and was then treated surgically. Conclusions: CXL can be performed in standing, sedated horses. Deleterious effects attributed to CXL could not be observed, neither in horses with infectious nor aseptic ulcerative keratitis. Our results warrant further studies of the efficacy of CXL compared to conventional medical treatment.

Purpose: To provide a detailed description of the disease phenotype of autosomal recessively inherited open-angle glaucoma in beagle dogs that are unrelated to the closed University of Florida colony. Methods: Two independent lines of beagle dogs with inherited open-angle glaucoma were established. A total of 81 affected and related normal control dogs were evaluated from birth up to 5-years of age. All of the affected dogs were homozygous for the Gly661Arg missense mutation in the metalloproteinase ADAMTS10. In addition to ophthalmic examinations, incl. monthly diurnal IOP measurements, eyes were collected from selected dogs for evaluation of scleral biomechanics and morphology (n = 8) as well as for examination by electron microscopy (n = 4). Results: In affected dogs ocular hypertension typically developed between 1 and 2 years of age with IOPs consistently >25 mmHg. Stretching and tearing of the lens zonules with protrusion of vitreous into the anterior chamber occurred as early as 6 months of age in the affected normotensive eyes. Zonular ligament dysplasia was present as previously reported in terriers and other breeds with hereditary lens luxation. Scleral resistance to deformation under dynamic loading (i.e. complex modulus) as well as dynamic viscosity were significantly lower between in the affected compared to age-matched controls at 5-7 months of age (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Primary abnormalities in the extracellular matrix of lens zonules and sclera of glaucomatous beagles are suspected to be a direct consequence of the ADAMTS10 mutation. These findings are consistent with Weill-Marchesani syndrome, the homologous human condition.

5c2b4f81e34c3895ccc3eb63df654cc00dd93615	Three reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays with lateral flow dipsticks (RT-RPA-LFD) were developed for identification of the matrix and hemagglutinin (HA) genes to detect influenza A virus and distinguish subtypes H1 and H3. Assessment of the assays' specificity showed that there was no crossreactivity with other targets. Their limits of detection were 123.6 copies per reaction for the matrix gene, 677.1 copies per reaction for the H1 HA gene, and 112.2 copies/reaction for the H3 HA gene. Of 111 samples tested by RT-RPA-LFD assays, 27 were positive for influenza A virus, 14 were positive for H1, and 10 were positive for H3. Compared to the results obtained from real-time RT-PCR assays, the sensitivity of RT-RPA-LFD assays was 75%, 93.33% and 71.43% for the matrix, H1, and H3, with 100% specificity. The sensitivity of RT-RPA-LFD assays is lower than that of real-time RT-PCR, comparable or better than that of conventional RT-PCR, and much better than that of RIDTs. In conclusion, these assays offer an efficient and reliable tool for identification and subtyping of influenza A virus (subtype H1 and H3) in the resource-limited setting.
6bfd2809e31c992d160d33b11111f8cebda23876	Background: Sepsis is a severe condition characterised by the body's systemic inflammatory response to infection. The specific sepsis-related biomarkers should be used in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic response monitoring, rational use of antibiotics, and prognosis (risk stratification), etc. Results: In this study, we investigated the expression level of Decoy Receptor 3 (DcR3) and the mechanism of high expression in sepsis patients. Septic cell model experiments were performed by treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and Jurkat cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and zymosan, respectively. SP600125, SB203580 and ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) were used to inhibit JNK1/2, p38MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways in septic cell model, respectively. These results showed that DcR3 levels were higher in sepsis group than control. DcR3 mRNA and protein levels in HUVECs were increased following treatment with LPS, LTA and zymosan, and also increased in Jurkat cells treated by LPS, but not by LTA or zymosan. When HUVECs were treated with the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, DcR3 expression was decreased compared with controls. However, SP600125 and SB203580 had no effect on DcR3 mRNA or protein levels. The results indicated that DcR3 secretion proceeded through the NF-κB signalling pathway in HUVECs.

c6d57ca75d1f3bc47118301c692c10ac34cdbb82	The Covid-19 coronavirus has spread almost all over the world. Though it has been reported recently that the epidemic declines in China, in other countries it still hasn't achieved peak level. The data analysis methods may help struggling against the disease. The Covid-19 Tracking Germany dataset has been handled in the research. It's daily refreshed dataset available at the kaggle.com site. It contains information on number of fallen ill people in Germany. The cases are grouped by federal land, city, age diapason and date. The main goal of the research is to underline differences in morbidity registered in different lands of Germany. There have been published new suggestions about connection between coronavirus morbidity and BCG vaccination. This question is also taken into account. Analysis based on the handled dataset is able to make only oblique conclusions because of lack of information. Differences in coronavirus morbidity in various regions and various age groups are highlighted. The regions of Germany are clustered into groups by gravity of recent situation.

This study aims to assess acceptability of patients and clinicians towards teleconsultation in oral and maxillofacial surgery compared with an expected face-to-face assessment. 340 telephone clinic patient episodes were surveyed over the initial 7-week period of pandemic-related service restriction. Appointment outcomes from a further 420 telephone consultations were additionally scrutinised. 59.1% of patients expressed a strong preference for teleconsultation with only 13.1% stating a moderate or strong preference for face-to-face assessment. Diagnostic accuracy was highlighted as a concern for both clinicians and patients due to inherent inability to conduct a traditional clinical examination, notable in 43.5% of qualitative comments. Logistical concerns, communications needs and other individual circumstances formed the other emerging themes. The majority of remote J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 consultations (59.5%) were outcomed as requiring further review. 29.3% of patients were discharged. These findings suggest that the increasing use of remote follow-up in carefully selected subgroups can facilitate efficient and acceptable healthcare delivery. Although 'in-person' clinical appointments will continue to be regarded as the default safe and gold standard management modality, OMFS departments should consider significant upscaling of teleconsultation services.
8c38c0f02fa4ee9f3d38eae96aefcb59f64bc3f1	The development of technologies with rapid and sensitive detection capabilities and increased throughput have become crucial for responding to greater number of threats posed by emerging and re-emerging viruses in the recent past. The conventional identification methods require time-consuming culturing, and/or detection of antibodies, which are not very sensitive and specific. The recent advances in molecular biology techniques in the field of genomics and proteomics greatly facilitate the rapid identification with more accuracy. The real-time assays viz; SYBR green I based real time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP have been developed for rapid detection as well as typing of some of the emerging arboviruses of biomedical importance viz; Dengue, Japanese Encephalitis, Chikungunya, West Nile, SARS and Swine Flu etc. Both these techniques are capable of detection and differentiation as well as quantifying viral load with higher sensitivity, rapidity and specificity. One of the most important advantages of RT-LAMP is its field applicability, without requirement of any sophisticated equipments. The establishment of these real time molecular assays will certainly facilitate the rapid detection of viruses with high degree of precision and accuracy in future.

The ongoing problem of police brutality and the resulting deaths of George Floyd (1), Breonna Taylor (2), and many other Black people in the United States (3) has rightly shaken the country. Acts of racism should cause us to question the level to which we have personally participated in the systems of racial inequity that facilitate such acts. We all have an obligation to identify the ways that systemic racism functions in our society and in science. As scientists, we prefer to believe that we are driven by data and are immune to such detrimental behaviors. Yet, if we are honest, we know that this is not always true. Citation Schloss PD
1c995ac4ae70bbcc5da53211e20df4398d1ce55d	The Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) induces a severe disease that fulfils many requirements of an animal model of fulminant hepatic failure. However, a better knowledge of molecular mechanisms contributing to liver damage is required, and it is unknown whether the RHDV induces liver autophagy and how it relates to apoptosis. In this study, we attempted to explore which signalling pathways were involved in the autophagic response induced by the RHDV and to characterize their role in the context of RHDV pathogenesis. Rabbits were infected with 2 × 10 4 hemmaglutination units of a RHDV isolate. The autophagic response was measured as presence of autophagic vesicles, LC3 staining, conversion of LC3-I to autophagosome-associated LC3-II and changes in expression of beclin-1, UVRAG, Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L1 and p62/SQSTM1. RHDV-triggered autophagy reached a maximum at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) and declined at 30 and 36 hpi. Phosphorylation of mTOR also augmented in early periods of infection and there was an increase in the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones BiP/GRP78, CHOP and GRP94. Apoptosis, measured as caspase-3 activity and expression of PARP-1, increased significantly at 30 and 36 hpi in parallel to the maximal expression of the RHDV capsid protein VP60. These data indicate that RHDV infection initiates a rapid autophagic response, perhaps in an attempt to protect liver, which associates to ER stress development and is independent from downregulation of the major autophagy suppressor mTOR. As the infection continues and the autophagic response declines, cells begin to exhibit apoptosis.
81f223866bd4b867bb3526d902da971287ad7de7	The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, the development of autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells in patients with SARS at different time periods (the first week: phase I, 1 month after the disease onset: phase II/phase III) were investigated. Antibodies in sera of patients and healthy controls against: (1) A549 human pulmonary epithelial cell-line, (2) human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC), (3) primary human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPEC) were detected by cell-based ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence staining. The results revealed that serum levels of IgG anti-A549 cells antibodies, IgG anti-HUVEC antibodies, and IgM anti-HPEC antibodies were significantly higher in SARS patients at phase II/phase III than those in healthy controls. Sera from SARS patients at phase II/ phase III could mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity against some A549 cells and HPEC. It is concluded that some autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells would be developed after SARS-CoV infection and this phenomenon may indicate post-infectious cellular injury and also induce SARS-induced immunopathology.
02c21bef8cc81d14e19c41cf4888c48282cf2ba0	The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an emerging pathogen of critical significance to international public health. Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable "choke points" for pharmacologic interventions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving rapid refinements with a two-to-four week release cycle. In a sustained community effort, this consortium is integrating data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health. Guiding principles: motivation  The model should investigate the dynamics of infection and treatment, not merely endpoints.  The model should help the community ask "what if" questions to guide experiments and interventions 9,10 .  Community consensus will be gathered and efforts pooled into a "standardized" model that captures key SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. The model will be supplied to the community for parallel studies by multiple labs.  The model framework will be built with relatively sparse data, relying upon domain expertise and observations to choose its general form and assess its qualitative behavior.  The model will be modular. Each submodel will have well-defined inputs and outputs, allowing parallel development and replacement of submodels with improved versions without change to the overall integrated model or other submodels.  As part of the model formulation, documentation, and dissemination, we will craft clearly delineated "conceptual model and hypotheses" to encourage development of independent models with distinct methodologies and software frameworks.  The submodels will be independently executable and verifiable, allowing parallel development.  The overall model framework will be released periodically released numbered versions (distributions) that bundle the best working version of each submodel as it exists at the time of release, allowing end-users (the community) to use well-defined, well-tested snapshots of the project.  The model (and known parameter values) will be made publicly available as open source for maximum public benefit.  The model will be made publicly available as an interactive web app to encourage community participation, to accelerate scientific dissemination, and to increase public educational benefit.  Rapid prototyping will be used to encourage a fast develop-test-refine cycle, build expertise, and gain community feedback.  Data and parameter sharing is encouraged throughout this effort for use in the user community following the model's "completion."  The model will be developed to a point that it has correct qualitative behavior so that calibration is likely to succeed. This is the "product" for use in subsequent investigations by multiple teams. See the scoping statements above.  After the model prototyping is complete (the goal of this paper), a maintenance and support phase will be entered to fix bugs, support scientist users, and add features identified by the user community. Box 1: Guiding principles for the rapid prototyping a modular, multiscale model. The community identified a series of driving biological questions concerning COVID-19 to guide the development of the model framework (see Box 2). It is expected that the model will not initially be able to address all of the questions listed; rather, the development plan envisions that with each iteration of the model framework it will expand in its representational capacity as directed by the topics listed in Box 2. Furthermore, as with all modeling projects, we anticipate that as the framework develops it will generate new questions and/or be responsive to the rapidly evolving knowledge-base concerning COVID-19. This rapid prototyping effort brings together specialists from a broad variety of domains: virology and infectious Box 2: Community-selected scientific questions driving the model's development. All the authors dedicate this work in memory of Bing Liu, our co-author, colleague, and friend. His insights and community-minded contributions are sorely missed.

7850f4f7cfe6f4dcfbce9b3e050047d787f58291	Aggressive chemotherapy has a deleterious effect on all components of the defense system of the human body. The resulting neutropenia as well as injury to the pulmonary and gastrointestinal mucosa allow pathogenic micro-organisms easy access to the body. The symptoms of an incipient infection are usually subtle and limited to unexplained fever due to the absence of granulocytes. This is the reason why prompt administration of antimicrobial agents while waiting for the results of the blood cultures, the so-called empirical approach, became an undisputed standard of care. Gram-negative pathogens remain the principal concern because their virulence accounts for serious morbidity and a high early mortality rate. Three basic intravenous antibiotic regimens have evolved: initial therapy with a single antipseudomonal b-lactam, the so-called monotherapy; a combination of two drugs: a b-lactam with an aminoglycoside, a second b-lactam or a quinolone; and, thirdly, a glycopeptide in addition to b-lactam monotherapy or combination. As there is no single consistently superior empirical regimen, one should consider the local antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates in the selection of the initial antibiotic regimen. Not all febrile neutropenic patients carry the same risk as those with fever only generally respond rapidly, whereas those with a clinically or microbiologically documented infection show a much slower reaction and less favorable response rate. Once an empirical antibiotic therapy has been started, the patient must be monitored continuously for nonresponse, emergence of secondary infections, adverse effects, and the development of drug-resistant organisms. The average duration of fever in serious infections in eventually successfully treated neutropenic patients is 4-5 days. Adaptations of an antibiotic regimen in a patient who is clearly not responding is relatively straightforward when a micro-organism has been isolated; the results of the cultures, supplemented by susceptibility testing, will assist in selecting the proper antibiotics. The management of febrile patients with pulmonary infiltrates is complex. Bronchoscopy and a high resolution computer-assisted tomographic scan represent the cornerstones of all diagnostic procedures, supplemented by serological tests for relevant viral pathogens and for aspergillosis. 137 138 A. Herbers and B.E. de Pauw found to be responsible for two thirds of all superinfections that may surface during broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of neutropenic patients. Antibiotic treatment is usually continued for a minimum of 7 days or until culture results indicate that the causative organism has been eradicated and the patient is free of major signs and symptoms. If a persistently neutropenic patient has no complaints and displays no evidence of infection, early watchful cessation of antibiotic therapy or a change to the oral regimen should be considered.
258dc6960914cb934076d169f8c02d51883cf571	Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an endogenous regulator of the renin angiotensin system. Increased circulating ACE2 predicts adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), but it is unknown if elevated plasma ACE2 activity predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). We prospectively recruited patients with obstructive CAD (defined as !50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery and/or !70% stenosis in ! 1 other major epicardial vessel on invasive coronary angiography) and measured plasma ACE2 activity. Patients were followed up to determine if circulating ACE2 activity levels predicted the primary endpoint of MACE (cardiovascular mortality, HF or myocardial infarction). We recruited 79 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. The median (IQR) plasma ACE2 activity was 29.3 pmol/ml/min [21.2-41.2]. Over a median follow up of 10.5 years [9.6-10.8years], MACE occurred in 46% of patients (36 events). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, above-median plasma ACE2 activity was associated with MACE (log-rank test, p = 0.035) and HF hospitalisation (p = 0.01). After Cox multivariable adjustment, log ACE2 activity remained an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-4.72, p = 0.009) and HF hospitalisation (HR: 4.03, 95% CI: 1.42-11.5, p = 0.009).
d1e79d27f13acedced4a32ce96db366c99a395b1	Currently (mid May 2020), most active cases of COVID-19 are found in Europe and North America while it is still in the initial phases in Africa. As COVID-19 mortality occurs mainly in elderly and as Africa has a comparably young population, the death rates should be lower than on other continents. We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMR) using age-specific case fatality rates for COVID-19 and the age structure of the population of Africa and of other continents. Compared to a European or Northern American population, the standardised mortality ratio was only 0.22 and 0.25, respectively, corresponding to reduction of deaths rates to a quarter. Compared to the Asian and Latin American & Caribbean population, the SMR was 0.43 and 0.44, respectively, corresponding to half the death rate for Africa. It is useful to quantify the isolated effect of the African age-structure on potential COVID-19 mortality for illustrative and communication purposes, keeping in mind the importance of .

7697fcf19fb5548783f66563f33f7977ff59cd7a	The infiltration of immune cells in the central nervous system is a common hallmark in different neuroinflammatory conditions. Accumulating evidence indicates that resident glial cells can establish a cross-talk with infiltrated immune cells, including T-cells, regulating their recruitment, activation and function within the CNS. Although the healthy CNS has been thought to be devoid of professional dendritic cells (DCs), numerous studies have reported the presence of a population of DCs in specific locations such as the meninges, choroid plexuses and the perivascular space. Moreover, the infiltration of DC precursors during neuroinflammatory situations has been proposed, suggesting a putative role of these cells in the regulation of lymphocyte activity within the CNS. On the other hand, under specific circumstances, microglial cells are able to acquire a phenotype of DC expressing a wide range of molecules that equip these cells with all the necessary machinery for communication with T-cells. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the expression of molecules involved in the cross-talk with T-cells in both microglial cells and DCs and discuss the potential contribution of each of these cell populations on the control of lymphocyte function within the CNS.
575b5b1f8891fc4b8e561d623ad4785f58ae682e	The recent pandemic associated with SARS-CoV-2, a virus of the Coronaviridae family, has resulted in an unprecedented number of infected people. The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it imperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase (2 0 -O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2 0 -O-MTase methylates the ribose 2 0 -O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (DG), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From the virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (DG ¼ À9.8 kcal/mol) & Raltegravir (DG ¼ À7.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (DG ¼ À9.4 kcal/mol) and Bictegravir (DG ¼ À8.4 kcal/mol) for 2 0 -OMTase]. After the extensive computational analysis, we proposed that Raltegravir, Paritaprevir, Bictegravir and Dolutegravir are excellent lead candidates for these crucial proteins and they could become potential therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

4cd5e0a3e13b16bea2c7e595e6a77344fa3caebc	Poxviruses are important pathogens of man and numerous domestic and wild animal species. Cross species (including zoonotic) poxvirus infections can have drastic consequences for the recipient host. Bats are a diverse order of mammals known to carry lethal viral zoonoses such as Rabies, Hendra, Nipah, and SARS. Consequent targeted research is revealing bats to be infected with a rich diversity of novel viruses. Poxviruses were recently identified in bats and the settings in which they were found were dramatically different. Here, we review the natural history of poxviruses in bats and highlight the relationship of the viruses to each other and their context in the Poxviridae family. In addition to considering the zoonotic potential of these viruses, we reflect on the broader implications of these findings. Specifically, the potential to explore and exploit this newfound relationship to study coevolution and cross species transmission together with fundamental aspects of poxvirus host tropism as well as bat virology and immunology.

This review evaluates IFN-I during infection with an emphasis on work carried out IFN-I-receptor-deficient mice.
2a90543a82ae4b2916e12f6294b7a37aa8142942	Background: Direct immunofluorescence assays (DFA) are a rapid and inexpensive method for the detection of respiratory viruses and may therefore be used for surveillance. Few epidemiological studies have been published based solely on DFA and none included respiratory picornaviruses and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We wished to evaluate the use of DFA for epidemiological studies with a long-term observation of respiratory viruses that includes both respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV. Methods: Since 1998 all children hospitalized with respiratory illness at the University Hospital Bern have been screened with DFA for common respiratory viruses including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, and parainfluenza virus 1-3. In 2006 assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV were added. Here we describe the epidemiological pattern for these respiratory viruses detected by DFA in 10'629 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 8'285 patients during a 12-year period (1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010). Results: Addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV raised the proportion of positive DFA results from 35% to 58% (p < 0.0001). Respiratory picornaviruses were the most common viruses detected among patients ≥1 year old. The seasonal patterns and age distribution for the studied viruses agreed well with those reported in the literature. In 2010, an hMPV epidemic of unexpected size was observed. Conclusions: DFA is a valid, rapid, flexible and inexpensive method. The addition of assays for respiratory picornaviruses and hMPV broadens its range of viral detection. DFA is, even in the "PCR era", a particularly adapted method for the long term surveillance of respiratory viruses in a pediatric population.

Our report aims to describe a case of placental swabs positive for the molecular research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an asymptomatic woman with positive rhino-pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 who underwent an urgent cesarean section in our obstetrics unit. Sample collection, processing, and laboratory testing were conducted in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidance. In the next months, conclusive data on obstetrical outcomes concerning the gestational age and pregnancy comorbidity as well as the eventual maternal-fetal transmission are needed.
efe9fd97ff178499cc5b567e5bd7a945d29a50f8	Acculturation may limit HIV-positive Asian Americans' active interactions with patient-healthcare providers (HCP) and utilization of HIV healthcare services; however, the specific mediation effect of acculturation still unknown. A bias-corrected factor score path analysis was performed to examine the proposed model of relations among acculturation, stigma, stress, and patient-HCP relationships. A convenience sample of 69 HIV-positive Asian Americans in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City were recruited and collect data were collected on demographics, HIV-related stigma, stress, and patient-HCP relationships. HIV stigma and stress had a direct, negative effect on patient-HCP relationships. Acculturation had a positive total effect on patient-HCP relationships, and was mediated by HIV stigma and stress. A acculturation also had a direct impact on stigma and stress. Acculturation, HIV-related stigma, and stress are key elements to achieving good patient-HCP relationships, and provide insights on the design of culturally sensitive interventions to improve patient-HCP relationships.

a2edd17a944bc5fc7506fd4e5d519d552cf19951	Aim The objective of this study was to assess beliefs, misconception, and anxiety in relation to swine flu outbreak and whether perception of the outbreak predicted changes in behavior. Subject and methods In November 2009, we conducted an Internet-based cross-sectional survey of college students aged 18-24 years in a Midwestern State in the USA. We collected information on swine flu knowledge, perception on immunization safety, perceived efficacy of recommended behavior, changed behavior, and anxiety. Results Of the 236 respondents, 83.1% had some anxiety about swine flu, 64.8% believed avoiding crowded places was preventive, 33.5% believed the 2009 swine flu vaccine was safe, and 36.9% showed interest in receiving the vaccine. Misconceptions about swine flu contagion via eating cooked pork, water sources, and insect bites were common. Respondents were unaware of transmissions via contaminated objects and droplets. Only 42.6% were satisfied with governmental efforts. Women were more likely to wash hands frequently than men (odds ratio 2.80, p<0.001). Conclusion There is a gap in swine flu knowledge, minimal risk reduction, increased amount of anxiety, and skepticism about swine flu vaccine safety. These gaps warrant serious attention to inform the public about specific actions regarding swine flu.

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by individuals with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infections is likely occurred. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in contaminated environments of one household. A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 3 Data concerning the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients are lacking. We report a three-family cluster of infections involving asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic transmission. Eight (53%) of 15 members from three families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of eight patients, three were asymptomatic and one was paucisymptomatic. An asymptomatic mother transmitted the virus to her son, and a paucisymptomatic father transmitted the virus to his three-month-old daughter. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the environment of one household. The complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients were >99.9% identical and were clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries.
06e89cafce095f075c8a197fbdfb78c259133a8b	Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus (family Arenaviridae), is the etiological agent of Lassa fever, a severe human disease that is reported in more than 100,000 patients annually in the endemic regions of West Africa with mortality rates for hospitalized patients varying between 5-10%. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against Lassa fever for use in humans. Here, we review the published literature on the life cycle of Lassa virus with the specific focus put on Lassa fever pathogenesis in humans and relevant animal models. Advancing knowledge significantly improves our understanding of Lassa virus biology, as well as of the mechanisms that allow the virus to evade the host's immune system. However, further investigations are required in order to design improved diagnostic tools, an effective vaccine, and therapeutic agents.
657602c5e4a96575433b73793bbf7e33110262e7	Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) has a strict species-specificity. Because only a subset of mouse primary macrophages have been identified that can support LDV replication in vitro, the precise molecular mechanism of viral entry and replication remains unclear. To analyze the LDV envelope proteins, which probably mediate viral attachment to the host cell, we developed a mammalian system for stable co-expression of LDV open reading frame (ORF) 5-and ORF 6-encoded proteins (ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins), which correspond to envelope VP-3 and M/VP-2, respectively, and compared these expressed proteins to the native ones. Western blotting analysis combined with Nglycanase digestion revealed that ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins were similar in size to native VP-3 and M/VP-2, and that ORF 5 protein was N-glycosylated, like the native VP-3. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and were colocalized in most cells. Moreover, ORF 5 protein was localized both in the perinuclear region and the Golgi complex and transported to the cell surface. This mammalian expression system in which the exogenously expressed proteins closely resemble the native proteins will provide the experimental basis for further studies of the interactions between LDV envelope proteins and host cells.

Methods: We performed a review of the literature pertaining to cancer, financial toxicity, and economic challenges. Results: Multiple societies have put forth recommendations to modify delivery of cancer care in order to minimize patient exposure to the virus. Cancer survivors, especially patients with head and neck cancer, have been disproportionately affected by rising unemployment levels and economic recessions in the past, both of which are linked to higher cancer mortality. Patients who rely on employer-provided insurance and do not qualify for Medicaid may lose access to life-saving treatments. Conclusions: It is essential to implement interventions and policy changes in order to mitigate the effects of this pandemic but also to ensure this becomes a nonissue during the next one.

Clinical Features: A 26-year-old woman presented with acute sinusitis of 10-day duration. Her symptoms included facial pressure and soreness around the frontal and maxillary sinuses, a headache, pharyngitis, a fever, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion with postnasal drip, a productive cough, myalgias, and fatigue. Intervention and Outcome: After administration of 12 to 15 drops of a 2 000-mg tincture of G glabra twice a day, improvements were noted. Resolution of her symptoms occurred after 3 days of treatment. Conclusion: For the treatment of acute sinusitis, G glabra may be a natural therapeutic remedy. (J Chiropr Med 2018;17:268-274) 
67f9fc7574738473d4155929c1637f1e7c36afb2	Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), first identified in 2012, is a swine enteropathogen now found in many countries. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, a core component of PDCoV, is essential for virus replication and is a significant candidate in the development of diagnostics for PDCoV. In this study, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated and tested for reactivity with three truncations of the full protein (N1, N2, N3) that contained partial overlaps; of the five monoclonals chosen tested, each reacted with only the N3 truncation. The antibody designated 4E88 had highest binding affinity with the N protein and was chosen for in-depth examination. The 4E88 epitope was located to amino acids 308-AKPKQQKKPKK-318 by testing the 4E88 monoclonal for reactivity with a series of N3 truncations, then the minimal epitope, 309-KPKQQKKPK-317 (designated EP-4E88), was pinpointed by testing the 4E88 monoclonal for reactivity with a series of synthetic peptides of this region. Homology analysis showed that the EP-4E88 sequence is highly conserved among PDCoV strains, and also shares high similarity with sparrow coronavirus (HKU17), Asian leopard cat coronavirus (ALCCoV), quail coronavirus (UAE-HKU30), and sparrow deltacoronavirus (SpDCoV). Of note, the PDCoV EP-4E88 sequence shared very low similarity (<22.2%) with other porcine coronaviruses (PEDV, TGEV, PRCV, SADS-CoV, PHEV), demonstrating that it is an epitope that can be used for distinguishing PDCoV and other porcine coronavirus. 3D structural analysis revealed that amino acids of EP-4E88 were in close proximity and may be exposed on the surface of the N protein.
dedefa17274ab922ef4d06a0fd7b27ae27095c33	Lipids form an integral, structural, and functional part of all life forms. They play a significant role in various cellular processes such as membrane fusion, fission, endocytosis, protein trafficking, and protein functions. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed their more impactful and critical involvement in infectious diseases, starting with the manipulation of the host membrane to facilitate pathogenic entry. Thereafter, pathogens recruit specific host lipids for the maintenance of favorable intracellular niche to augment their survival and proliferation. In this review, we showcase the lipid-mediated host pathogen interplay in context of life-threatening viral and bacterial diseases including the recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluate the emergent lipid-centric approaches adopted by these pathogens, while delineating the alterations in the composition and organization of the cell membrane within the host, as well as the pathogen. Lastly, crucial nexus points in their interaction landscape for therapeutic interventions are identified. Lipids act as critical determinants of bacterial and viral pathogenesis by altering the host cell membrane structure and functions.

b099a0203256b17924a608afa518ef326e73f012	The COVID-19 pandemic caused a change in our society and put health systems in crisis worldwide. Different risk factors and comorbidities have been found that increase the risk of mortality when acquiring this infection. The use of alternative devices to the cigarette like the electronic cigarettes, the vapers have been studied widely and generators of great controversy since it has been discovered that they also produce different pulmonary affections. When developing the SARS-CoV2 infection, different theories have been generated about the greater predisposition to a worse prognosis of people who use electronic cigarettes; however, the information on this continues in discovery. A group of experts made up of oncologists, infectologists, pulmonologists, and epidemiologists met to review the literature and then generate theories about the impact of electronic cigarettes on SARS-CoV2 infection.
2524c0e98ae8c73ce3b2a2d1838859cfd614c3c9	This book investigates and scrutinizes the lessons learned in the Republic of Korea during a five-decade swath of disasters -from 1948 to 2015 -and results in the disaster response policy change model in the wake of major disasters for resilience building. This book is structured of power-law relation between disaster loss and frequency in Korea from 1948 to 2015, focusing events in the power-law distribution, Disaster-Triggered Policy Change Model, and suggestions for resilient future. To start with the historical review, how to understand disaster throughout the ages was investigated: from an Act of God to Mother Nature's will to societies' inherent risk. As we journey through disaster's history, we start to see the categorization of disasters by cause, principle, and risk -drawing to an understanding of risk through hazard and vulnerability.
a1df82bf1f597170e579a1f0e82f8dfe570c7819	This research has several purposes: First to assess the bacterial and fungal minimum inhibitory concentration of Origanum Syriacum essential oil. Second to quantify its bactericidal and fungicidal minimal concentration against S. aureus, S. mutans, and C. albicans found in denture stomatitis. The third purpose is to look at the influence of three different soils (Annaya, Bhanin and Michrif) on the essential oils composition. Three essential oils were extracted by hydro-distillation from three different Origanum Syriacum plant origins. Bioassays were conducted using a broth microdilution methods. Gas Chromatography analysis was used to calculate the abundance of most components in each essential oil. Post hoc tests assessed antimicrobial effects between ecotypes while Pearson's test correlated the different components and their antimicrobial efficiency (α < 0.05). All tested essential oils were efficient against all microorganisms. Origanum Syriacum essential oils derived from Annaya and Bhanin soils showed a superior antimicrobial activity compared to the Michrif one. The most abundant component and most efficient among all essential oils constituents was carvacrol. It can be concluded that Origanum Syriacum essential oils have an antimicrobial activity, which depends on the ecotype, its origin and its composition. They might be used to start a clinical trial for the treatment of denture stomatitis.

411f5ee838ad5718e47761c7b96c394557b133f4	Background: In Australia, the 2009 epidemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 resulted in increased admissions to intensive care. The annual contribution of influenza to use of intensive care is difficult to estimate, as many people with influenza present without a classic influenza syndrome and laboratory testing may not be performed. We used a population-based approach to estimate and compare the impact of recent epidemics of seasonal and pandemic influenza. Methods: For 2007 to 2010, time series describing health outcomes in various population groups were prepared from a database of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Serfling approach, a time series method, was used to estimate seasonal patterns in health outcomes in the absence of influenza epidemics. The contribution of influenza was estimated by subtracting expected seasonal use from observed use during each epidemic period. Results: The estimated excess rate of influenza-associated respiratory ICU admissions per 100,000 inhabitants was more than three times higher in 2007 (2.6/100,000, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.1) than the pandemic year, 2009 (0.76/100,000, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.48). In 2009, the highest excess respiratory ICU admission rate was in 17 to 64 year olds (2.9/ 100,000, 95% CI 2.2 to 3.6), while in 2007, the highest excess rate was in those aged 65 years or older (9.5/100,000, 95% CI 6.2 to 12.8). In 2009, the excess rate was 17/100,000 (95% CI 14 to 20) in Aboriginal people and 14/100,000 (95% CI 13 to 16) in pregnant women. Conclusion: While influenza was diagnosed more frequently and peak use of intensive care was higher during the epidemic of pandemic influenza in 2009, overall excess admissions to intensive care for respiratory illness was much greater during the influenza season in 2007. Thus, the impact of seasonal influenza on intensive care use may have previously been under-recognised. In 2009, high ICU use among young to middle aged adults was offset by relatively low use among older adults, and Aboriginal people and pregnant women were substantially over-represented in ICUs. Greater emphasis on prevention of serious illness in Aboriginal people and pregnant women should be a priority in pandemic planning.
d3d707e85976bb088c3037683fc1a00fe9b0a32e	The aim of the study was to evaluate the MagNA Pure 96 TM nucleic acid extraction system using clinical respiratory specimens for identifying viruses by qualitative real-time PCR assays. Three extraction methods were tested, that is, the MagNA Pure LC TM , the COBAS Ampliprep TM , and the MagNA Pure 96 TM with 10-fold dilutions of an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 sample. Two hundred thirty-nine respiratory specimens, 35 throat swabs, 164 nasopharyngeal specimens, and 40 broncho-alveolar fluids, were extracted with the MagNA Pure 96 TM and the COBAS Ampliprep TM instruments. Forty COBAS Ampliprep TM positive samples were also tested. Realtime PCRs were used to identify influenza A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. Similar results were obtained on RNA extracted from dilutions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with the three systems: the MagNA Pure LC TM , the COBAS Ampliprep TM , and the MagNA Pure 96 TM . Data from clinical respiratory specimens extracted with the MagNA Pure 96 TM and COBAS Ampliprep TM instruments were in 98.5% in agreement (P < 0.0001) for influenza A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Data for rhinovirus were in 97.3% agreement (P < 0.0001) and in 96.8% agreement for enterovirus. They were in 100% agreement for adenovirus. Data for cytomegalovirus and HSV1-2 were in 95.2% agreement (P < 0.0001). The MagNA Pure 96 TM instrument is easy-to-use, reliable, and has a high throughput for extracting total nucleic acid from respiratory specimens. These extracts are suitable for molecular diagnosis with any type of real-time PCR assay.
2b3b9a9d31a45e4e69cfbc4b01068fc567fc671f	This paper examines the trajectory of witnessing and testimony through modernity, utilizing the notion of 'technologies of trauma'. Such a notion acknowledges humanity's reliance on technologies to transmute history, trauma, or memory, transforming technologies from medium and machine into artefacts for circulation and exchange. The transcendence of medium into artefacts as sites of trauma equally highlights the sociopolitical frames within which testimony is extracted and witnessing is enacted, unleashing trauma as a cultural form and a resonant genre of popular consumption. This paper, in tracing the trajectory of these technologies of trauma and its cultural turn from the sensorial to mass witnessing to the aesthetic regimes of immediacy in the digital age, comes to term with our machinic bind in releasing trauma and its aestheticization as a cultural artefact and the unethical challenges, which unfold in such a proposition. The development of print, photography, television, and digital platforms as technologies of trauma reiterates the popularization of trauma, witnessing and testimony as cultural forms reiterating how these are intimately implicated in our emergence as active consuming communities of trauma and in tandem how these remake us as vulnerable subjects through the circulation of trauma as a cultural form.
2b239fe6cdaea749fbfd5c219b70ceb99ba5a844	We developed a system for rapid determination of viral RNA sequences whereby genomic sequence is obtained from cultured virus isolates without subcloning into plasmid vectors.

f9e51b353d1f30a9dfbb30f0661bffa319c041eb	Background: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is 1 of the 2 most important causes of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves. Surprisingly, field data are scant concerning the prevalence of respiratory pathogens involved in BRD in preweaned dairy calves, especially in small herds. Objectives: To identify the main respiratory pathogens isolated from calves in Qu ebec dairy herds with a high incidence of BRD, and to determine if there is an association between the presence of these pathogens and clinical signs of pneumonia, lung consolidation, or average daily gain. Animals: Cross-sectional study using a convenience sample of 95 preweaned dairy calves from 11 dairy herds. Methods: At enrollment, calves were weighed, clinically examined, swabbed (nasal and nasopharyngeal), and lung ultrasonography was performed. One month later, all calves were reweighed. Results: Twenty-two calves had clinical BRD and 49 had ultrasonographic evidence of lung consolidation. Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Histophilus somni were isolated in 54, 17, and 12 calves, respectively. Mycoplasma bovis was identified by PCR testing or culture in 19 calves, and 78 calves were found to be positive for Mycoplasma spp. Bovine coronavirus was detected in 38 calves and bovine respiratory syncytial virus in 1. Only the presence of M. bovis was associated with higher odds of clinical signs, lung consolidation, and lower average daily gain. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Results suggested that nasopharyngeal carriage of M. bovis was detrimental to health and growth of dairy calves in small herds with a high incidence of BRD.

Objectives: Provide a review of the research literature, propose hypotheses and therapies based on the potential link between testosterone (T) and COVID-19 induced mortality in elderly men. A search of publications in academic electronic databases, and government and public health organization web sites on T, aging, inflammation, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and COVID-19 disease state and outcomes was performed.
c2b5f16729c3dd1b356b0d25814d039192d0c9e5	Since the 2006 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan according to the World Health Organization's recommendation, the Republic of Korea has prepared and periodically evaluated the plan to respond to various public health crises including pandemic influenza. Korea has stockpiled 13,000,000 doses of antiviral drugs covering 26% of the Korean population and runs 519 isolated beds in 16 medical institutions. The division of public health crisis response in Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in charge of responding to public health crises caused by emerging infectious diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza human infection, and pandemic influenza. Its job description includes preparing for emerging infectious diseases, securing medical resources during a crisis, activating the emergency response during the crisis, and fortification of capabilities of public health personnel. It could evolve into a comprehensive national agency to deal with public health crisis based on the experience of previous national emerging infectious diseases.
1dce9aec0132e73ff32c49fad1ef38fa9d4f9958	Over 12 years have elapsed since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) triggered the first global alert for coronavirus infections. Virus transmission in humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have not been observed since. However, other coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection. Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may provide useful recommendations for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against coronavirus infections.
e477c5679fc2dd86c087f828f41a228743aae2f6	Objectives/Hypothesis: Antimalarial drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) are widely used for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, these drugs may have side effects such as hearing loss. This study aimed to describe the hearing function in SLE patients using antimalarials. Secondarily, this study aimed to investigate whether SLE causes hearing loss and if there are any serological or clinical aspects of this diseases associated with inner ear damage. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: This study included 84 individuals (43 SLE patients and 41 controls) with audiometry and tympanometry tests. Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and treatment profiles of SLE patients were extracted from the charts. Results: SLE patients had more sensorineural hearing loss than controls (23.2% vs. 0; P = .001). Pure-tone averages in SLE patients using antimalarials and not using antimalarials were similar (8.75 vs. 8.75; P = .63). At 8,000 Hz, antimalarial dug nonusers performed worse than users (10.00 vs. 22.50; P = .03). Tympanometry was normal in all participants. SLE serological and clinical profiles in patients with and without hearing loss were the same (all P = nonsignificant). Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of hearing loss in SLE that is not affected by antimalarial drug use.
70b3d83ec07c777861d9d8c4504be9d769ba262d	Travel abroad for healthcare has increased rapidly; interventions include organ transplant; cardiac surgery; reproductive care; and joint, cosmetic, and dental procedures. Individuals who receive medical care abroad are a vulnerable, sentinel population, who sample the local environment and can carry home unusual and resistant infections, documented in many reports. Medical tourists are at risk for hospital-associated and procedurerelated infections as well as for locally endemic infections. Patients may not volunteer details about care abroad, so clinicians must inquire about medical procedures abroad as well as recent travel. Special infection control measures may be warranted. Healthcare abroad is associated with diverse financial, legal, ethical, and health-related issues. We focus on problems the infectious disease clinician may encounter and provide a framework for evaluating returned medical tourists with suspected infections. A better system is needed to ensure broad access to high-quality health services, continuity of care, and surveillance for complications.
d544afdb9c39e7a5587c689392230518594b0215	The interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) family inhibits a growing number of pathogenic viruses, among them influenza A virus, dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, and Ebola virus. This review covers recent developments in our understanding of the IFITM's molecular determinants, potential mechanisms of action, and impact on pathogenesis.
b6948375f4dc8ef9ab0ec621b4373cc18bb2bbda	Graphical Abstract Highlights d Autophagy (Atg) genes in myeloid cells inhibit virus-triggered systemic inflammation d Atg gene-regulated systemic inflammation inhibits herpesvirus reactivation d Interferon-g controls herpesvirus reactivation in the setting of Atg gene mutations SUMMARY Host genes that regulate systemic inflammation upon chronic viral infection are incompletely understood. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) infection is characterized by latency in macrophages, and reactivation is inhibited by interferon-g (IFN-g). Using a lysozyme-M-cre (LysMcre) expression system, we show that deletion of autophagy-related (Atg) genes Fip200, beclin 1, Atg14, Atg16l1, Atg7, Atg3, and Atg5, in the myeloid compartment, inhibited MHV68 reactivation in macrophages. Atg5 deficiency did not alter reactivation from B cells, and effects on reactivation from macrophages were not explained by alterations in productive viral replication or the establishment of latency. Rather, chronic MHV68 infection triggered increased systemic inflammation, increased T cell production of IFN-g, and an IFN-g-induced transcriptional signature in macrophages from Atg gene-deficient mice. The Atg5-related reactivation defect was partially reversed by neutralization of IFN-g. Thus Atg genes in myeloid cells dampen virus-induced systemic inflammation, creating an environment that fosters efficient MHV68 reactivation from latency.
aeffce826c728bdd599dd0af15fd88b91d4c9421	• We investigate the relationship between policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and stock market volatility. • We explore several different non-pharmaceutical interventions in 67 countries. • Stringent policy responses increase return volatility in international stock markets. • The effect is independent from the role of the coronavirus pandemic itself and is robust to many considerations. • Information campaigns and public event cancellations are the major contributors to the growth of volatility. Do government interventions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 affect stock market volatility? To answer this question, we explore the stringency of policy responses to the novel coronavirus pandemic in 67 countries around the world. We demonstrate that non-pharmaceutical interventions significantly increase equity market volatility. The effect is independent from the role of the coronavirus pandemic itself and is robust to many considerations. Furthermore, two types of actions that are usually applied chronologically particularly early-information campaigns and public event cancellations-are the major contributors to the growth of volatility.
aa0cd876635a216f6679b3d319c180928294a3d6	Most of the success of electronic devices fabricated to actively interact with a biological environment relies on the proper choice of materials and efficient engineering of surfaces and interfaces. Organic materials have proved to be among the best candidates for this aim owing to many properties, such as the synthesis tunability, processing, softness and self-assembling ability, which allow them to form surfaces that are compatible with biological tissues. This review reports some research results obtained in the development of devices which exploit organic materials' properties in order to detect biologically significant molecules as well as to trigger/capture signals from the biological environment. Among the many investigated sensing devices, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and microcantilevers (MCLs) have been chosen. The main factors motivating this choice are their label-free detection approach, which is particularly important when addressing complex biological processes, as well as the possibility to integrate them in an electronic circuit. Particular attention is paid to the design and realization of biocompatible surfaces which can be employed in the recognition of pertinent molecules as well as to the research of new materials, both natural and inspired by nature, as a first approach to environmentally friendly electronics.
901b848b28f58d2fa58664af86f2e6d6229ea4a0	Allergic respiratory disorders, in particular asthma are increasing in prevalence, which is a global phenomenon. Even though genetic predisposition is one of the factors in children for the increased prevalence -urbanisation, air pollution and environmental tobacco smoke contribute more significantly. Our hospital based study on 20,000 children under the age of 18 years from 1979, 1984, 1989, 1994 and 1999 in the city of Bangalore showed a prevalence of 9%, 10.5%, 18.5%, 24.5% and 29.5% respectively. The increased prevalence correlated well with demographic changes of the city. Further to the hospital study, a school survey in 12 schools on 6550 children in the age group of 6 to 15 years was undertaken for prevalence of asthma and children were categorized into three groups depending upon the geographical situation of the school in relation to vehicular traffic and the socioeconomic group of children. Group I-Children from schools of heavy traffic area showed prevalence of 19.34%, Group I I-Children from heavy traffic region and low socioeconomic population had 31.14% and Group Ill-Children from low traffic area school had 11.15% respectively. (P: I & II; II & III <0.001). A continuation of study in rural areas showed 5.7% in children of 6-15 years. The persistent asthma also showed an increase from 20% to 27.5% and persistent severe asthma 4% to 6.5% between 1994-99. Various epidemiological spectra of asthma in children are discussed here.

9cc591eb1903222df81c3777e6ab07fb9c38814c	Body temperatures are less likely to reach the fever range in the morning, 1,2 but it is unknown how this affects practice during disease outbreaks. We retrospectively investigated fever-range temperatures (≥100.4°F, ≥38.0°C) during seasonal influenza outbreaks and the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, which have recently been used as preparatory models for coronavirus disease 2019 . Our analyses included a nationally representative sample of records from adult visits to US emergency departments (n=202,181) and data from a Boston emergency department (n=93,225). Fever-range temperatures were about half as common in the morning as in the evening, suggesting that morning temperatures can be much less diagnostic, and that revisions may be needed to the practice of once-daily temperature screens at morning arrival to workplaces and schools. Twice-daily screens could be a simple solution, but similar research is still needed on fevers in COVID-19 itself. : Temperatures (n=115,149) were collected during triages at a Boston adult emergency department to monitor outbreaks (September 2009-March 2012). 2,3 We also investigated adult triage temperatures (n=218,574) from a nationally representative study of US emergency department visits (December 2002-December 2010). 4 The thermometer types used were temporal artery (Boston) and a nationally representative sample (national). We excluded records missing temperature or time (Boston=1.0%, national=7.5%), or indicating repeated or accidental measurement (repeated ≤15 seconds or temperature <95°F: Boston=18.0%), leaving 93,225 Boston and 202,181 national temperatures for analysis. 2 Highinfluenza activity periods were defined as months that fully exceeded CDC ILINet baseline thresholds in region 1 (Boston analysis; outbreak-period n=6627) or nationally (national analysis; outbreak-period n=29,908). 5 We accounted for the national study's multistage design to obtain nationally representative findings. 6 For the national study, time-of-day case mix differences in sex (male or female), age (years, analyzed with spline), urgency/immediacy of case (4 levels and unknown), pain (4 levels and unknown), race (black, white, or other), Hispanic or Latino ancestry (yes or no), hospital admission (yes or no), test ordering (yes, no, or unknown), procedure administration (yes, no, or unknown), medication ordering (yes, no, or unknown), ambulance arrival (yes, no, or unknown), and expected payment source (7 levels and unknown) were excluded as responsible factors for the time-of-day fever rate differences using multivariable logistic regression with a quasibinomial error distribution and average marginal predictions. 4,7 Anonymity : medRxiv preprint Preprint -Fevers rare in the morning Our research extends a previous study that did not analyze outbreaks, but provides more details on methods, summarizes patient demographics, examines selection and other potential biases, demonstrates the robustness of findings to exclusion criteria changes (useful because many exclusions were made in Boston

2407834245c872e91a78cdb9bd63ac8f81a49231	Diet-induced obesity is associated with systemic inflammation, which is considered to originate predominantly from the adipose tissue. Quercetin and resveratrol are two dietary polyphenols that exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and anti-insulin resistance when administered in isolation or combination (CQR). It remains unknown whether CQR reduces high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and inflammation in rats. In the current study, 46 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups, one of which was fed a normal diet (ND, 5.4% fat, w/w) and one of which was fed a HFD (45% fat, w/w) for 3 weeks. Following removal of the 12 most obesity-resistant rats from the HFD group, the remaining rats were divided into two sub-groups: A HFD group and a HFD+CQR group (administered 120 mg/kg/day resveratrol and 240 mg/kg/day quercetin). The results revealed that the HFD+CQR group had significantly lower body weights at 11 weeks compared with the HFD group and had significantly reduced visceral adipose tissue weights and adipocyte sizes. Serum lipid profiles were also significantly ameliorated in the HFD+CQR group. CQR attenuated the expression of systemic proinflammatory adipokines, including leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6. It also reduced the recruitment of mast cells to the epididyotic adipose tissue (EAT). Furthermore, CQR reversed the HFD-induced suppression of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1) phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression in EAT. In conclusion, CQR may suppress obesity and associated inflammation via the AMPKα1/SIRT1 signaling pathway in rats fed a HFD.
7d19924d711c80a4c62a0289bf30dff5f44b8c35	The extent to which citizens comply with newly enacted public health measures such as social distancing or lockdowns strongly affects the propagation of the virus and the number of deaths from COVID-19. It is however very difficult to identify non-compliance through survey research because claiming to follow the rules is socially desirable. Using three survey experiments, we examine the efficacy of different 'face-saving' questions that aim to reduce social desirability in the measurement of compliance with public health measures. Our treatments soften the social norm of compliance by way of a short preamble in combination with a guilty-free answer choice making it easier for respondents to admit non-compliance. We find that self-reported non-compliance increases by up to 11 percentage points when making use of a face-saving question. Considering the current context and the importance of measuring non-compliance, we argue that researchers around the world should adopt our most efficient face-saving question.
44557db9dce19a72a599007f5a5c00ac8e031a79	We study whether humans or machine learning (ML) classification models are better at classifying scientific research abstracts according to a fixed set of discipline groups. We recruit both undergraduate and postgraduate assistants for this task in separate stages, and compare their performance against the support vectors machine ML algorithm at classifying European Research Council Starting Grant project abstracts to their actual evaluation panels, which are organised by discipline groups. On average, ML is more accurate than human classifiers, across a variety of training and test datasets, and across evaluation panels. ML classifiers trained on different training sets are also more reliable than human classifiers, meaning that different ML classifiers are more consistent in assigning the same classifications to any given abstract, compared to different human classifiers. While the top five percentile of human classifiers can outperform ML in limited cases, selection and training of such classifiers is likely costly and difficult compared to training ML models. Our results suggest ML models are a cost effective and highly accurate method for addressing problems in comparative bibliometric analysis, such as harmonising the discipline classifications of research from different funding agencies or countries.
cae1f2fd5785845caa42d6497361eba46a68f11d	Diversity and plasticity are two hallmarks of macrophages. M1 macrophages (classically activated macrophages) are pro-inflammatory and have a central role in host defense against infection, while M2 macrophages (alternatively activated macrophages) are associated with responses to anti-inflammatory reactions and tissue remodeling, and they represent two terminals of the full spectrum of macrophage activation. Transformation of different phenotypes of macrophages regulates the initiation, development, and cessation of inflammatory diseases. Here we reviewed the characters and functions of macrophage polarization in infection, atherosclerosis, obesity, tumor, asthma, and sepsis, and proposed that targeting macrophage polarization and skewing their phenotype to adapt to the microenvironment might hold great promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
beed702171ee8c9968e3b1c38b0feba35af742dc	Most pandemics-eg, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenzaoriginate in animals, are caused by viruses, and are driven to emerge by ecological, behavioural, or socioeconomic changes. Despite their substantial effects on global public health and growing understanding of the process by which they emerge, no pandemic has been predicted before infecting human beings. We review what is known about the pathogens that emerge, the hosts that they originate in, and the factors that drive their emergence. We discuss challenges to their control and new efforts to predict pandemics, target surveillance to the most crucial interfaces, and identify prevention strategies. New mathematical modelling, diagnostic, communications, and informatics technologies can identify and report hitherto unknown microbes in other species, and thus new risk assessment approaches are needed to identify microbes most likely to cause human disease. We lay out a series of research and surveillance opportunities and goals that could help to overcome these challenges and move the global pandemic strategy from response to pre-emption.
3bf0902346541d9c58458ab14fc97d2f95e2f63d	Background: The current study explored the prevalence of depressed mood among Chinese undergraduate students and examined the coping patterns and degree of flexibility of flexibility of such patterns associated with such mood. Methods: A set of questionnaire assessing coping patterns, coping flexibility, and depressive symptoms were administered to 428 students (234 men and 194 women). Results: A total of 266 participants both completed the entire set of questionnaires and reported a frequency of two or more stressful life events (the criterion needed to calculate variance in perceived controllability). Findings showed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher levels of both event frequency (r = .368, p < .001) and event impact (r = .245, p < .001) and lower levels of perceived controllability (r = -.261, p < .001), coping effectiveness (r = -.375, p < .001), and ratio of strategy to situation fit (r = -.108, p < .05). Depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with cognitive flexibility (variance of perceived controllability; r = .031, p = .527), Gender was not a significant moderator of any of the reported associations. Conclusions: Findings indicate that Chinese university students with depressive symptoms reported experiencing a greater number of negative events than did non-depressed university students. In addition, undergraduates with depressive symptoms were more likely than other undergraduates to utilize maladaptive coping methods. Such findings highlight the potential importance of interventions aimed at helping undergraduate students with a lower coping flexibility develop skills to cope with stressful life events.
b153ef1a7cb22199b3f2e8901d25a93acf2c7570	The clinical evaluation of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the current outbreak, predominantly affecting Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, was prioritized by the World Health Organization in September 2014. In each of these countries, nonrandomized comparative clinical trials were initiated. The Ebola-Tx trial in Conakry, Guinea, enrolled 102 patients by 7 July 2015; no severe adverse reactions were noted. The Ebola-CP trial in Sierra Leone and the EVD001 trial in Liberia have included few patients. Although no efficacy data are available yet, current field experience supports the safety, acceptability, and feasibility of CP as EVD treatment. Longer-term follow-up as well as data from nontrial settings and evidence on the scalability of the intervention are required. CP sourced from within the outbreak is the most readily available source of anti-EVD antibodies. Until the advent of effective antivirals or monoclonal antibodies, CP merits further evaluation.
31b036bd6ae0cfd30574b1b7aa39d7e9f35d8c86	At the moment, little treatment options are available for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to a complex cascade of pathogenic events in myofibres, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as altered metabolism. The attention towards dietary supplements in DMD is rapidly increasing, with the aim to counteract pathology-related alteration in nutrient intake, the consequences of catabolic distress or to enhance the immunological response of patients as nowadays for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. By definition, supplements do not exert therapeutic actions, although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds. For most supplements, little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in DMD as well as their preventing actions against infections. Often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients/caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team. Then, little is known about the real extent of supplement use in DMD patients. It is mistakenly assumed that, since compounds are of natural origin, if a supplement is not effective, it will also do no harm. However, supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions, in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity, with other therapies. It is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients. This review discusses the supplements mostly used by DMD patients, focusing on their potential toxicity, due to a variety of mechanisms including pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions and contaminations, as well as on reports of adverse events. This overview underlines the need for caution in uncontrolled use of dietary supplements in fragile populations such as DMD patients. A culture of appropriate use has to be implemented between clinicians and patients' groups.
d9295ce0c9db088d9d8b35855016becbad9865c8	In this paper, we discuss the mechanisation of some fundamental propositional modal model theory. The focus on models is novel: previous work in mechanisations of modal logic have centered on proof systems and applications in model-checking. We have mechanised a number of fundamental results from the first two chapters of a standard textbook (Blackburn et al. [1] ). Among others, one important result, the Van Benthem characterisation theorem, characterises the connection between modal logic and first order logic. This latter captures the desired saturation property of ultraproduct models on countably incomplete ultrafilters.
3e8c8e7704892bc4afc45e9801d515baac8f045a	Prevention of renal failure: The Malaysian experience. Renal replacement therapy in Malaysia has shown exponential growth since 1990. The dialysis acceptance rate for 2003 was 80 per million population, prevalence 391 per million population. There are now more than 10,000 patients on dialysis. This growth is proportional to the growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Improvement in nephrology and urology services with widespread availability of ultrasonography and renal pathology has improved care of renal patients. Proper management of renal stone disease, lupus nephritis, and acute renal failure has decreased these as causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in younger age groups. Older patients are being accepted for dialysis, and 51% of new patients on dialysis were diabetic in 2003. The prevalence of diabetes is rising in the country (presently 7%); glycemic control of such patients is suboptimal. Thirtythree percent of adult Malaysians are hypertensive and blood pressure control is poor (6%). There is a national coordinating committee to oversee the control of diabetes and hypertension in the country. Primary care clinics have been provided with kits to detect microalbuminuria, and ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Prevention of renal failure workshops targeted at primary care doctors have been launched, opportunistic screening at health clinics is being carried out, and public education targeting high-risk groups is ongoing. The challenge in Malaysia is to stem the rising tide of diabetic ESRD.
39683dd78bcf6b301cbed610b6e3213a5ce33380	, an algae-derived lectin, is one of the most potent viral entry inhibitors discovered to date. It is currently being developed as a microbicide with broad-spectrum activity against several enveloped viruses. GRFT can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at picomolar concentrations, surpassing the ability of most anti-HIV agents. The potential to inhibit other viruses as well as parasites has also been demonstrated. Griffithsin's antiviral activity stems from its ability to bind terminal mannoses present in high-mannose oligosaccharides and crosslink these glycans on the surface of the viral envelope glycoproteins. Here, we review structural and biochemical studies that established mode of action and facilitated construction of GRFT analogs, mechanisms that may lead to resistance, and in vitro and pre-clinical results that support the therapeutic potential of this lectin.
423b4caa8cd501058a3db47c131c94422b02cb6c	and MN566362-MN566421 (mitochondrial control region, HVR1). Over evolutionary time, pathogen challenge shapes the immune phenotype of the host to better respond to an incipient threat. The extent and direction of this selection pressure depend on the local pathogen composition, which is in turn determined by biotic and abiotic features of the environment. However, little is known about adaptation to local pathogen threats in wild animals. The Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) is a species complex that lends itself to the study of immune adaptation because of its circumpolar distribution over a large latitudinal range, with little or no admixture between different clades. In this study, we examine the diversity in a key family of innate immune genes-the Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-across the range of the Gentoo penguin. The three TLRs that we investigated present varying levels of diversity, with TLR4 and TLR5 greatly exceeding the diversity of TLR7. We present evidence of positive selection in TLR4 and TLR5, which points to pathogen-driven adaptation to the local pathogen milieu. Finally, we demonstrate that two positively selected cosegregating sites in TLR5 are sufficient to alter the responsiveness of the receptor to its bacterial ligand, flagellin. Taken together, these results suggest that Gentoo penguins have experienced distinct pathogen-driven selection pressures in different environments, which may be important given the role of the Gentoo penguin as a sentinel species in some of the world's most rapidly changing environments.
fdd8dfcb3e862e5afe92461ba75d02f4ac5e94e4	Gene transfer to airway epithelia with amphotropic pseudotyped retroviral vectors is inefficient following apical vector application. To better understand this inefficiency, we localized the expression of Pit2, the amphotropic receptor, in polarized human airway epithelia. Pit2 was expressed on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cells, suggesting that factors other than receptor abundance may limit apical gene transfer efficiency. Binding studies performed with radiolabeled amphotropic MuLV suggested that the apically applied virus binds to Pit2. Hypothetical barriers to retroviral gene transfer include the apical glycocalyx and other secreted products of epithelia. In this study, we demonstrated that sialic acid, keratan sulfate and collagen type V are present on the apical surface of well-differentiated human airway epithelia. While enzyme treatment reduced
ebf248c9fc0a1a23d1778b94083319aa995e34f4	During the course of an epidemic of a potentially fatal disease, it is important that the case fatality ratio be well estimated. The authors propose a novel method for doing so based on the Kaplan-Meier survival procedure, jointly considering two outcomes (death and recovery), and evaluate its performance by using data from the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong, People's Republic of China. They compare this estimate obtained at various points in the epidemic with the case fatality ratio eventually observed; with two commonly quoted, naïve estimates derived from cumulative incidence and mortality statistics at single time points; and with estimates in which a parametric mixture model is used. They demonstrate the importance of patient characteristics regarding outcome by analyzing subgroups defined by age at admission to the hospital. case-fatality ratio; Kaplan-Meier estimator; SARS virus; survival analysis Abbreviation: SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.
fefe1c696af14574381221f665ec41579f8b6160	Objectives: High-quality meta-analyses on COVID-19 are in urgent demand for evidence-based decision making. However, conventional approaches exclude double-zero-event studies (DZS) from meta-analyses. We assessed whether including such studies impacts the conclusions in a recent systematic urgent review on prevention measures for preventing person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. We extracted data for meta-analyses containing DZS from a recent review that assessed the effects of physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection for preventing person-to-person transmission. A bivariate generalized linear mixed model was used to re-do the meta-analyses with DZS included. We compared the synthesized relative risks (RRs) of the three prevention measures, their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and significance tests (at the level of 0.05) including and excluding DZS. The re-analyzed COVID-19 data containing DZS involved a total of 1,784 participants who were not considered in the original review. Including DZS noticeably changed the synthesized RRs and 95% CIs of several interventions. For the meta-analysis of the effect of physical distancing, the RR of COVID-19 decreased from 0.15 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.73) to 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.98). For several meta-analyses, the statistical significance of the synthesized RR was changed. The RR of eye protection with a physical distance of 2 m and the RR of physical distancing when using N95 respirators were no longer statistically significant after including DZS. Conclusions: DZS may contain useful information. Sensitivity analyses that include DZS in meta-analysis are recommended.
a613d8d7267d15c258be90a313a47fd2f83f4a6d	Rationale Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the major triggers of asthma exacerbations. We have shown previously that lower respiratory tract symptoms, airflow obstruction, and neutrophilic airway inflammation were increased in experimental RV-induced asthma exacerbations. Objectives We hypothesized that neutrophil-related CXC chemokines and antimicrobial peptides are increased and related to clinical, virologic, and pathologic outcomes in RV-induced exacerbations of asthma. Methods Protein levels of antimicrobial peptides (SLPI, HNP 1-3, elafin, and LL-37) and neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1/GRO-a, CXCL2/GRO-b, CXCL5/ENA-78, CXCL6/GCP-2, CXCL7/NAP-2, and CXCL8/IL-8) were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 10 asthmatics and 15 normal controls taken before, at day four during and 6 weeks post-experimental infection. Results BAL HNP 1-3 and Elafin were higher, CXCL7/NAP-2 was lower in asthmatics compared with controls at day 4 (P = 0.035, P = 0.048, and P = 0.025, respectively). BAL HNP 1-3 and CXCL8/IL-8 were increased during infection (P = 0.003 and P = 0.011, respectively). There was a trend to increased BAL neutrophils at day 4 compared with baseline (P = 0.076). BAL HNP 1-3 was positively correlated with BAL neutrophil numbers at day 4. There were no correlations between clinical parameters and HNP1-3 or IL-8 levels. Conclusions We propose that RV infection in asthma leads to increased release of CXCL8/ IL-8, attracting neutrophils into the airways where they release HNP 1-3, which further enhances airway neutrophilia. Strategies to inhibit CXCL8/IL-8 may be useful in treatment of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.
7d3433e24237e0921a0649b601d71a346ac42f3f	The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic poses an enormous challenge to healthcare systems in affected communities. Older patients and those with pre-existing medical conditions have been identified as populations at risk of a severe disease course. It remains unclear at this point to what extent chronic liver diseases should be considered as risk factors, due to a shortage of appropriate studies. However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention. Thus, the challenge hepatologists are facing is to promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritise outpatient contacts, avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers, and at the same time maintain standard care for patients who require immediate medical attention.
ceab18d97f09ef0d9030f0c808f7ab5ab1c7d583	Regulation of gene expression is one of several roles proposed for the stress-induced nucleotide diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap 4 A). We have examined this directly by a comparative RNA-Seq analysis of KBM-7 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and KBM-7 cells in which the NUDT2 Ap 4 A hydrolase gene had been disrupted (NuKO cells), causing a 175fold increase in intracellular Ap 4 A. 6,288 differentially expressed genes were identified with P < 0.05. Of these, 980 were up-regulated and 705 down-regulated in NuKO cells with a fold-change 2. Ingenuity 1 Pathway Analysis (IPA 1 ) was used to assign these genes to known canonical pathways and functional networks. Pathways associated with interferon responses, pattern recognition receptors and inflammation scored highly in the down-regulated set of genes while functions associated with MHC class II antigens were prominent among the up-regulated genes, which otherwise showed little organization into major functional gene sets. Tryptophan catabolism was also strongly down-regulated as were numerous genes known to be involved in tumor promotion in other systems, with roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conversely, some pro-apoptotic genes were up-regulated. Major upstream factors predicted by IPA 1 for gene down-regulation included NFκB, STAT1/2, IRF3/4 and SP1 but no major factors controlling gene up-regulation were identified. Potential mechanisms for gene regulation mediated by Ap 4 A and/or NUDT2 disruption include binding of Ap 4 A to the HINT1 co-repressor, autocrine activation of purinoceptors by Ap 4 A, chromatin remodeling, effects of NUDT2 loss on transcript stability, and inhibition of ATP-dependent regulatory factors such as protein kinases by Ap 4 A. Existing evidence favors the last of these as the most probable mechanism. Regardless, our results suggest that the NUDT2 protein could be a novel cancer chemotherapeutic target, with its inhibition potentially exerting strong anti-tumor effects via multiple pathways involving metastasis, invasion, immunosuppression and apoptosis.
021e99ceee0d05b45cec42257e5bf47b0e75bed7	Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increased interest in telehealth as a means of providing care for children by a pediatric cardiologist. In this article, we provide an overview of telehealth utilization as an extension of current pediatric cardiology practices and provide some insight into the rapid shift made to quickly implement these telehealth services into our everyday practices due to COVID-19 personal distancing requirements. Our panel will review helpful tips into the selection of appropriate patient populations and specific cardiac diagnoses for telehealth that put patient and family safety concerns first. Numerous practical considerations in conducting a telehealth visit must be taken into account to ensure optimal use of this technology. The use of adapted staffing and billing models and expanded means of remote monitoring will aid in the incorporation of telehealth into more widespread pediatric cardiology practice. Future directions to sustain this platform include the refinement of telehealth care strategies, defining best practices, including telehealth in the fellowship curriculum and continuing advocacy for technology.
c6518c58374cc315647f2873a234cfa983746bfd	Background: Developments in DNA resequencing microarrays include mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and mutation detection. Failure by the microarray to identify a base, compared to the reference sequence, is designated an 'N-call.' This study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions (indels) in mtDNA. Findings: We analysed 16 patient mtDNA samples using MitoChip. N-calls by the proprietary GSEQ software were significantly reduced when either of the freeware on-line algorithms ResqMi or sPROFILER was utilized. With sPROFILER, this decrease in N-calls had no effect on the homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mutation levels compared to GSEQ software, but ResqMi produced a significant change in mutation load, as well as producing longer N-cell stretches. For these reasons, further analysis using ResqMi was not attempted. Conventional DNA sequencing of the longer N-calls stretches from sPROFILER revealed 7 insertions and 12 point mutations. Moreover, analysis of single-base N-calls of one mtDNA sample found 3 other point mutations. Conclusions: Our study is the first to analyse N-calls produced from GSEQ software for the MitoChipv2.0. By narrowing the focus to longer stretches of N-calls revealed by sPROFILER, conventional sequencing was able to identify unique insertions and point mutations. Shorter N-calls also harboured point mutations, but the absence of deletions among N-calls suggests that probe confirmation affects binding and thus N-calling. This study supports the contention that the GSEQ is more capable of assigning bases when used in conjunction with sPROFILER.
df9afad4d87895e2d96f9bc674015caf84ee00e5	Tumour necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣) has been shown to play a role in many inflammatory conditions. Currently anti-TNF-␣ drugs (e.g. etanercept) are used in humans for treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of TNF-␣ in the development of virus-endotoxin-induced respiratory disease. Twenty-two caesarean derived colostrum deprived pigs were used. Initially, the availability in the lungs and circulation, and possible clinical and inflammatory effects of etanercept alone were assessed in 4 pigs after intratracheal and intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 mg/per route/per pig. High anti-TNF-␣ activity was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, peritoneal lavage fluids and serum of all animals for at least 8 h post-inoculation (HPI). No clinical symptoms, lung lesions, lung cell infiltration or induction of IFN-␣, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-␣ in BAL were detected. Subsequently, the ability of etanercept to block porcine TNF-␣ and its effect on the above mentioned parameters and on lung virus titres were assessed in 8 pigs. They were inoculated intratracheally with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 h later. Etanercept was administered at the time of LPS inoculation via the same routes and dose as in the initial experiment. The parameters were compared with a control group (n = 8), receiving only PRCV-LPS. Half of the animals from each group were euthanized at 4 and the rest at 8 h after LPS inoculation. TNF-␣ was completely neutralized in 3 of the 4 animals euthanized at 4 HPI and significantly lower than in the PRCV-LPS group at all times. No significant differences in disease severity, lung lesions, virus replication, lung cell infiltration or levels of IFN-␣, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23 were observed between the two groups. Blocking of TNF-␣ alone was not sufficient to ameliorate disease in the PRCV-LPS model of respiratory disease, possibly due to the redundancy in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, or the involvement of other unidentified disease mediators.
045d35854a4f92e409d47b7fb5598dec1a877112	The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the essential role of chest computed tomography (CT) examination in patient triage in the emergency departments, allowing them to be referred to "COVID" or "non-COVID" wards. Initial chest CT examination must be performed without intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material, but contrast material administration is required when pulmonary embolism is suspected, which seems to be frequent in severe forms of the disease. Typical CT features consist of bilateral ground-glass Page 2 of 13 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 opacities with peripheral, posterior and basal predominance.

23c64b50d573abcf36a003fb6334633b3f0ab8ce	Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease. Method: Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDI vol ), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. Result: There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazypaving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDI vol , DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p < 0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group. (Continued on next page)

In the majority of patients, however, genital complaints seem not to be the initial or sole symptoms. In this article, we report an unusual presentation of a male case with severe external genital pain which was suspected to be the first clinical sign of COVID-19.
baf4dc7d099d0bca01aa58428627c9b7b3b0c1a5	The current treatments offered to patients with chronic respiratory diseases are being re-evaluated based on the loss of potency during long-term treatments or because they only provide significant clinical benefits to a subset of the patient population. For instance, glucocorticoids are considered the most effective anti-inflammatory therapies for chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, such as asthma. But they are relatively ineffective in asthmatic smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis (CF). As such, the pharmaceutical industry is exploring new therapeutic approaches to address all major respiratory diseases. The previous chapters demonstrated the widespread influence of purinergic signaling on all pulmonary functions and defense mechanisms. In Chap. 8, we described animal studies which highlighted the critical role of aberrant purinergic activities in the development and maintenance of chronic airway diseases. This last chapter covers all clinical and pharmaceutical applications currently developed based on purinergic receptor agonists and antagonists. We use the information acquired in the previous chapters on purinergic signaling and lung functions to scrutinize the preclinical and clinical data, and to realign the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry.

Los factores ambientales e infecciosos han sido fuertemente asociados al incremento de la ocurrencia de la enfermedad, hasta más del doble, en los últimos 10 años. En este artículo de revisión se describen los principales hallazgos reportados sobre la relación entre ciertas infecciones virales y bacterianas con la aparición y progresión de la EM. Métodos: Se realizó un plan metodológico de búsqueda de artículos científicos relacionados con infección y EM, mediante la búsqueda de artículos científicos, principalmente publicados en inglés, en las plataformas virtuales de Pubmed, Medline y Cochrane. Para la búsqueda se utilizaron como palabras claves (términos MeSH): «virus, bacteria, autoimmune disease of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis». Se eligieron artículos publicados en revistas indexadas durante los últimos 15 años. Resultados: Estudios epidemiológicos sugieren que la EM tiene un componente etiológico infeccioso que origina un proceso inflamatorio que puede contribuir a la iniciación o exacerbación de la enfermedad. Particularmente, la infección viral y los eventos de desmielinización en el SNC puede deberse a la penetración de un virus como el virus Epstein-Barr (EBV), a través del torrente sanguíneo, específicamente hacia el SNC. Por otro lado, las infecciones bacterianas crónicas pueden causar procesos de desmielinización en el SNC que agravan la enfermedad de EM. * Autor para correspondencia.

Multiple sclerosis a b s t r a c t Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Environmental and infectious factors had been strongly associated and involved in the increased occurrence of MS, to more than twice, in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the main findings on the relationship between viral and bacterial infections and the onset and progression of MS. Methods: The research involved a systematic review of scientific literature regarding infection and MS. Our search was performed using and consulting specialized websites like PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. The keywords (MeSH terms) employed for the digital search were: "virus, bacteria, autoimmune disease of the nervous system, and multiple sclerosis." Articles published in English indexed journals during the past 15 years were used for the study. Results: Epidemiological studies suggest that MS has an infectious etiologic component causing an inflammatory process that may contribute to the initiation and/or exacerbation of the disease. Particularly, viral infections and demyelination events in the CNS may be due to the penetration of viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) through the bloodstream to the CNS, specifically. On the other hand, chronic bacterial infections may cause demyelination processes that trigger or increase the complications of the disease in MS. Conclusions: This study shows the multiple factors involved in the occurrence of MS. More epidemiological studies are necessary to support the relationship and involvement of viral and bacterial infections in the onset, development and severity of the disease.

50a6f89efdfcdfe282fbedf4d679e9b4fff30cac	High oxygen tension in blood and/or tissue affects clinical outcomes in several diseases. Thus, the optimal target PaO 2 for patients recovering from cardiac arrest (CA) has been extensively examined. Many patients develop hypoxic brain injury after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); this supports the need for oxygen administration in patients after CA. Insufficient oxygen delivery due to decreased blood flow to cerebral tissue during CA results in hypoxic brain injury. By contrast, hyperoxia may increase dissolved oxygen in the blood and, subsequently, generate reactive oxygen species that are harmful to neuronal cells. This secondary brain injury is particularly concerning. Although several clinical studies demonstrated that hyperoxia during post-CA care was associated with poor neurological outcomes, considerable debate is ongoing because of inconsistent results. Potential reasons for the conflicting results include differences in the definition of hyperoxia, the timing of exposure to hyperoxia, and PaO 2 values used in analyses. Despite the conflicts, exposure to PaO 2 > 300 mmHg through administration of unnecessary oxygen should be avoided because no obvious benefit has been demonstrated. The feasibility of titrating oxygen administration by targeting SpO 2 at approximately 94% in patients recovering from CA has been demonstrated in pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Such protocols should be further examined.
dd363767c8badb78edbd3febc2ae81fc466e33a2	Background Sleep services are assigned a non-essential status during COVID-19. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine strongly urges sleep clinicians to continue postponing non-urgent care until a later date, if such a recommendation is made by state officials due to local conditions. At the same time, one cannot ignore the fact that sleep is important for people's health and wellbeing. Therefore, to protect the health of the population, it is essential to find ways and means to continue the practice of sleep medicine even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Social environment and work ethics in sleep clinics and sleep laboratories in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are different from those in the US. Under these circumstances, the Indian Society for Sleep Research (ISSR) created a task force to develop guidelines for the practice of sleep medicine, not only for the Indian environment but also for other countries that are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force examined documents regarding practice of sleep medicine and associated specialities during COVID-19 by various professional organizations and governmental authorities. The recommendations were examined for their applicability. Wherever gaps were identified, consensus was reached keeping in view the available evidences. The emphasis of the guidelines is on avoiding doctor to patient contact during the pandemic. Teleconsultation and other modes of audio-visuals can be used as modes for medical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in addition to the patient, the presence of a family member, or a reliable informant is recommended. Patients of most sleep disorders can be provided tele-aftercare service. ISSR guidelines also give a list of medications allowed to be prescribed during the first and the follow-up teleconsultation. Hospitals and clinics are slowly opening in India and many other countries. As sleep services resume operations, there is a need to find innovative ways to reduce contact with COVID-19 patients, follow personal protection guidelines, as well as social distancing. This article does discuss strategies for the safe conduct of Level 1 sleep studies. Home sleep testing, which had greater acceptance during the last few years, should be given more attention during the COVID-19 period. Once the decision to reopen the sleep laboratory and resume operations is made, the safety of the patients and office staff should become the major priority. The ISSR recommendation is to postpone and reschedule in-laboratory positive pressure therapy, but it mentions the considerations to be followed in emergency situations. At the same time, high clinical risk patients may be diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings, and without performing polysomnography or home sleep testing. However, at some point, there is a need to reinitiate the in-lab testing. In addition, daily assessment of the COVID-19 situation in the community, along with a review of the situation with local public health and the state health department is advised.
57b0a65d4333f7345ab716001308e70e3b3df64c	classified as a member of the genus coronavirus in the family coronaviridae. The enveloped virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 28 kilo-bases, which has a 5 cap structure and 3 polyadenylation tract. The complete genome sequence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Beijing isolate, was determined by cloning sequencing and primer walking. The whole genome is 27733 nucleotides in length, has ten open reading frames: 5 -orf1a-orf1ab-s-3a-3b-e-m-6a-6b-n-3 . Alignments of the genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate with those of two AIBV strains and one SARS coronavirus were performed respectively. The genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate compared with that of the IBV strain LX4 (uncompleted, 19440 bp in size) was 91.2% similarity. However, the full-length genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate was 85.2% identity to that of IBV Strain Beaudette, and was only 50.8% homology to that of SARS coronavirus. The results showed that the genome of IBV has remarkable variation. And IBV Beijing isolate is not closely related to SARS coronavirus. Phylogenetic analyses based on the whole genome sequence, S protein, M protein and N protein, also showed that AIBV Beijing isolate is lone virus in group and is distant from SARS coronavirus. In conclusion, this study will contribute to the studies of diagnosis and diseases control on IBV in China. Keywords: avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), primer walking, sequence analysis.
ebd0a7f4271d53155a827a93603ca5fe51f29c5a	RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of gene silencing induced by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Among the widely used dsRNAs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs have evolved as extremely powerful and the most popular gene silencing reagents. The key challenge to achieving effi cient gene silencing especially for the purpose of therapeutics is mainly dependent on the effectiveness and specifi city of the selected RNAi-targeted sequences. Practically, only a small number of dsRNAs are capable of inducing highly effective and sequence-specifi c gene silencing via RNAi mechanism. In addition, the effi ciency of gene silencing induced by dsRNAs can only be experimentally examined based on inhibition of the target gene expression. Therefore, it is essential to develop a fully robust and comparative validation system for measuring the effi cacy of designed dsRNAs. In this chapter, we focus our discussion on a reliable and quantitative reporter-based siRNA validation system that has been previously established in our laboratory. The system consists of a short synthetic DNA fragment containing an RNAi-targeted sequence of interest and two expression vectors for targeting reporter and triggering siRNA expressions. The effi ciency of siRNAs is determined by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporters with easily quantifi ed readouts including enhanced green fl uorescence protein and fi refl y luciferase. Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA fragment is needed for constructing this reliable and effi cient reporter-based siRNA validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective RNAi-targeted sequences from mammalian genes but also implicates the use of RNAi-based dsRNA reagents for reverse functional genomics and molecular therapeutics.
79e85d2029542868cf5a548da396005576cf4e1b	Here, we focus on the data analysis of the growth of epidemic spread of Covid-19 in countries where different policies of containment were activated. It is known that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential, but it is not known how to quantify the success of different containment policies. We identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime following the Ostwald growth, where, over the course of time, one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact, we found values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and Italy, respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment policy.
4fd1c691c597e918519a7b7e10817715f08b4ea3	The aroma properties of fish broths prepared from 16 fish species (10 saltwater, three freshwater, two anadromous and one brackish water species) were described quantitatively by reference to 10 sensory attributes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis of sensory attributes classified the fish into four groups. Group 1, characterised by a strong 'green' odour, comprised all three freshwater species (loach, pond smelt and carp), two saltwater whitefish species (snapper and conger) and eel. Group 2 included migratory coastal species (sardine, banded blue-sprat and mackerel) and was distinguished by strong 'fish oil' and 'grilled fish' notes. Group 3 consisted of swordfish, sablefish and salmon, which exhibited a strong 'fried chicken' note. Group 4 included flounder, cod, tuna and goby, which were scored high for 'cooked fish', 'roasted soy sauce', 'canned tuna' and 'sweet' aromas. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models derived from selected influential peaks in the gas chromatograms of the volatile components in the broths for each attribute were highly predictive (R 2 5 0.936). The selected peaks corresponded well to each sensory attribute.
2ac2a211316c0bab59cfc01d01275b153b0bbe52	The enteropathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes severe disease in young piglets. We have studied the protective effects of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (E. faecium), which is approved as a feed additive in the European Union, against TGEV infection. E. faecium was added to swine testicle (ST) cells before, concomitantly with, or after TGEV infection. Viability assays revealed that E. faecium led to a dose-dependent rescue of viability of TGEV-infected cells reaching nearly to complete protection. Virus yields of the E. faecium-treated cultures were reduced by up to three log 10 units. Western blot analysis of purified TGEV revealed that the levels of all viral structural proteins were reduced after E. faecium treatment. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed attachment of TGEV particles to the surface of E. faecium which might be a means to trap virus and to prevent infection. Increased production of nitric oxide in the cells treated with E. faecium and elevated expression of interleukin 6 and 8 pointed to stimulated cellular defense as a mechanism to fight TGEV infection.
0b05d7c01a206e8d040d7cdc078707a87fdd73b0	Background: The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus has severely impacted almost all countries around the world. It not only has caused a tremendous burden on healthcare providers to bear, but it has also severely impacted the global economy and social life. The presence of reliable data and the results of in-depth statistical analyses provide researchers and policymakers with invaluable information to understand this pandemic and its growth pattern more clearly. Objective: This study aims to gather an extensive collection of fine-grained regional features along with COVID-19 pandemic patterns across the United States and to design statistical methodologies and machine learning pipelines to provide means for a more thorough understanding of the underlying patterns and enable the use of Artificial Intelligence. Methods: This paper processes and combines an extensive collection of publicly available datasets to provide a unified information source for representing areas and sub-regions with regards to their pandemic-related behavior. The features are grouped into various categories to account for their impact based on the higher-level concepts associated with them. This work uses several correlation analysis techniques to observe value and order relationships between features, feature groups, and COVID-19 occurrences. Dimensionality reduction techniques and projection methodologies are used to elaborate on individual and group contribution of these informative features to the representation variance. In addition, a specific RNN-based inference pipeline called DoubleWindowLSTM-CP is designed in this work for predictive event modeling with minimal use of historical data on outbreak events, thus utilizing sequential and temporal patterns as well as enabling concise record representation. Results: The primarily quantitative results of our statistical analytics indicated critical patterns reflecting on many of the expected collective behavior and their associated outcomes. As an example, the 33% Pearson correlation with a p-value smaller than 0.0001 indicates a well-defined relationship between the proportion of public transit in the methods of commute to work and the daily number of deaths due to COVID-19. Regarding deep learning, our DoubleWindowLSTM-CP instance with the time window of t = 10 days exhibits clear training convergence and efficient prediction results. Conclusions: Representing a region and its population and community can play an essential role in pandemic modeling, and this is due to the fact that such representation reflects on the regional reaction and susceptibility to the outbreak. The analysis presented here demonstrates that high-resolution region-based features can be leveraged to obtain accurate outbreak event predictions while using but a minimal amount of historical data on the pandemic patterns.
f0c6395636cafe64fd0ec722d3559b4a1b29d611	Recent outbreaks of Ebola, West Nile, Chikungunya, Middle Eastern Respiratory and other emerging/re-emerging RNA viruses continue to highlight the need to further understand the virushost interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome. As part of the early host antiviral defense, the innate immune system mediates pathogen recognition and initiation of potent antiviral programs that serve to limit virus replication and spread and activate adaptive immune responses. Concordantly, viral pathogens have evolved several strategies to counteract pathogen recognition and cell-intrinsic antiviral responses. In this Review, we highlight the major mechanisms of innate immune evasion by emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses, focusing on pathogens that pose significant risk to public health.
dd30d7971d2ab4ee8d5631bbfc2e3b75cc828209	Introduction: Secretory phospholipase A2 is supposed to play a role in acute lung injury but no data are available for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is not clear which enzyme subtypes are secreted and what the relationships are between enzyme activity, biophysical and biochemical parameters, and clinical outcomes. We aimed to measure the enzyme and identify its subtypes and to study its biochemical and biophysical effect. The secondary aim was to correlate enzyme activity with clinical outcome. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 24 infants with ARDS and 14 controls with no lung disease. Samples were assayed for secretory phospholipase A2 and molecules related to its activity and expression. Western blotting and captive bubble surfactometry were also performed. Clinical data were real time downloaded. Results: Tumor necrosis factor-α (814 (506-2,499) vs. 287 (111-1,315) pg/mL; P = 0.04), enzyme activity (430 (253-600) vs. 149 (61-387) IU/mL; P = 0.01), free fatty acids (4.3 (2.8-8.6) vs. 2 (0.8-4.6) mM; P = 0.026), and minimum surface tension (25.6 ± 6.1 vs. 18 ± 1.8 mN/m; P = 0.006) were higher in ARDS than in controls. Phospholipids are lower in ARDS than in controls (76.5 (54-100) vs. 1,094 (536-2,907) μg/mL; P = 0.0001). Three enzyme subtypes were identified (-IIA, -V, -X), although in lower quantities in controls; another subtype (-IB) was mainly detected in ARDS. Significant correlations exist between enzyme activity, free fatty acids (ρ = 0.823; P < 0.001), and surface tension (ρ = 0.55; P < 0.028). Correlations also exist with intensive care stay (ρ = 0.54; P = 0.001), PRISM-III 24 (ρ = 0.79; P< 0.001), duration of ventilation (ρ = 0.53; P = 0.002), and oxygen therapy (ρ = 0.54; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Secretory phospholipase A2 activity is raised in pediatric ARDS and constituted of four subtypes. Enzyme correlates with some inflammatory mediators, surface tension, and major clinical outcomes. Secretory phospholipase A2 may be a clinically relevant target in pediatric ARDS.
c754ce4a15d6efa184842b77848e34d04445e209	This paper presents many types of interplays between parasites and the host, showing the history of parasites, the effects of parasites on the outcome of wars, invasions, migrations, and on the development of numerous regions of the globe, and the impact of parasitic diseases on the society and on the course of human evolution. It also emphasizes the pressing need to change the look at the parasitism phenomenon, proposing that the term "cohabitant" is more accurate than parasite, because every living being, from bacteria to mammals, is a consortium of living beings in the pangenome. Even the term parasitology should be replaced by cohabitology because there is no parasite alone and host alone: both together compose a new adaptive system: the parasitized-host or the cohabitant-cohabited being. It also suggests switching the old paradigm based on attrition and destruction, to a new one founded on adaptation and living together.
088c5ae25413cf52d45548a7a7d79e47077416e8	COVID-19 has affected people's lives all over the world. It has created a perplexing situation about what actions one should and should not take. Mathematical modeling of biological systems is challenging and gives a different perspective, especially in decision making under multiple complex scenarios. Public health officials grapple with multiple issues such as recommending a lockdown, contact tracing, promoting the mask usage, social distancing, and frequent handwashing, as well as keeping the families of patients in isolation for the incubation period. It is even more challenging to find the optimal combination of all of the above without the use of a suitable mathematical model. There are many different approaches to modeling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some models are easy to use, while others need extensive use of highend computers. However, models to assist public health official's decision making are hard to find. In this paper, we discuss a novel systems approach to building a model for simulating the spread of COVID-19. The model, MIMANSA, divides an individual's in-person social interactions into three areas, namely home, workplace, and public places. While tracking the in-person interactions, the model follows the virus spread. Internally, the model labels healthy people who turn into silent carriers, virus-infected patients, or healthy carriers. It tracks down to the smallest level of a single day interaction. As and when a new silent carrier is created, the model automatically expands and builds a network of virus spread. All single-day blocks are integrated to get the final result. MIMANSA is novel due to its ability to build a virus spread network as a multilevel, integrated model, and in the end, enable one to make complex decisions with ease. MIMANSA is trained and validated using the data from the www.COVID-19India.org website. It does not use any arbitrary constants. All its parameters have a physical significance and are measurable. Once trained, the parameter estimation is complete, and the model is ready to run multiple scenarios. MIMANSA has four control mechanisms that a user can use. It helps one simulate the whatif scenarios. The first one is to control the exposure level to the virus depending on the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review) number of hours spent with a silent carrier. The second provides control over the infection rate or the probability of a healthy person getting infected in the presence of a silent carrier. The third one allows the user to control lockdown effectiveness percentage, and the fourth one gives control over quarantine percentage. Inside the model, MIMANSA differentiates between virus-infected patients, silent carriers, and healthy carriers. MIMANSA has the capability to consider variations in virus activity levels of every asymptomatic patient, varying the exposure to the virus, and varying the infection rate depending on the person's immunity. MIMANSA can simulate scenarios to study the impact of many different conditions simultaneously. MIMANSA assists public health officials in complex decision making, enables scientists in projecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread, and aids hospital administrators in management. MIMANSA will play a significant role in finding the balance between the effect of strict lockdown on the economy vs. the marginally high number of COVID-19 patients with a bit relaxed lockdown.
fd1a07273551e17ea2b2aa99a6867e2fc3f07aa9	Objectives: To describe the practice of physical therapy for patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy and assess data related to the safety and feasibility of physical therapy interventions. Design: A retrospective observational cohort study. Patients: Surgical and cardiovascular patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy during a 2-year period from December 2016 to November 2018. Setting: Two ICUs at a single academic medical center. Intervention: Physical mobility and ambulation while on continuous renal replacement therapy. Measurements and Main Results: Therapy data including ICU Mobility Scale score, number of physical therapy sessions with and without ambulation and gait distance, along with safety data including filter life, safety events, and mortality were analyzed. The cohort of patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy during the 2-year period was 206. Of these, 172 (83.49%) received simultaneous physical therapy. The median ICU Mobility Scale was 5 (interquartile range, 4-7) over a total of 1,517 physical therapy sessions. Ambulation with concomitant continuous renal replacement therapy connected was achieved in 78 patients (37.86%). There were 377 ambulation sessions (24.85% of all sessions) with a mean of 4.83 (sds 4.94) ambulation sessions per ambulatory patient. Patients walked an average of 888.53 feet (sd 1,365.50) while on continuous renal replacement therapy and a daily average of 150.61 feet (sd 133.50). In-hospital mortality was lowest for patients who ambulated (17.95%) and highest for patients who received no therapy (73.53%). Continuous renal replacement therapy filter life was longest for patients who ambulated (2,047.20 min [sd 1,086.50 min]), and shortest in patients who received no therapy (1,682.20 min [sd 1,343.80 min]). One safety event was reported during this time (0.0007% of all physical therapy sessions). Conclusions: Ambulation while on continuous renal replacement therapy was not associated with an increased risk of safety events and was feasible with the use of nonfemoral catheters and dialysis equipment with internal batteries.
12439ee624230668be6ed4d78fc867d960d5f107	Autophagy is an important survival pathway and participates in the host response to infection. Beneficial effects of melatonin have been previously reported in an animal model of acute liver failure (ALF) induced by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). This study was aimed to investigate whether melatonin protection against liver injury induced by the RHDV associates to modulation of autophagy. Rabbits were infected with 2 9 10 4 hemagglutination units of a RHDV isolate and received 20 mg/kg melatonin at 0, 12, and 24 hr postinfection. RHDV induced autophagy, with increased expression of beclin-1, ubiquitin-like autophagy-related (Atg)5, Atg12, Atg16L1 and sequestrosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1), protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) staining, and conversion of LC3-I to autophagosome-associated LC3-II. These effects reached a maximum at 24 hr postinfection, in parallel to extensive colocalization of LC3 and lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP)-1. The autophagic response induced by RHDV infection was significantly inhibited by melatonin administration. Melatonin treatment also resulted in decreased immunoreactivity for RHDV viral VP60 antigen and a significantly reduction in RHDV VP60 mRNA levels, oxidized to reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG/GSH), caspase-3 activity, and immunoglobulin-heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) expression. Results indicate that, in addition to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects, and the suppression of ER stress, melatonin induces a decrease in autophagy associated with RHDV infection and inhibits RHDV RNA replication. Results obtained reveal novel molecular pathways accounting for the protective effect of melatonin in this animal model of ALF.
e4c74e7b5b49aa74e2219f53fd0202f811cf85d6	Enterovirus genome replication occurs at virus-induced structures derived from cellular membranes and lipids. However, the origin of these replication organelles (ROs) remains uncertain. Ultrastructural evidence of the membrane donor is lacking, suggesting that the sites of its transition into ROs are rare or fleeting. To overcome this challenge, we combined live-cell imaging and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy of whole cells to capture emerging enterovirus ROs. The first foci of fluorescently labeled viral protein correlated with ROs connected to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preceded the appearance of ROs stemming from the trans-Golgi network. Whole-cell data sets further revealed striking contact regions between ROs and lipid droplets that may represent a route for lipid shuttling to facilitate RO proliferation and genome replication. Our data provide direct evidence that enteroviruses use ER and then Golgi membranes to initiate RO formation, demonstrating the remarkable flexibility with which enteroviruses usurp cellular organelles. IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses are causative agents of a range of human diseases. The replication of these viruses within cells relies on specialized membranous structures termed replication organelles (ROs) that form during infection but whose origin remains elusive. To capture the emergence of enterovirus ROs, we use correlative light and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, a powerful method to pinpoint rare events in their whole-cell ultrastructural context. RO biogenesis was found to occur first at ER and then at Golgi membranes. Extensive contacts were found between early ROs and lipid droplets (LDs), which likely serve to provide LD-derived lipids required for replication. Together, these data establish the dual origin of enterovirus ROs and the chronology of their biogenesis at different supporting cellular membranes. KEYWORDS replication organelle biogenesis, coxsackievirus, picornavirus, serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, SBF-SEM, correlative light and electron microscopy, CLEM, volume electron microscopy, membrane structure T he production of novel membrane structures is an intriguing and highly conserved feature of positive-sense RNA (ϩRNA) virus infections. These modified host cell membranes are increasingly referred to as viral replication organelles (ROs), distinct membrane structures that have been suggested to serve as platforms for viral RNA synthesis by coordinating different stages of the viral replicative cycle and/or shielding viral products from innate immune sensors (1-3). While the formation of ROs during infection is a hallmark of ϩRNA virus replication, the specific morphologies produced vary by virus.

bb00344e0190aecb443df52c9707795577fe6c73	The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiencies of selected anti-emetic drugs (metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant) in preventing vomiting in the treatment of canine parvoviral enteritis. We designed a randomized, prospective clinical study. PVE quick ELISA test-positive dogs between 4 and 12 months of age were included in the study. Each of metoclopramide, ondansetron, maropitant and control group had 8 dogs. Metoclopramide and ondansetron were administered as 0.5 mg/kg doses three times a day via intravenous route, and maropitant was administered as 1 mg/kg doses once a day subcutaneously. The number and severity of daily vomitings were recorded. All dogs were treated and monitored for five days; treatments were continued until all animals healed. Metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant decreased the severity of vomiting from the first day and the vomiting numbers from the third day in PVE treatment. Obtained results showed that maropitant can be used successfully such as metoclopramide and ondansetron, which are frequently used for PVE treatment. At the same time, it was discovered that metoclopramide, ondansetron and maropitant were equally effective in reducing the frequency and severity of vomiting.

2de8a8e4d7692a61cd0389c5488b8c301ccbf7a5	Part of the dorsal funiculus of the adult male rat (Wistar) spinal cord was treated for I h at the thoracolumbar level by running hot water, at approximately 48-50 ~ C, through a polyethylene tube 2 mm in diameter in contact with the dura. Animals were fixed 1 day to 4 weeks later and the spinal cords were examined by light and electron microscopy. The affected area in the dorsal funiculus was approximately i mm long and less than 1 mm wide at the dorsal surface, and varied from 0.4 to 0.7 mm in depth. Within 3 days after treatment, almost all the myelin sheaths in the affected area were degraded, leaving the axons denuded, and at the same time astrocyte endfeet at the glial limiting membrane were swollen and partly destroyed. Almost all the denuded axons remained intact, exhibiting no noticeable morphological changes. There was evidence of a moderate vasogenic oedema, but minimal signs of haemorrhage in the lesion. Seven days after treatment, many immature Schwann cells but no oligodendrocytes were found between the denuded axons. By 2 weeks many of the denuded axons were remyelinated, and by 4 weeks almost all of those axons located near the pial and per;vascular surfaces had been remyelinated by Schwann cells, while most of those located in the deep and marginal zones bordering the adjoining intact areas were remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Longitudinal sections revealed that at nodes of Ranvier PNS-type myelin sheaths were apposed by either intact or newly formed CNS-type myelin sheaths. A typical glial limiting rnembrane was not reformed beneath the pial surface, but an inconspicuous one was found between the PNS-and CNS-type fibre areas.
446d32e87a40601567c9cec58865f6984fda2c51	Using standard systems biology methodologies a 14-compartment dynamic model was developed for the Corona virus epidemic. The model predicts that: (i) it will be impossible to limit lockdown intensity such that sufficient herd immunity develops for this epidemic to die down, (ii) the death toll from the SARS-CoV-2 virus decreases very strongly with increasing intensity of the lockdown, but (iii) the duration of the epidemic increases at first with that intensity and then decreases again, such that (iv) it may be best to begin with selecting a lockdown intensity beyond the intensity that leads to the maximum duration, (v) an intermittent lockdown strategy should also work and might be more acceptable socially and economically, (vi) an initially intensive but adaptive lockdown strategy should be most efficient, both in terms of its low number of casualties and shorter duration, (vii) such an adaptive lockdown strategy offers the advantage of being robust to unexpected imports of the virus, e.g. due to international travel, (viii) the eradication strategy may still be superior as it leads to even fewer deaths and a shorter period of economic downturn, but should have the adaptive strategy as backup in case of unexpected infection imports, (ix) earlier detection of infections is the most effective way in which the epidemic can be controlled, whilst waiting for vaccines. npj Systems Biology and Applications (2020) 6:18 ; https://doi.
e5fc2d09581729eb1e86927e54c42b01045920eb	In many outbreaks caused by viruses, the transmission of the agents can occur through contaminated environmental surfaces. Because of the increasing incidence of viral infections, there is a need to evaluate novel engineering control methods for inactivation of viruses on surfaces. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is considered a promising method to inactivate viruses. This study evaluated UVGI effectiveness for viruses on the surface of gelatin-based medium in a UV exposure chamber. The effects of UV dose, viral nucleic acid type (single-stranded RNA, ssRNA; single-stranded DNA, ssDNA; double-stranded RNA, dsRNA; and double-stranded DNA, dsDNA), and relative humidity on the virus survival fraction were investigated. For 90% viral reduction, the UV dose was 1.32 to 3.20 mJ/cm 2 for ssRNA, 2.50 to to 4.47 mJ/cm 2 for ssDNA, 3.80 to 5.36 mJ/cm 2 for dsRNA, and 7.70 to 8.13 mJ/cm 2 for dsDNA. For all four tested viruses, the UV dose for 99% viral reduction was 2 times higher than those for 90% viral reduction. Viruses on a surface with single-stranded nucleic acid (ssRNA and ssDNA) were more susceptible to UV inactivation than viruses with double-stranded nucleic acid (dsRNA and dsDNA). For the same viral reduction, the UV dose at 85% relative humidity (RH) was higher than that at 55% RH. In summary, results showed that UVGI was an effective method for inactivation of viruses on surfaces.
8bc90e77e3b2260e5c7a2c6cf66a52588be798f8	The novel Covid-19 was identified in Wuhan China in December, 2019 and has created medical emergency world wise and distorted many life in the couple of month, it is being burned challenging situation for the medical scientist and virologists. Fractional order derivative based modeling is quite important to understand the real world problems and to analyse realistic situation of the proposed model. In the present investigation a fractional model based on Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative has been developed for the transmission of CORONA VIRUS in Wuhan China. The existence and uniqueness solutions of the fractional order derivative has been investigated with the help of fixed point theory. Adamas-Bashforth numerical scheme has been used in the numerical simulation of the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional order derivative. The analysis of susceptible population, exposed population, infected population, recovered population and concentration of the virus of COVID-19 in the surrounding environment with respect to time for different values of fractional order derivative has been shown by means of graph. The comparative analysis has also been performed from classical model and fractional model along with the certified experimental data.
ae05274f4d697a91934241401db6606783cc75f8	We trained and validated late fusion deep learning-machine learning models to predict nonsevere COVID-19, severe COVID-19, non-COVID viral infection, and healthy classes from clinical, lab testing, and CT scan features extracted from convolutional neural network and achieved predictive accuracy of >96% to differentiate all four classes at once based on a large dataset of 689 participants. Abstract Effectively identifying COVID-19 patients using non-PCR clinical data is critical for the optimal clinical outcomes. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of various biomedical features and appropriate technical approaches to accurately detecting COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe (NS) and 148 in severe (S) clinical type, 198 non-infected healthy (H) participants and 129 non-COVID viral pneumonia (V) patients. The participants' clinical information (23 features), lab testing results (10 features), and thoracic CT scans upon admission were acquired as three input feature modalities. To enable late fusion of multimodality data, we developed a deep learning model to extract a 10-feature high-level representation of the CT scans. Exploratory analyses showed substantial differences of all features among the four classes. Three machine learning models (k-nearest neighbor kNN, random forest RF, and support vector machine SVM) were developed based on the 43 features combined from all three modalities to differentiate four classes (NS, S, V, and H) at once. All three models had high accuracy to differentiate the overall four classes (95.4%-97.7%) and each individual class (90.6%-99.9%). Multimodal features provided substantial performance gain from using any single feature modality. Compared to existing binary classification benchmarks often focusing on single feature modality, this study provided a novel and effective breakthrough for clinical applications. Findings and the analytical workflow can be used as clinical decision support for current COVID-19 and other clinical applications with high-dimensional multimodal biomedical features.
3c48ea0a25364781ba8cd736c7fa271e00ea52f4	RNA pseudoknots play important roles in many biological processes. In the simian retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1) a pseudoknot together with a heptanucleotide slippery sequence are responsible for programmed ribosomal frameshifting, a translational recoding mechanism used to control expression of the Gag-Pol polyprotein from overlapping gag and pol open reading frames. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of the SRV-1 pseudoknot determined by NMR. The structure has a classical H-type fold and forms a triple helix by interactions between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 involving base-base and base-sugar interactions and a ribose zipper motif, not identi®ed in pseudoknots so far. Further stabilization is provided by a stack of ®ve adenine bases and a uracil in loop 2, enforcing a cytidine to bulge. The two stems of the pseudoknot stack upon each other, demonstrating that a pseudoknot without an intercalated base at the junction can induce ef®cient frameshifting. Results of mutagenesis data are explained in context with the present three-dimensional structure. The two base-pairs at the junction of stem 1 and 2 have a helical twist of approximately 49 , allowing proper alignment and close approach of the three different strands at the junction. In addition to the overwound junction the structure is somewhat kinked between stem 1 and 2, assisting the single adenosine in spanning the major groove of stem 2. Geometrical models are presented that reveal the importance of the magnitude of the helical twist at the junction in determining the overall architecture of classical pseudoknots, in particular related to the opening of the minor groove of stem 1 and the orientation of stem 2, which determines the number of loop 1 nucleotides that span its major groove.

45adcc70de274c6ec0bb467e5bd2ffdaf5fb34b3	The rapidly developing COVID-19 pandemic has raised a concern that cancer patients may have increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This discussion has mostly focused on therapy-induced immune suppression. Here, we examined the expression patterns of ACE2, the receptor through which SARX-CoV2 enters human cells, and found that ACE2 mRNA levels are elevated in tumor-adjacent normal tissues of cancer patients, including in normal-adjacent lung tissues of lung cancer patients. These observations raise the possibility that the elevated COVID-19 risk of cancer patients may not be limited to those undergoing immune-suppressing treatment. 2. Liang W, Guan W, Chen R, et al.

8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda	In recent years, many variants of percolation have been used to study network structure and the behavior of processes spreading on networks. These include bond percolation, site percolation, k-core percolation, bootstrap percolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts threshold model (WTM). We show that-except for bond percolation-each of these processes arises as a special case of the WTM, and bond percolation arises from a small modification. In fact "heterogeneous k-core percolation," a corresponding "heterogeneous bootstrap percolation" model, and the generalized epidemic process are completely equivalent to one another and the WTM. We further show that a natural generalization of the WTM in which individuals "transmit" or "send a message" to their neighbors with some probability less than 1 can be reformulated in terms of the WTM, and so this apparent generalization is in fact not more general. Finally, we show that in bond percolation, finding the set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution. A consequence of these results is that mathematical techniques developed for the WTM apply to these other models as well, and techniques that were developed for some particular case may in fact apply much more generally.
1dc18baed79c3ae009d73d109a7aaec9f9195a2f	Comprehensive protein interaction mapping projects are underway for many model species and humans. A key step in these projects is estimating the time, cost, and personnel required for obtaining an accurate and complete map. Here, we model the cost of interaction map completion across a spectrum of experimental designs. We show that current efforts may require up to 20 independent tests covering each protein pair to approach completion. We explore designs for reducing this cost substantially, including prioritization of protein pairs, probability thresholding, and interaction prediction. The best designs lower cost by four-fold overall and >100-fold in early stages of mapping. We demonstrate the best strategy in an ongoing project in Drosophila, in which we map 450 high-confidence interactions using 47 microtiter plates, versus thousands of plates expected using current designs. This study provides a framework for assessing the feasibility of interaction mapping projects and for future efforts to increase their efficiency. Analysis of molecular networks has exploded in recent years. A wide variety of technologies have been introduced for mapping networks of gene and protein interactions, including yeast two-hybrid assays1-8, affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry9-11, chromatin immunoprecipitation measurements of transcriptional binding12-14, synthetic-lethal and suppressor networks15,16, expression QTLs17-20, and many others. Using these technologies, network mapping projects are currently underway for many model species2-4,7-13,15, microbial21-23 and viral24,25 pathogens, and humans5,6. As an illustration of how pervasive networks have become, the U.S. National Institutes of Health currently funds 3076 active research grants covering the topic "protein-protein interactions" with 794 of these implementing the technique of "yeast two hybrid system"26.

1853842ed50b16e49bcebda53faac8c2ae7683f3	Coronavirus disease 2019 is inflicting a brutal blow on humankind, and no corner of the world has been exempted from its wrath. This study analyzes the chief control measures and the distinctive features of the responses implemented by Korea and the United States to contain COVID-19 with the goal of extracting lessons that can be applied globally. Even though both nations reported their index cases on the same day, Korea succeeded in flattening the curve, with 10 752 cases as of April 28, 2020, whereas the outbreak skyrocketed in the United States, which had more than 1 million cases at the same time. The prudent and timely execution of control strategies enabled Korea to tame the spread of the virus, whereas the United States paid a major price for its delay, although it is too early to render a conclusive verdict. Information pertaining to the number of people infected with the virus and measures instituted by the government to control the spread of COVID-19 was retrieved from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites and press releases. Drawing lessons from both nations, it is evident that the resolution to the COVID-19 pandemic lies in the prudent usage of available resources, proactive strategic planning, public participation, transparency in information sharing, abiding by the regulations that are put into place, and how well the plan of action is implemented.

5211a96115e408a2ac2eced159e533e8b57acaa4	This work is considered in the framework of studies dedicated to the control problems, especially in epidemiology where the scientist are concerned to develop effective control strategies to minimize the number of infected individuals. In this paper, we set this problem as an asymptotic target control problem under mixed state-control constraints, for a general class of ordinary differential equations that model the temporal evolution of disease spread. The set of initial data, from which the number of infected people decrease to zero, is generated by a new type of Lyapunov functions defined in the sense of viability theory. The associated controls are provided via selections of adequately designed feedback map. The existence of such selections is improved by using Micheal selection theorem. Finally, an application to the SIRS epidemic model, with numerical simulations, is given to show the efficiency of our approach. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that used a set-valued approach based on the viability theory to deal with an epidemic control problem.
92c8c5e5a6f6e80841bbe460bd6f3ad18a790de4	Biological molecules such as oligonucleotides, polysaccharides, and proteins that function as antigens, allergens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are of nanometre (nm) size 1,2 (TABLE 1). In this Review we discuss how the size, shape, charge, porosity and hydrophobic properties of a compound influence its effects on the immune response and how nanotechnology can be used to engineer each of these properties (FIG. 1) . We review the role of nanotechnology with respect to its applications in the development of vaccines and immunosuppressive agents, and we highlight how the manipulation and control of objects at the nanoscale level (BOX 1) can contribute to our understanding, as well as to our targeting, of the immune response. The field of nanotechnology is vast, therefore including all of the relevant studies is beyond the scope of this Review. However, we provide examples of selected studies that show the broad range of immunological applications of nanotechnology. Inactivated vaccines typically incorporate adjuvants, which are substances that enhance the quantity and the quality of the cellular and humoral immune responses generated against the antigens that are included in the vaccine. Nanoparticles provide adjuvant activity by enhancing the delivery of antigens to the immune system or by potentiating innate immune responses (FIG. 2) . We discuss some of these nanotechnologies in the section below (FIG. 3; TABLE 2 ). Some nanotechnologies that improve vaccine efficiency, such as virus-like particles (VLPs) and MF59 (Novartis), have been used for decades, whereas others are still at the early stages of development.
39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f	Bovine noroviruses are enteric pathogens detected in fecal samples of both diarrheic and non-diarrheic calves from several countries worldwide. However, epidemiological information regarding bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many important cattle producing countries from South America. In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in feces from diarrheic dairy calves from Argentina (B4836, B4848, and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) of these three samples suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2) while the third one (B4848) was more closely related to genotype 1 (GIII.1) strains. By deep sequencing, the capsid region from two of these strains could be determined. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) together with the presence of another sequence (B4881) sharing its highest genetic relatedness with genotype 1, but sufficiently distant to constitute a new genotype. This latter strain was shown in silico to be a recombinant: phylogenetic divergence was detected between its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and its capsid protein coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a potential norovirus genotype). According to this data, this strain could be the second genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 bovine norovirus recombinant described in literature worldwide. Further analysis suggested that this strain could even be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively named GIII.4. The data provides important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.

The cell surface of the budding yeast, p~ÅÅÜ~êçãóÅÉë=ÅÉêÉîáëá~É, was engineered to anchor the K-COE on the outer layer of the cell, and consequently, the altered yeast was applied as a dietary complement for animal feed, with immunogenic functions. In this study, the K-COE gene (hJ`lb) of the Korean strain of PEDV with the signal peptide of rice amylase 1A (o~ãóN^), was fused with the gene encoding the carboxyterminal half (320 amino acid residues from the C terminus) of yeast α-agglutinin, a mating associated protein that is anchored covalently to the cell wall. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (dma) promoter was selected in order to direct the expression of the fusion construct, and the resulting recombinant plasmid was then introduced into pK=ÅÉêÉîáëá~É. The surface display of K-COE was visualized via confocal microscopy using a polyclonal antibody against K-COE as the primary antibody, and FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. The display of the K-COE on the cell surface was further verified via Western blot analysis using the cell wall fraction after the administration of α-1,3-glucanase/PNGase F/β-mannosidase treatment. © KSBB

b1cc4c6d070470446f1dd22ad3eacbe55f69a0da	Italy has been the European country most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to date and has been in social lockdown for the longest period of time compared to other countries outside China. Almost overnight, Italian behavior analysts were faced with the challenge of setting up remotely whole-family systems aimed at maintaining adaptive skills and low levels of challenging behavior to be carried out solely by caregivers. Given these extraordinary circumstances, the protocols available from the applied behavioranalytic, parent training, and autism literature did not appear to fully meet the needs of parents having to be with their children under extreme levels of stress in a confined space with limited reinforcers for 24 hr a day, 7 days a week. To meet this unprecedented challenge, we developed a dynamic and holistic protocol that extended to the full day and that recognized the need for sustainable intervention delivered solely by parents, who were often looking after more than one child. These practices are presented in this article, together with a discussion of lessons we have learned thus far, which may be useful for behavior analysts working in other regions in which the effects of the pandemic are not yet fully realized. Although somewhat unorthodox, we include some parent comments at the end with the goal of sharing the parent perspective in real time as this pandemic unfolds across the world.

58432d2ad49266df441de364700684534498b777	Background: Emergence and re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in North America, Asia and Europe has caused severe economic loss to the global swine industry. However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. Methods: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015-2016 were analyzed. Results: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.
6625c01dc50702d16748bea2bc24b8587dfbfd41	At early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic which we are experiencing, the publicly reported incidence, mortality and case fatality rates (CFR) vary significantly between countries. Here we aim to untangle factors that are associated with the differences during the first quarter of the year 2020. Number of performed COVID-19 tests has a strong correlation with country-specific incidence (p < 2 × 10 -16 ) and mortality rate (p = 5.1 × 10 -8 ). Using multivariate linear regression we show that incidence and mortality rates correlate significantly with GDP per capita (p = 2.6 × 10 -15 and 7.0 × 10 -4 , respectively), country-specific duration of the outbreak (2.6 × 10 -4 and 0.0019), fraction of citizens over 65 years old (p = 0.0049 and 3.8 × 10 -4 ) and level of press freedom (p = 0.021 and 0.019) which cumulatively explain 80% of variability of incidence and more than 60% of variability of mortality of the disease during the period analyzed. Country hemisphere demonstrated significant correlation only with mortality (p = 0.17 and 0.036) whereas population density (p = 0.94 and p = 0.75) and latitude (p = 0.61 and 0.059) did not reach significance in our model. Case fatality rate is shown to rise as the outbreak progresses (p=0.028). We rank countries by COVID-19 mortality corrected for incidence and the factors that were shown to affect it, and by CFR corrected for outbreak duration, yielding very similar results. Among the countries where the outbreak started after the 15th of February and with at least 1000 registered patients during the period analyzed, the lowest corrected CFR are seen in Israel, South Africa and Chile. The ranking results should be considered with caution as they do not consider all confounding factors or data reporting biases.
119a2f1357346c9a9b83d328b28a1c61e000c2b8	Bacterial and epithelial cell samples were obtained, within 24 h of onset of pharyngeal symptoms, from the palatine tonsils of nine patients (four female and five male; age range 10 -40 years, median age 23) with acute tonsillitis, culture-positive for Streptococcus pyogenes. The specimens were examined using fluorescein isothiocyanate-(FITC) and gold-labelled antiserum to S. pyogenes and fluorescence, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. S. pyogenes could be identified both in the mucous layer covering the tonsils and attached to the surface epithelial cells. Long chains of coccus-shaped bacteria could be seen encroaching on the epithelial cell borders. S. pyogenes can apparently penetrate the mucous barrier, attach to the epithelial cells, spread from cell to cell and possibly penetrate into the outermost layer of the epithelial cells. These events in turn provoke cytokine production and/or complement activation, which induce inflammatory reaction in the tonsillar tissue.
d80948f7191d7dadfff6812dd097519cd6c577d4	The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) glycoprotein 4 (GP4) resembles a typical type I membrane protein in its structure but lacks a hydrophilic tail at the C-terminus, suggesting that GP4 may be a lipid-anchored membrane protein. Using the human decay-accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), a known glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid-anchored protein, chimeric constructs were made to substitute the GPI-anchor domain of DAF with the putative lipid-anchor domain of GP4, and their membrane association and lipase cleavage were determined in cells. The DAF-GP4 fusion protein was transported to the plasma membrane and was cleaved by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), indicating that the C-terminal domain of GP4 functions as a GPI anchor. Mutational studies for residues adjacent to the GPI modification site and characterization of respective mutant viruses generated from infectious cDNA clones show that the ability of GP4 for membrane association corresponded to virus viability and growth characteristics. The residues T158 (ω − 2, where ω is the GPI moiety at E160), P159 (ω − 1), and M162 (ω + 2) of GP4 were determined to be important for virus replication, with M162 being of particular importance for virus infectivity. The complete removal of the peptide-anchor domain in GP4 resulted in a complete loss of virus infectivity. The depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of cells reduced the virus production, suggesting a role of lipid rafts in PRRSV infection. Remarkably, GP4 was found to colocalize with CD163 in the lipid rafts on the plasma membrane. Since CD163 has been reported as a cellular receptor for PRRSV and GP4 has been shown to interact with this receptor, our data implicates an important role of lipid rafts during entry of the virus.

38321345afd0ea4ce0f50902b1944751e5ad243b	The expanded use of information technology in education has led to the emergence of technostress due to a lack of adaptation to the technological environment. The purpose of this study is to identify the levels of technostress in primary and secondary education in 428 teachers using a RED-TIC questionnaire, of which skepticism, fatigue, anxiety, and inefficiency are the main components. For the empirical analysis of the data, principal component analysis (PCA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used. The results show that 12% of Chilean teachers participating in the study feel techno-fatigued, 13% feel techno-anxious, and 11% present both conditions. Male teachers show a higher incidence of techno-anxiety and techno-fatigue than their female peers. It can be concluded that the questionnaire used is a reliable tool to evaluate the presence of technostress, and it manifests itself importantly in its components of techno-anxiety and techno-fatigue in Chilean teachers.
03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299	The causes of infections in pediatric populations differ between age groups and settings, particularly in the tropics. Such differences in epidemiology may lead to misdiagnosis and ineffective empirical treatment. Here, we investigated the current spectrum of pathogens causing febrile diseases leading to pediatric hospitalization in Lambaréné, Gabon. From August 2015 to March 2016, we conducted a prospective, cross-sectional, hospital-based study in a provincial hospital. Patients were children ≤ 15 years with fever ≥ 38 °C and required hospitalization. A total of 600 febrile patients were enrolled. Malaria was the main diagnosis found in 52% (311/600) patients. Blood cultures revealed septicemia in 3% (17/593), among them four cases of typhoid fever. The other causes of fever were heterogeneously distributed between both bacteria and viruses. Severe infections identified by Lambaréné Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) were also most often caused by malaria, but children with danger signs did not have more coinfections than others. In 6% (35/600) of patients, no pathogen was isolated. In Gabon, malaria is still the major cause of fever in children, followed by a bacterial and viral disease. Guidelines for both diagnosis and management should be tailored to the spectrum of pathogens and resources available locally. Causes of fever in African pediatric populations are more diverse than previously thought. A landmark study conducted in Tanzania showed that due to a change in epidemiology, a broad spectrum of pathogens replaced P. falciparum malaria as the most common cause of disease in children in this area 1 . However, a few years later, P. falciparum malaria, is still seen to be the main cause of febrile illnesses in Ghana, West Africa 2 . When unaware, these differences in epidemiology might lead to misdiagnosis as well as inefficient treatment by the medical personnel. The process of medical diagnosis includes the joint interpretation of symptoms, clinical signs and laboratory findings. Careful selection and prioritization of a diagnostic setup are informed by a priori knowledge of the seasonal, local and worldwide frequency and distribution of a given disease 3,4 . Our study describes the distribution of infections, co-infections, and co-morbidities in children hospitalized for febrile illnesses at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital (HAS) in Lambaréné, Gabon, as an example for a hospital in a semiurban Central African region. In addition, we present the current spectrum of pathogens causing severe disease identified by Lambaréné Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) in these children. Study patients. A total of 600 febrile patients ≤ 15 years were enrolled in our study. Of these, 280 (47%) were females; 69% (415/600) patients were < 5 years, and median (IQR) age was 29 [12-68] months (Table 1) . Seven percent (40/549, NA = 51) had at least one known chronic medical condition prior to admission, among the main ones: 4% (23/600) patients had homozygous sickle cell disease; 1% (6/600) were HIV positive. Vaccination coverage of the expanded program on immunization (EPI) vaccines was above 80% for scheduled doses of BCG, poliomyelitis and pentavalent (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccines, and 54% and 55% for measles and yellow fever vaccines, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). General condition. On admission, 4% (23/593, NA = 7) patients were prostrated. Malnutrition -defined by a weight-for-age Z-score < −2SD was found in 22% (132/600) patients. Table 2a depicts differences of clinical parameters that werefound statistically significant, in relation to major clinical signs. Anemia was more pronounced in severely malnourished patients -having a weight-for-age Z-Score < −3SD, with a hemoglobin concentration of 8.3 g/dL versus 9.2 g/dL (p = 0.02) (Table 2b) . Laboratory values and imaging. Laboratory values were mostly as expected for the respective clinical condition. Table 2b depicts differences of hematological parameters and liver function tests in relation to major clinical signs. Chest radiography was done in children with respiratory signs and/or leucocytes ≥20,000/mm 3 as early as possible after admission (Fig. 1) . Parasitology. Overall, 52% (311/600) patients were diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum (P.f.) malaria, ten of them as mixed infections: seven P. malariae (P.m), three P. ovale curtisi (P.o.c.), and one P. ovale wallikeri (P.o.w.). One patient was infected with P.f., P.m., and P.o.c. at the same time. PCR-screening for Babesia spp. was negative in all patients. Urine analysis revealed one Schistosoma haematobium infection.

b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31	This study was performed to investigate the mechanism of action of ursolic acid in terms of anti-Toxoplasma gondii effects, including immunomodulatory effects. We evaluated the anti-T. gondii effects of ursolic acid, and analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokines through co-cultured immune cells, as well as the expression of intracellular organelles of T. gondii. The subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii, particularly rhoptry protein 18, microneme protein 8, and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3, were markedly decreased when T. gondii was treated with ursolic acid, and their expressions were effectively inhibited. Furthermore, ursolic acid effectively increased the production of NO, ROS, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-β, while reducing the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in T. gondii-infected immune cells. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid not only causes anti-T. gondii activity/action by effectively inhibiting the survival of T. gondii and the subcellular organelles of T. gondii, but also induces specific immunomodulatory effects in T. gondii-infected immune cells. Therefore, this study indicates that ursolic acid can be effectively utilized as a potential candidate agent for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs, and has immunomodulatory activity. different sub-proteins such as IMC sub-compartment proteins 1, 2, and 3 [2] [3] [4] . The protein kinases of T. gondii have been known to play key roles for modulating the motility, invasion, replication, egress, and survival within the host [5] . It was reported that T. gondii is divided through a unique form of cell division such as endodyogeny, and its chromosomal passenger complex is essential for the organization of a functional mitotic spindle [6] . Furthermore, T. gondii not only forms a parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) after invasion into host cells, but also proliferates and grows into a PVM [7-9]. For decades, several compounds through many researchers and groups were developed as drugs for treating toxoplasmosis, and are usefully used in clinics. However, existing drugs are widely vulnerable to drug-resistance in clinics globally. To overcome pharmacological barriers to these challenges, the efforts for treating infectious diseases have been attempted in various fields, and it has been reported that various extracts/compounds derived from medicinal plants and new synthetic compounds have anti-T. gondii effects in the in vitro and pre-clinic stages [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Until recently, various compounds derived from plants have showed a leading role and ability as a source of specialized metabolites with medical effects as well as pharmacological activities. In addition, it was reported that various extracts/compounds derived from plants and synthetic compounds could be used in the medical field as useful resources for treating acute or chronic infectious diseases caused by schistosomiasis, leishmania, malaria, or tuberculosis, as well as viral diseases including middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) or Zika fever and avian influenza [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, effective next-generation drugs for treating toxoplasmosis have not yet been developed, and the difficulty of drug development against zoonosis is still causing a public health crisis globally. In this context, various studies on the development or discovery of effective drugs and novel candidates against parasitic zoonosis are urgently required. In this regard, ursolic acid is a bioactive compound derived from medicinal plants, and is also known to have selective bioactive properties such as anti-inflammatory [24-27] and anticancer effects [28] [29] [30] [31] . It also effectively induces various activities, including antimicrobial [32-34] and anti-parasitic effects [35, 36] . Until recently, although studies and compounds regarding anti-T. gondii activity have been reported globally [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , the mechanism of action of ursolic acid on the inhibitory effect of T. gondii and the immunomodulatory activity was not reported yet. From this perspective, this study was performed to evaluate the mechanism of action and the immunomodulatory activity of ursolic acid in terms of anti-T. gondii effects and activity, and to confirm the potential as a potent candidate drug for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis agents. Results T. gondii has a specific network structure and systems, including various intracellular organelles such as the mitochondrion, apicoplast, dense granule, and rhoptry (Figure 1) , which induces serious zoonotic diseases such as toxoplasmosis, particularly in humans, while causing infection in various vertebrates. Before evaluating the mechanism of action of ursolic acid against T. gondii, we measured the inhibitory effect of ursolic acid (UA) against the survival of T. gondii and normal lung cells infected with T. gondii through an MTT assay as described previously [9] , which showed significant results and reproducibility. When T. gondii was treated with UA (12.5-400 µg/mL) for 24 h, the viability was effectively inhibited, and the parasitic survival rate was measured as less than 30% at 200 µg/mL. UA strongly decreased the viability of T. gondii compared with sulfadiazine (SF), which demonstrates that UA caused anti-T. gondii effect or activity against T. gondi (data not shown). In particular, the lung cells infected with T. gondii were markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with ursolic acid (12.5-200 µg/mL) when compared with the untreated infection cells and the T. gondii-infected cells treated with SF ( Figure 2) . Furthermore, it was clearly shown that there were significant differences between the untreated T. gondii-group and the experimental groups. In these aspects, it was demonstrated that UA effectively induced the selective anti-parasitic effect/action compared to the SF-treated group and the untreated group through a direct inhibitory effect on the Pathogens 2019, 8, 61 3 of 18 viability of T. gondii. This shows that UA has the potential to be utilized as an anti-T. gondii candidate agent and/or a synergic compound with the existing drugs for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis agents. Therefore, these results indicate that UA strongly inhibits or blocks the survival of T. gondii by effectively inducing anti-T. gondii activity through the selective inhibitory activity and/or action against the viability of T. gondii.

8dcf9ad69a3186fd2acc9d68d911857574ed055a	The management of patients with highly infectious diseases (HIDs) is a challenge for healthcare provision requiring a high level of care without compromising the safety of other patients and healthcare workers. Aim: To study the infection control practice in isolation facilities participating in the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases (EuroNHID) project. Methods: A survey was conducted during 2009 of 48 isolation facilities caring for patients with HIDs in 16 European countries. Checklists and standard evaluation forms were used to collect and interpret data on hand hygiene, routine hygiene and disinfection, and waste management. Findings: Forty percent of HIDs had no non-hand-operated sinks or alcohol-based antiseptic distributors, while 27% did not have procedures for routine hygiene, final disinfection, or safe discarding of non-disposable objects or equipment. There was considerable variation in the management of waste and in the training of housekeeping personnel. EuroNHID has developed recommendations for hand hygiene, disinfection, routine hygiene, and waste management. Conclusions: Most aspects of hand hygiene, routine hygiene and disinfection, and waste management were considered at least partially adequate in the majority of European isolation facilities dedicated for the care of patients with HIDs. But considerable variability was observed, with management of waste and training of housekeeping personnel being generally less satisfactory.
5370a4ae6200b9ee76fb8dbede9c46e4053025f4	The situation of the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that we permanently need high-value flexible solutions to urgent clinical needs including simplified diagnostic technologies suitable for use in the field and for delivering targeted therapeutics. From our perspective nanotechnology is revealed as a vital resource for this, as a generic platform of technical solutions to tackle complex medical challenges. It is towards this perspective and focusing on nanomedicine that we take issue with Prof Park's recent editorial published in the Journal of Controlled Release. Prof. Park argued that in the last 15 years nanomedicine failed to deliver the promised innovative clinical solutions to the patients (Park, K. The beginning of the end of the nanomedicine hype. Journal of Controlled Release, 2019; 305, 221-222 [1]. We, the ETPN (European Technology Platform on Nanomedicine) [2], respectfully disagree. In fact, the more than 50 formulations currently in the market, and the recent approval of 3 key nanomedicine products (e. g. Onpattro, Hensify and Vyxeos), have demonstrated that the nanomedicine field is concretely able to design products that overcome critical barriers in conventional medicine in a unique manner, but also to deliver within the cells new drug-free therapeutic effects by using pure physical modes of action, and therefore make a difference in patients lives. Furthermore, the > 400 nanomedicine formulations currently in clinical trials are expecting to bring novel clinical solutions (e.g. platforms for nucleic acid delivery), alone or in combination with other key enabling technologies to the market, including biotechnologies, microfluidics, advanced materials, biomaterials, smart systems, photonics, robotics, textiles, Big Data and ICT (information & communication technologies) more generally. However, we agree with Prof. Park that " it is time to examine the sources of difficulty in clinical translation of nanomedicine and move forward ". But for reaching this goal, the investments to support clinical translation of promising nanomedicine formulations should increase, not decrease. As recently encouraged by EMA in its roadmap to 2025, we should create more unity through a common knowledge hub linking academia, industry, healthcare providers and hopefully policy makers to reduce the current fragmentation of the standardization and regulatory body landscape. We should also promote a strategy of cross-technology innovation, support nanomedicine development as a high value and low-cost solution to answer unmet medical needs and help the most promising innovative projects of the field to get better and faster to the clinic. This global vision is the one that the ETPN chose to encourage for the last fifteen years. All actions should be taken with a clear clinical view in mind, " without any fanfare", to focus "on what matters in real life", which is the patient and his/her quality of life. This ETPN overview of achievements in nanomedicine serves to reinforce our drive towards further expanding and growing the maturity of nanomedicine for global healthcare, accelerating the pace of transformation of its great potential into tangible medical breakthroughs.
48950452e67f99e2abd1226e7fc2431bdd1d9934	Since then, a large part of the world has been shut down, and most regions are now starting to slowly return to a new normal. The effect of both the virus and the responses to the virus have dramatically affected lives and livelihoods. The effect on scholarly publishing and research has been dramatic, although it is likely that we will feel further effects in the next year or two as the fallout of the economic hiatus emerges. In the meantime, looking back at how the industry has responded during the past few months can help to plan for the future. As we emerge from lockdown, it will be increasingly important to evaluate our role within research communication, the value we add, and our resilience in the face of massive disruption.

9aa38acaf58c4f7bdc2b8fce4a75f660abf314a2	New strategies to prevent and treat influenza virus infections are urgently needed. A recently discovered class of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) neutralizing an unprecedented spectrum of influenza virus subtypes may have the potential for future use in humans. Here, we assess the efficacies of CR6261, which is representative of this novel class of mAbs, and oseltamivir in mice. We show that a single injection with 15 mg/kg CR6261 outperforms a 5-day course of treatment with oseltamivir (10 mg/kg/day) with respect to both prophylaxis and treatment of lethal H5N1 and H1N1 infections. These results justify further preclinical evaluation of broadly neutralizing mAbs against influenza virus for the prevention and treatment of influenza virus infections.
5601127bf9f37f0bbee6ee392496cbc96cc88273	Subgroup analysis of treatment effects plays an important role in applications from medicine to public policy to recommender systems. It allows physicians (for example) to identify groups of patients for whom a given drug or treatment is likely to be effective and groups of patients for which it is not. Most of the current methods of subgroup analysis begin with a particular algorithm for estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) and identify subgroups by maximizing the difference across subgroups of the average treatment effect in each subgroup. These approaches have several weaknesses: they rely on a particular algorithm for estimating ITE, they ignore (in)homogeneity within identified subgroups, and they do not produce good confidence estimates. This paper develops a new method for subgroup analysis, R2P, that addresses all these weaknesses. R2P uses an arbitrary, exogenously prescribed algorithm for estimating ITE and quantifies the uncertainty of the ITE estimation, using a construction that is more robust than other methods. Experiments using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets (based on real data) demonstrate that R2P constructs partitions that are simultaneously more homogeneous within groups and more heterogeneous across groups than the partitions produced by other methods. Moreover, because R2P can employ any ITE estimator, it also produces much narrower confidence intervals with a prescribed coverage guarantee than other methods. Preprint. Under review.
7d5515797a6557b8fbecc6e6f3f46c32c2bfce93	Letters to the Editor demonstrate typical lung imaging features, including pleural line irregularities, B lines, and multifocal consolidations. 5 Early use of lung US could be valuable in COVID-19 patients, leading to early correct diagnoses and appropriate management. One particularly promising setting for this could be triage: in Italy, tents have been mounted outside the hospital as "field hospitals" to avoid contact between infected patients and noninfected ones. Providing every tent with an US scanner could permit early diagnosis outside the hospital, effectively implementing a "US triage." A US-guided triage algorithm should be developed: one such proposal is shown in the Figure. Limitations for the implementation of US triage are the lack of specific protocols and operator experience, which influences the validity of test results. Although the US triage has not yet been validated by prospective studies, it is a concept that needs prompt definition and investigation to improve our ability to decide which patients need hospitalization immediately when resources are limited and need to be conserved.
415da12bcec2afda93973648a48819c7b8da8741	The COVID-19 pandemic has led to historic economic fallout. To protect public health and stabilize incomes, governments have implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages. These fiscal supports are crucial, though there is concern that sustainable and resilient development will be sacrificed in the rush to preserve incomes and industries. The aim of the paper is to review whether the Japanese governments' responses in terms of financial stimulus considers longer term resilience and sustainability. This paper reviews pertinent academic literature and publicly available data from governments and organisations. The research is a rapid analysis of emerging information provided by the government of Japan and other international organisations. Using the case of Japan, this paper suggests that it is possible both to protect public health and essential services, while also promoting resilience and sustainability. Japan's integrated solutions show that pandemic response can include accelerated decarbonization and resilient, sustainable development. The paper also warns also that failure to act on long-term sustainability risks increased inequality, higher opportunity costs, cascading hazards, and further retreat from planetary thinking and globalism.
6140703a4f59d2feadfcc54c1185770cbaa651dc	As SARS-COV-2 and the disease COVID-19 is sweeping through countries after countries around the globe, it is critical to understand potential burden of a future outbreak in cities of Colombia. This pandemic has affected most of the countries in the world because the high global movement of individuals and excessive cost in interventions. Objective: Using demographic data from city of Cali, disease epidemiological information from affected countries and mathematical models, we estimated the rate of initial exponential growth of new cases and the basic reproductive rate for a potential outbreak in city of Cali in Colombia. Materials and methods: We used dynamical models with different modeling assumptions such as use of various types of interventions and/or epidemiological characteristics to compare and contrast the differences between Colombian cities and between Latin American countries. Results: Under the assumption of homogeneously mixing population and limited resources, we predicted expected number of infected, hospitalized, in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and deaths during this potential COVID-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that on a given day in Cali there may be up to around 73000 cases who might need hospitalization under no intervention. However, this number drastically reduces if we carry out only-isolation intervention (with 16 days of symptomatic infection; ~13,000 cases) versus both quarantining for 6 days and isolation within 16 days (~3500 cases). The peak in Cali will reach in 2-3 months. Conclusions. The estimates from these studies provides different scenarios of outbreaks and can help Cali to be better prepared during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
46b59fe2857fd4f85d709753317dce3a2e412fb0	• The impact of lock-down on total infection and death rates were significant with 62% reduction in infection rate in the overall cohort (43% total infection rates in India) over a period of 4 weeks. • A hierarchical cluster analysis revealed, that countries with early implementation of the lock-down fared better than those with late implementation. • The impressive results from Sweden and South Korea (countries without a lock-down), need a closer look in order to ascertain the reasons behind this finding. Introduction and Aims: Retarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection by preventive strategies is the first line of management. Several countries have declared a stringent lockdown in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lockdown on infection and death rates over a period of time in countries with declared lock-down. A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lockdown. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lockdown in a second-phase cluster analysis. There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lockdown in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths(Spain, Germany, Italy, UK, and France-cluster 1) fared poorly compared to those who declared lockdown early on (and Malaysia-cluster 2). Sweden and South Korea, countries without lock-down, fared as good as the countries in cluster 2. Conclusion: Lockdown has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression(infection rate and death) exponentially. The success story of non-lock-down countries (Sweden and South Korea) need to be explored in detail, to identify the variables responsible for the positive results.
7aea98cf7d30beea6043c5e62be3dafce08bdc0e	Schistosomiasis is a major human parasitic disease with a global impact. Schistosoma japonicum, the most difficult to control, can survive within host veins for decades. Mechanisms of immune evasion by the parasite, including antigenic variation and surface masking, have been implicated but not well defined. In this study, we defined the immunoglobulin-binding proteomes of S. japonicum using human IgG, IgM, and IgE as the molecular bait for affinity purification, followed by protein identification by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Several proteins situated at the tegument of S. japonicum were able to nonselectively bind to the Fc domain of host immunoglobulins, indicating a mechanism for the avoidance of host immune attachment and recognition. The profile of the immunoglobulin-binding proteomes provides further clues for immune evasion mechanisms adopted by S. japonicum. paramyosin (SCIP-1) associated with the schistosomula of the parasite membrane of both S. mansoni and S. japonicum has been proposed both as a Fc receptor of a nonspecific host IgG and as an inhibitor of complement C9 polymerization 6,11-14 . Sjc23, a member of the tetraspanin (TSP) family of S. japonicum, mediated the acquisition of human IgG via the interaction of a nine amino acid motif with the Fc domain of the IgG molecule 15 ; the specific antibodies after immunization with Sjc23 were predominantly the IgG2a type, which has been shown to be inefficient in complement fixation and to exhibit fewer cytophilic properties in ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) 16 . In this study, to investigate the host-schistosome interaction and the mechanism of immune evasion employed by S. japonicum, we applied immobilized versions of the non-immune human immunoglobulins G, M and E as molecular baits to selectively precipitate parasite interactive components that were subsequently identified by LC-MS/MS. The immunoglobulin binding proteomes of adult S. japonicum were obtained and analyzed carefully. Our results will facilitate the rational design of vaccines based on schistosomal tegument-associated antigens. Host immunoglobulins are abundantly observed on the surface of S. japonicum. To detect the binding of non-immune IgG and IgM on the surface of adult S. japonicum, IgG-and IgM-specific antibodies conjugated with a red fluorophore were separately incubated with either parasites directly flushed from the veins of infected mice or parasite sections. Mouse IgG was detected on the surface of both male and female intact adult worms using a laser confocal microscopy (Fig. 1a) . The fluorescence visualized using fluorescence microscopy was more intense on the surface of male worms compared with that of females (Fig. 1b) . Indeed, imaging of frozen sections using the laser confocal microscopy showed that the fluorescence signals were located on the outermost layer of the blood fluke (Fig. 1c) . Additionally, mouse IgM was also observed on the parasite surface (Fig. 2a) , and the adsorption of human IgG, IgM and IgE on the parasite surface was clearly observed (Fig. 2b-d) . No cross reactivity was observed with the secondary fluorescence-labeled antibodies (data not shown).
2ab24bbc71562ee67437db9fee7f83edb40f4de9	A Japanese man suffered from acute respiratory tract infection after returning to Japan from Bali, Indonesia in 2007. Miyazaki-Bali/2007, a strain of the species of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus, was isolated from the patient's throat swab using Vero cells, in which syncytium formation was observed. This is the sixth report describing a patient with respiratory tract infection caused by an orthoreovirus classified to the species of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus. Given the possibility that all of the patients were infected in Malaysia and Indonesia, prospective surveillance on orthoreovirus infections should be carried out in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, contact surveillance study suggests that the risk of human-to-human infection of the species of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus would seem to be low.

DA virus mutant DApB encodes VP2 puff B of GDVII, whereas DApBL2M contains VP1 loop II of GDVII with a point mutation in VP2 puff B. Neuraminidase treatment of cells inhibited infection by DA and DApB, but not GDVII or DApBL2M viruses; sialic acid (SA) binding correlated with virus persistence. In virus binding assays to intestine sections, all four TMEVs bound goblet cells and the mucus of the epithelium that was SA dependent. Therefore, differences in SA composition on different cell types can affect tropism and infection. Journal of NeuroVirology (2009) 15, 81Á89.

The pharmacologic action of glycyrrhizin has been shown to produce anti-inflammatory activity, modulation of the immune system, inhibition of virus growth, and inactivation of viruses. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability, efficacy, and cost of glycyrrhizin in improving the severity and duration of signs and symptoms of URTIs. The primary end point was tolerability, and the secondary end points included improvement in signs and symptoms of URTI and cost.
53ec8b143bbd6b628ad77e9e009e38ad6aef4682	The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers and increase the current knowledge on the perinatal consequences of COVID-19. Nineteen neonates were admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 31 to February 29, 2020. Their mothers were clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19. We prospectively collected and analyzed data of mothers and infants. There are 19 neonates included in the research. Among them, 10 mothers were confirmed COVID-19 by positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, and 9 mothers were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. Delivery occurred in an isolation room and neonates were immediately separated from the mothers and isolated for at least 14 days. No fetal distress was found. Gestational age of the neonates was 38.6 AE 1.5 weeks, and average birth weight was 3293 AE 425 g. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in throat swab, urine, and feces of all neonates were negative. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in breast milk and amniotic fluid was negative too. None of the neonates developed clinical, radiologic, hematologic, or biochemical evidence of COVID-19. No vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and no perinatal complications in the third trimester were found in our study. The delivery should occur in isolation and neonates should be separated from the infected mothers and care givers.
9f041e8ce395b6a4811a091568884e218e75f3f8	We describe successful usage of low dose Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (30-50 mg) in three COVID19 critically ill patients, who were in worsening respiratory failure in-spite of being on therapeutic anticoagulation. All patients had respiratory rate > 40; FiO 2 > 0.7(on NIV); PiO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 100 and D-dimer>1000 ng/ml. C.T. Pulmonary Angiography could not be done in these patients due to poor general condition, but 2D echo was normal and none of the patients was in shock. So there was no conventional indication of thrombolysis in these patients, yet after thrombolysis, we saw dramatic changes in oxygenation. All patients became off oxygen within 3-7 days and were discharged within 2 weeks. The whole idea was to prevent intubation, since mortality rates are very high in intubated COVID19 patients. tPA is associated with <1% risk of fatal bleed. In this unprecedented pandemic with high mortality rates, thrombolysis could be an effective and safe option in carefully selected critically ill patients of COVID19.
157172dccd665a52c2a44280b9a7cd21c907bc9e	The COVID-19 pandemic has hit at a time when microfinance is at its historical peak, with an estimated 139 million microfinance customers globally. Cambodia's microfinance sector is one of the fastest growing, and like others in the Global South has moved from offering entrepreneurial capital to everyday liquidity, and even disaster relief. In this Viewpoint, however, we argue that the promotion of microfinance as market-based relief and recovery from the pandemic should be a source of concern, not comfort. We firstly suggest that as a result of the health and economic impacts associated with COVID-19, credittaking is likely to escalate further in terms of the number of borrowers and loan amounts. Second, we contend that a growing reliance on MFIs will leave households undernourished, and further vulnerable to its disciplining and extractive impulses. Third, we argue that the interplay between overindebtedness, pre-existing malnutrition challenges, and the global public health crisis of COVID-19 represents a major challenge to gender equality and sustainable development. Coordination between the Cambodian government, microfinance lenders, international investors, and development partners is vital to offer debt relief. Furthermore, to reverse the reliance of so many households on the microfinance industry for survival, inclusive socio-economic policies and public welfare services must be prioritised.
68796f21a652be08fda86711e4168aea86fe7af4	The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic challenged program leaders to respond rapidly to changes in healthcare delivery, protect trainee safety, and transform educational activities. The pandemic demanded that program directors prioritize and address myriad threats to trainees' wellbeing. In this paper, we adapt Maslow's needs framework to systematically address trainee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential interventions to meet trainee needs at the program, institution, and extra-institutional levels. Transforming education to effectively respond to trainee well-being needs requires leadership, and we use Kotter's 8 step change management model as an example of a framework to effectively lead change. Program leaders can take this opportunity to reflect upon their training programs and take the opportunity to improve them. Some of the systems of education we develop during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as telehealth, tele-education, and ways to stay connected may provide advantages and will be important to continue and expand upon post-COVID-19.
b34652cd7c52b16dc961e00da7f2b64599aba91a	The Dengue virus (DENV) NS2A protein, essential for viral replication, is a poorly characterized membrane protein. NS2A displays both protein/protein and membrane/protein interactions, yet neither its functions in the viral cycle nor its active regions are known with certainty. To highlight the different membrane-active regions of NS2A, we characterized the effects of peptides derived from a peptide library encompassing this protein's full length on different membranes by measuring their membrane leakage induction and modulation of lipid phase behavior. Following this initial screening, one region, peptide dens25, had interesting effects on membranes; therefore, we sought to thoroughly characterize this region's interaction with membranes. This peptide presents an interfacial/hydrophobic pattern characteristic of a membrane-proximal segment. We show that dens25 strongly interacts with membranes that contain a large proportion of lipid molecules with a formal negative charge, and that this effect has a major electrostatic contribution. Considering its membrane modulating capabilities, this region might be involved in membrane rearrangements and thus be important for the viral cycle. a The sequence of peptide dens25, KHAILLVAVSFVTLITGNMS-FRDLGR, is underlined. See text for details.
70deaa47afb6a51ea80603bed4eb77f76d37301f	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused extensive economic losses to pig producers in many countries. It was recently introduced, for the first time, into North America and outbreaks have occurred again in multiple countries within Europe as well. To assess the properties of various diagnostic assays for the detection of PEDV infection, multiple panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of antibodies against PEDV in an inter-laboratory ring trial. Different laboratories have used a variety of "in house" ELISAs and also one commercial assay. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been estimated using a Bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard. Although different characteristics were found, it can be concluded that each of the assays used can detect infection of pigs at a herd level by either the early European strains of PEDV or the recently circulating strains (INDEL and non-INDEL). However, not all the assays seem suitable for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country. The results from individual animals, especially when the infection has occurred within an experimental situation, show more variation.
4312a29b988db89b981987fe88382b2ff22b4596	Background: Calls are increasing for widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection testing of people from populations with a very low prevalence of infection. We quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations, and on individuals, in low prevalence settings, focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing. We developed a simple, interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity, specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000. We derived numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, positive predictive value (PPV -the percentage of test positives that are true positives) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies: (1) single test for all; (2) add repeat testing in test positives; (3) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results. We also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one, two or three tests under these three strategies. With sensitivity of 80%, infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000, and specificity 99.9% on all tests, PPV in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29% with one test, increasing to >99.5% (100% when rounded to the nearest %) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3. More realistically, if specificity is 95% for the first and 99.9% for subsequent tests, single test PPV will be only 1%, increasing to 86% with repeat testing in strategy 2, or 79% with strategy 3 (albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2). In the whole population, or in particular individuals, PPV increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity. To avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations, and in particular individuals, from widespread population testing for SARS-CoV-2, the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions.
a12b1713e32ecdb8663370669817d6bdfadbe804	The characteristics of digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation and how they are related, is complex and important to understand in this digital age. Such an understanding of digital entrepreneurship is perceived as a key pillar for economic growth, job creation and innovation. However, a number of issues regarding digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation are prevalent, inhibiting digital entrepreneurs to optimise the advantages that digital entrepreneurship contributes towards business value. Therefore, the aim of this research paper is to investigate digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation, their characteristics and inter-relationships. Data extracted and analysed through a structured analysis process, recognises and discusses the characteristics of digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation. The characteristics are reported by employing the Dynamic Capabilities Theory as the structure. By understanding the characteristics of digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation, individuals and organisations may either create new business ventures or transform existing businesses through the development of novel digital technologies or the innovative application of such technologies.
80fb940d534395c1cb9f3814740b6ee5f3bb7200	Sequence comparison has become one of the essential bioinformatics tools in bioinformatics research, which could serve as evidence of structural and functional conservation, as well as of evolutionary relations among the sequences. Existing graphical representation methods have achieved promising results in sequence comparison, but there are some design challenges with the graphical representations and feature-based measures. We reported here a new method for sequence comparison. It considers whole distribution of dual bases and employs polar coordinates method to map a biological sequence into a closed curve. The curve tree was then constructed to numerically characterize the closed curve of biological sequences, and further compared biological sequences by evaluating the distance of the curve tree of the query sequence matching against a corresponding curve tree of the template sequence. The proposed method was tested by phylogenetic analysis, and its performance was further compared with alignment-based methods. The results demonstrate that using polar coordinates representation and curve tree to compare sequences is more efficient. Crown

478803202ddd4808c2d205fb8d8bc7c8ed2d566c	COVID-19 has changed life beyond recognition for millions of individuals, as countries implement social distancing measures to prevent disease transmission. For certain patient groups, such as community-dwelling older people with dementia (PwD), these restrictions may have far-reaching consequences. Medicines management may be adversely affected and deserves careful thought. PwD face unique challenges with medicines management compared to other older people, often relying upon support from family/carers and primary healthcare professionals. This article considers potential issues that PwD may face with each component of medicines management (prescribing, dispensing, administration, adherence, review), and based on previous research, highlights strategies to support PwD and their carers during this time. Primary healthcare professionals must be attentive to medicines-related needs of community-dwelling PwD, particularly those living alone, both during the pandemic and as restrictions are lifted. Carers of PwD continue to have a critical role to play in medicines management, and also require support.
b5cfe3de1f4ac33622f37867cfacef09a5ca8c94	During the COVID-19 pandemic, Spain declared a 'state of alarm' on 14 March 2020. In our Radiation Oncology Department, experienced in administering hypofractionated treatments (partial irradiation in breast cancer, moderate hypofractionation in localized prostate cancer, etc), we have increased the hypofractionated treatment indications. We are only deferring the start of non-urgent treatments such as prostate tumours under androgen deprivation or benign brain tumours which are candidates for radiosurgery such as meningiomas or acoustic neuroma. In this hypofractionation era we find that we have decreased the number of sessions per patient and that we can evaluate the last years with the fractionation index (FI) (calculated by dividing the total number of fractions administered in the department by the total number of patients treated). We have gone from 14.4 in 2018 to 13.78 in 2019, excluding brachytherapy. We report the results of the first 100 patients who have experienced radiotherapy treatment since the state of alarm (66 women and 34 men). In these patients, the FI is 12.12lower than previous years.

48d14843a50d7d6c6f64c7b4aa506c5d85bce3e2	Celebrity, Pandemic, and Domesticity I N PRESUMED INTIMACY, SOCIOLOGIST CHRIS ROJEK WRITES THAT media audiences may have "para-social" relationships with two media apparitions: statistical people and celebrities. By "parasocial" he means emotional connections to remote persons far beyond our kith and kin (1-10). A big disaster intensifies such connections with statistical victims and with celebrities as audiences look for meaning, direction, and emotional outlet. As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infects every population, statistical people-once media's remote victims of disaster-are now us, comprising nearly eight billion and summarized in escalating numbers of the infected, the surviving, and the dead. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, celebrities on social media have status as arbiters of this crisis, but an intensified domesticity has transformed their roles. Glimpses into celebrities' private lives, including their habitations, are essential to feelings of intimacy and kinship with them. The crafting of these seemingly private realms-including access to them-is part and parcel of celebrity marketing. In a disaster where massive numbers of people, worldwide, are forced to stay indoors, this display of domesticity is riveting. As people meet online, newly revealing their own domestic spaces for work and play, celebrities' domestic spaces are screen openings among many such openings. As celebrities are seen going about their daily lives, they perform among many ordinary performances and in relation to them. The contrast of their strange lives to the ordinary could never be more pronounced. One of the more interesting transformations is the spectacle of action heroes-who would normally be racing to save the day-placidly reveling in domesticity. These include Arnold Schwarzenegger smoking a cigar in his hot tub and feeding carrots to his donkey and miniature horse at his kitchen table; Sam Neill petting a duck and bird-calling; Patrick Stewart in an armchair reading Shakespeare's

63fa45c16f6687fe53e3e519a883eb73274036ba	Clustering individuals into similar groups in longitudinal studies can improve time series models by combining information across like individuals. While there is a well developed literature for clustering of time series, these approaches tend to generate clusters independently of the model training procedure which can lead to poor model fit. We propose a novel method that simultaneously clusters and fits autoregression models for groups of similar individuals. We apply a Wishart mixture model so as to cluster individuals while modeling the corresponding autocorrelation matrices at the same time. The fitted Wishart scale matrices map to cluster-level autoregressive coefficients through the Yule-Walker equations, fitting robust parsimonious autoregressive mixture models. This approach is able to discern differences in underlying serial variation of time series while accounting for an individual's intrinsic variability. We prove consistency of our cluster membership estimator and compare our approach against competing methods through simulation as well as by modeling regional COVID-19 infection rates.
2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2	a b s t r a c t STAT1 belongs to the STAT family of transcription factors, which comprises seven factors: STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B and STAT6. STAT1 is a 91 kDa protein originally identified as the mediator of the cellular response to interferon (IFN) a, and thereafter found to be a major component of the cellular response to IFNg. STAT1 is, in fact, involved in the response to several cytokines and to growth factors. It is activated by cytokine receptors via kinases of the JAK family. STAT1 becomes phosphorylated and forms a dimer which enters the nucleus and triggers the transcription of its targets. Although not lethal at birth, selective gene deletion of STAT1 in mice leads to rapid death from severe infections, demonstrating its major role in the response to pathogens. Similarly, in humans who do not express STAT1, there is a lack of resistance to pathogens leading to premature death. This indicates a key, non-redundant function of STAT1 in the defence against pathogens. Thus, to successfully infect organisms, bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens must overcome the activity of STAT1, and almost all the steps of this pathway can be blocked or inhibited by proteins produced in infected cells. Interestingly, some pathogens, like the oncogenic EpsteineBarr virus, have evolved a strategy which uses STAT1 activation.
bb8a9e29bc65471177f470285c32d879c2cb7263	During outbreaks of high-consequence pathogens, airport screening programs have been deployed to curtail geographic spread of infection. The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases.

This study examined the determinants of the timing to implement an intervention. Through an impact analysis, the study explored the effects of the interventions and the potential risks of removing them under the context of reopening the economy. Method A content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which states enacted these strategies. A proportional hazard model, a multiple-event survival model, and a random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis.

We retrospectively collected the data from the hospital records including follow up. Mean age of the patients was 18.48Â±7.53 years. Bioprosthetic valve size ranged from 19mm to 25mm. There was no early or late mortality. No patient had developed low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), acute renal failure, ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, or sepsis. Follow-up was complete and at a mean duration of 41.3 ±10.4 months, no patient required reoperation or re-interventions. Mean QRS duration, RV function, RV end systolic and end diastolic dimensions, Prosthetic valve gradient, RV myocardial performance index and Functional status(including NYHA class and 6-minute walk test) were not significantly different as compared to pre-discharge value. During follow-up, 2 patients (5.4%) developed moderate PR, and 2 patients (5.4%) developed moderate PS. Concomitant PVR with TOF repair in adult provides excellent early and midterm outcome, with acceptable rate of pulmonary valve degeneration at midterm. It not only smoothens the early postoperative course but, also preserves the right ventricular function as well as functional status at mid-term.

Mice would 17 be an attractive system for such studies, but ZIKV replicates poorly in laboratory mice because it 18 fails to antagonize murine STAT2 and STING. To address this, most ZIKV pathogenesis studies 19 have used mice with impaired interferon signaling (e.g. Ifnar1 -/or treatment with IFNAR1-blocking 20 antibodies). However, using mice with severe defects in innate antiviral signaling confounds 21 studies of viral pathogenic mechanisms. Collaborative Cross (CC) mice have proven to be a 22 valuable system for developing new mouse pathogenesis models for viral infections that are not 23 well modeled in conventional laboratory mouse lines. To test whether CC mice could provide an 24 immune-competent model for ZIKV pathogenesis, we infected CC lines with ZIKV and assessed 25 weight loss, viremia, and production of neutralizing antibodies.

In this article we study the temporal evolution of the pandemic Sars-Cov-2 in Italy by means of dynamic population models. The time window of the available population data is between February 24 and March 25. After we upgrade the data until April 1. We perform the analysis with 4 different models and we think that the best candidate to correctly described the italian situation is a generalized Logistic equation. We use two coupled differential equations that model the evolution of the severe infected and the dead. This choice is due to the fact that in Italy the pharyngeal swabs are made only to severe infected, therefore we have no information about asymptomatic people. Moreover, an important observation is that the virus spreads between Regions with some delay. Indeed, we suggest that a different analysis, region by region, would be more sensible than one on the whole Italy. In particular the region Lombardy has a behaviour very fast compared to the other ones. We show the fit and forecast of the dead and total severe infected for Italy and five regions: Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Tuscany. Finally we perform an analysis of the peak (intended, in our study, as the maximum of the daily total severe infected) and an estimation of how many lives have been saved by means of the LockDown.

This paper proposes a novel technique based on this observation. Roughly speaking, a given quantified bit-vector formula is reduced and sent to a solver, an obtained model is then extended to the original bit-widths and verified against the original formula. We also present an experimental evaluation demonstrating that this technique can significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art smt solvers Boolector, CVC4, and Q3B on quantified bit-vector formulas from the smt-lib repository. ϕ ≡ ∀x∀y∃z (x · (y + z) = 0) J.

Usually detection of coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time RT-PCR method, but it must be long time that RNA is treated by extraction, concentration and purification, and detected by RT-PCR method. We modified various methods, of which evaluated if each method is short and simple enough. In another point of the evaluations, surprisingly, Human coronavirus 229E, which was substituted for SARS-CoV-2, could be detected in crude state without treatment in advance of RNA. As that was, it was possible to detect coronavirus with direct RT-PCR. Therefore, it might eliminate wasteful time, avoid secondary infection and risk of contamination. In light of the above two points, SARS-CoV-2 might be detected more quickly and more simply. With using this mobile real-time PCR, these methods should be suitable for not only SARS-CoV-2 but also other various viruses and might save time compared to earlier detection methods.

Participants were 3,109 Turkish adults (Mean age =38.64±10.40) who completed online measures of perceived risk, positivity, death distress, and happiness during the pandemic. Results showed that perceived risk had a significant direct effect on positivity, death distress, and happiness. Positivity had a significant direct effect on death distress and happiness. Mediation analysis indicated that positivity mediated the effect of perceived risk on death distress and happiness. Results suggest that positivity is an important aspect of developing strength-based preventions and interventions aiming to reduce psychological distress and improve happiness.

La avalancha de información relacionada con COVID-19 lleva a la aparición de estudios no revisados por pares, noticias falsas y recomendaciones basadas en ideas no comprobadas que invaden los chats y las redes sociales. De igual manera, al buscar en PubMed el término COVID hay 15.289 publicaciones indexadas, lo cual demuestra el gran interés en el tema. El objetivo de esta revisión de la literatura es presentar la información publicada en relación con arritmias y COVID-19, y mostrar su prevalencia y relación con el pronóstico, los posibles riesgos con los tratamientos y manejos recomendados. Page 3 of 23 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Se han publicado excelentes revisiones de COVID-19 y compromiso cardiovascular 1,2 , en las que se incluye una en la Revista Colombiana de Cardiología 3 . En resumen, algunos síntomas de la infección, como tos, disnea, Para el momento del envío de este escrito no se ha demostrado que algún tratamiento modifique sustancialmente la mortalidad o la admisión a unidad de cuidado intensivo de los pacientes con COVID-19; sin embargo, se han propuesto Page 6 of 23 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f algunos tratamientos con base en resultados in vitro o resultados previos con otros coronavirus. Algunos de ellos pueden tener un efecto proarrítmico. La hidroxicloroquina y la cloroquina se han postulado como posibles tratamientos para la enfermedad por COVID-19 y son recomendadas por el consenso colombiano sulfato de magnesio suprime la taquicardia de puntas torcidas sin acortar el QTc y su mecanismo de acción es posiblemente la suspensión del flujo de calcio a través de la corriente tipo L con reducción en los pospotenciales tempranos 36 . Si el magnesio no suprime la taquicardia de puntas torcidas se debe aumentar la frecuencia cardiaca ya sea con marcapaso (idealmente con estimulación auricular si no hay bloqueo AV) o con isoproterenol. El aumento de la frecuencia cardiaca acorta el QTc y suprime la taquicardia de puntas torcidas 37 . Por último, se puede usar lidocaína. Pese a la utilidad de amiodarona en muchas arritmias ventriculares, en estos casos está contraindicada. No hay estudios específicos en pacientes con Page 16 of 23 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19, pero no hay información que sugiera que haya que cambiar este tratamiento estándar. En la pandemia por COVID-19 se ha encontrado que el antecedente de arritmias confiere mayor riesgo de complicaciones y mortalidad. El desarrollo de éstas durante la enfermedad es indicador de mal pronóstico y se explica parcialmente por daño miocárdico agudo. Por último, algunos tratamientos propuestos son proarrítmicos, fundamentalmente por prolongación del QTc, por lo que hay que establecer medidas diagnósticas, de prevención y tratamiento en estos pacientes debido al riesgo de taquicardia de puntas torcidas y muerte.

b3940a8e9cd829a3346f913119efdb1ffcd8ec77	Highlights d SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 to enter target cells d SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind with similar affinities to ACE2 d Structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in two conformations d SARS-CoV polyclonal antibodies inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spikemediated entry into cells In Brief SARS-CoV-2, a newly emerged pathogen spreading worldwide, binds with high affinity to human ACE2 and uses it as an entry receptor to invade target cells. Cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in two distinct conformations, along with inhibition of spike-mediated entry by SARS-CoV polyclonal antibodies, provide a blueprint for the design of vaccines and therapeutics. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90,000 infections and >3,000 deaths. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S 1 /S 2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.
6522e893e7f5739f96db413b61932c949e5fad2d	Background: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. In addition, it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high (60%) mortality rate. Effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. In the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin (sH5 3 ) produced in mammalian cells. The secreted, purified sH5 3 was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It was shown to protect chickens, in a dosedependent manner, against a lethal challenge with H5N1 after a single vaccination. Protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs. Also in mice, vaccination with sH5 3 provided complete protection against challenge with HPAI H5N1. Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that sH5 3 constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against HPAI H5N1. As these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time, they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.

3b0007032207da7e2af69261ddd6cff5743abe14	28 Objectives: We used viral genomics to deeply analyze the first SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters in the 29 metropolitan region of Hamburg, Germany. Epidemiological analysis and contact tracing together with 30 a thorough investigation of virus variant patterns revealed low and high infection dose transmissions to 31 be involved in transmission events. 32 Methods: Infection control measures were applied to follow up contract tracing. Metagenomic RNA-33 and SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequencing was performed from 25 clinical samples for sequence analysis 34 and variant calling. 35 Results: The index patient acquired SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and after his return to Hamburg transmitted 36 it to 2 out of 132 contacts. Virus genomics and variant pattern clearly confirms the initial local cluster. 37 We identify frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 241, 3037, 14408, 23403 and 28881 38 previously described in Italian sequences and now considered as one major genotype in Europe. While 39 the index patient showed a single nucleotide polymorphism only one variant was transmitted to the 40 recipients. Different to the initial cluster, we observed in household clusters occurring at the time in 41 Hamburg also intra-host viral species transmission events. 42 Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing highlights both, low infection dose transmissions suggestive 43 of fomites as route of infection in the initial cluster and high and low infection dose transmissions in 44 family clusters indicative of fomites and droplets as infection routes. This suggests (1) single viral 45 particle infection can be sufficient to initiate SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) household/family members 46 are exposed to high virus loads and therefore have a high risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2. 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 All rights reserved.

b91cd45e5add5a4ab9e8971919e32e1a28bcbbe6	Background: Previous findings show that corticosteroid treatment during the first acute wheezing episode may reduce recurrent wheezing in children with high rhinovirus genome load at 12-month follow-up. Longer-term effects have not been investigated prospectively. Methods: After PCR confirmation of rhinovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate, 79 children with the first acute wheezing episode were randomized to receive orally prednisolone or placebo for 3 days. The initiation of asthma control medication before the age of 5 years was confirmed from medical record and/or from parental interview. The outcome was the time to initiation of regular asthma control medication. Interaction analysis examined rhinovirus genome load. Results: Fifty-nine (75%) children completed the follow-up. Asthma control medication was initiated in 40 (68%) children at the median age of 20 months. Overall, prednisolone did not affect the time to initiation of asthma control medication when compared to placebo (P=.99). Rhinovirus load modified the effect of prednisolone regarding the time to initiation of asthma control medication (P-value for interac-tion=.04). In children with high rhinovirus load (>7000 copies/mL; n=23), the risk for initiation of medication was lower in the prednisolone group compared to the placebo group (P=.05). In the placebo group, asthma medication was initiated to all children with high rhinovirus load (n=9) during the 14 months after the first wheezing episode. Overall, prednisolone did not affect the time to initiation of asthma control medication when compared to placebo. However, prednisolone may be beneficial in first-time wheezing children whose episode was severe and associated with high rhinovirus load.

48f35ae92e33c644349f7db0fa8717ead2f13474	It is known that the parameters in the deterministic and stochastic SEIR epidemic models are structurally identifiable. For example, from knowledge of the infected population time series I(t) during the entire epidemic, the parameters can be successfully estimated. In this article we observe that estimation will fail in practice if only infected case data during the early part of the epidemic (pre-peak) is available. This fact can be explained using a long-known phenomenon called dynamical compensation. We use this concept to derive an unidentifiability manifold in the parameter space of SEIR that consists of parameters indistinguishable to I(t) early in the epidemic. Thus, identifiability depends on the extent of the system trajectory that is available for observation. Although the existence of the unidentifiability manifold obstructs the ability to exactly determine the parameters, we suggest that it may be useful for uncertainty quantification purposes. A variant of SEIR recently proposed for COVID-19 modeling is also analyzed, and an analogous unidentifiability surface is derived.
cbf94a39e285133ee4149e4c773a8d347d01e9f0	Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates cellular redox balance and the expression of a wide array of genes involved in immunity and inflammation, including antiviral actions. Nrf2 activity declines with age, making the elderly more susceptible to oxidative stress-mediated diseases, which include type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Published evidence suggests that Nrf2 activity may regulate important mechanisms affecting viral susceptibility and replication. We examined gene expression levels by GeneChip microarray and by RNA-seq assays. We found that the potent Nrf2-activating composition PB125 ® downregulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. ACE2 is a surface receptor and TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Furthermore, in endotoxin-stimulated primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, we report the marked downregulation by PB125 of 36 genes encoding cytokines. These include IL-1-beta, IL-6, TNF-α, the cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, and a group of IFN-γ-induced genes. Many of these cytokines have been specifically identified in the "cytokine storm" observed in fatal cases of COVID-19, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may significantly decrease the intensity of the storm.
255e05f7b489ece5c5c60fdf312ba0a3dcffeb37	Background/Purpose: Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 is recognized in association with upper or lower respiratory tract illnesses in children. This study surveyed the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 and influenza viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan during 2010 e2011. Methods: Throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza-like illness were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus-specific primers, and then virus-positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Results: HCoV-NL63 infection was identified in 8.4% (9/107) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16e25 years (20%) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups, and exhibited a similar age-specific pattern to influenza A/H1N1 infection, but not influenza A/H3N2 and B infections in hospitalized patients. Seasonal prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection was late winter, overlapping the highest peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic during
f51d2026c0cdb066b9ed469983f77e4b3cccaef6	With the multiplication of COVID-19 cases due to SARS COV2, some concerns about angiotensinconverting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have emerged. Because SARS COV2 utilizes ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as a membrane receptor to enter target cells, the fear that ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. Due to different structural structures with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs.
c8474dbf9fe0d54fd47cf9382296536fb52f1efe	The current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus has required an unusual allocation of resources that can negatively impact of chronically ill patients and high-complexity procedures. Across the European reference network on pediatric transplantation (ERN-TransplantChild) we conducted a survey to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on pediatric transplant activity and healthcare practices in both solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) transplantation. The replies of 30 professionals from 18 centers in Europe were collected. Twelve of 18 centers (67%) showed a reduction in their usual transplant activity. Additionally, outpatient visits have been modified, restricted to selected ones and to the use of telemedicine tools has increased. Additionally, a total of 14 COVID-19 pediatric transplanted patients were identified at the time of the survey, including eight transplant recipients and six candidates for transplantation. Only two moderate-severe cases were reported, both in HSCT setting. These survey results demonstrate the limitations in healthcare resources for pediatric transplantation patients during early stages of this pandemic. COVID-19 disease is a major worldwide challenge for the field of pediatric transplantation, where there will be a need for systematic data collection, encouraging regular discussions to address the long-term consequences for pediatric transplantation candidates, recipients and their families.
0b65341c3090421acaac37ec4c93212277be55bb	African swine fever (ASF) is a pathology of pigs against which there is no treatment or vaccine. Understanding the equilibrium between innate and adaptive protective responses and immune pathology might contribute to the development of strategies against ASFV. Here we compare, using a proteomic approach, the course of the in vivo infection caused by two homologous strains: the virulent E75 and the attenuated E75CV1. Our results show a progressive loss of proteins by day 7 post-infection (pi) with E75, reflecting tissue destruction. Many signal pathways were affected by both infections but in different ways and extensions. Cytoskeletal remodelling and clathrin-endocytosis were affected by both isolates, while a greater number of proteins involved on inflammatory and immunological pathways were altered by E75CV1. 14-3-3 mediated signalling, related to immunity and apoptosis, was inhibited by both isolates. The implication of the Rho GTPases by E75CV1 throughout infection is also evident. Early events reflected the lack of E75 recognition by the immune system, an evasion strategy acquired by the virulent strains, and significant changes at 7 days post-infection (dpi), coinciding with the peak of infection and the time of death. The protein signature at day 31 pi with E75CV1 seems to reflect events observed at 1 dpi, including the upregulation of proteosomal subunits and molecules described as autoantigens (vimentin, HSPB1, enolase and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1), which allow the speculation that auto-antibodies could contribute to chronic ASFV infections. Therefore, the use of proteomics could help understand ASFV pathogenesis and immune protection, opening new avenues for future research. © The Author(s) 2018.

ede83e7f1595758eb21163e1e432ea3a22ca7b7b	In this chapter, we will discuss concepts of information diffusion in social networks. We are interested in knowing how a piece of information (knowledge) is spread through a network. These may be computer viruses spreading on the Internet or a network of computers, diseases through a social network, or rumors and ideas through a social network. Information diffusion methods are commonly used in viral marketing, in collaborative filtering systems, in emergency management, in community detection, and in the study of citation networks. We will present, in detail, two general types of information diffusion in social networks: diffusion of innovation and epidemics. Diffusion of innovation is studied in many fields, but in this chapter, we are considering it only from a social network perspective. Other kinds of information diffusion that are not included in this chapter include herd behavior and information cascades.
ac1be9c13b571359bb954195273ce3633dfd1aa1	Background: Approximately 75% of all bicycle-related mortality is secondary to head injuries, 85% of which could have been prevented by wearing a bicycle helmet. Younger children appear to be at greater risk than adults, yet helmet use is low despite this risk and legislation and ordinances requiring helmet use among younger riders. We sought to determine whether bicycle helmets are associated with the incidence and severity of head injury among pediatric bicyclists involved in a bicycle crash involving a motor vehicle. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients age ≤ 18 years hospitalized at a level I pediatric trauma center between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018. Data were abstracted from the institutional trauma registry and electronic medical record. International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th editions and external causes of injury codes were used to identify MV related bicycle crashes and determine the abbreviated injury severity (AIS) for head injury severity. Injury narratives were reviewed to determine helmet use. We calculated the incidence of head injury from bicycle vs. MV crashes utilizing descriptive statistics. We analyzed the risk and severity of injury utilizing univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Overall, 226 bicyclists were treated for injuries from being struck by a MV. The median age was 11 (interquartile range (IQR): 8 to 13) years. Helmeted bicyclists (n = 26, 27%) were younger (9.4 years versus 10.8 years, p = 0.04), and were less likely (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.49) to be diagnosed with a head injury compared to unhelmeted bicyclists (n = 199). Of those with a head injury, helmeted bicyclists were less likely (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11-2.82) to sustain severe or higher injury using AIS. When adjusting for demographics (age, sex, race) and injury severity, helmet use predicted a reduction in head injury (OR 6.02, 95% CI 2.4-15.2). Conclusions: Bicycle helmet use was associated with reduced odds of head injury and severity of injury.. These results support the use of strategies to increase the uptake of bicycle helmets wearing as part of a comprehensive youth bicycling injury prevention program.
db441b9adcaa2bdc7a568ad7d67653a07533deb8	Effective treatment interventions for childhood obesity involve parents, are multicomponent and use behavior change strategies, but more information is needed on the mechanisms influencing behavioral outcomes and the type of parental involvement that is efficacious in behavioral treatment interventions with school-age children. This review aimed to understand key characteristics of programs that contribute to dietary and physical activity behavioral outcomes, and through which key mechanisms. This was a systematic review with narrative synthesis following PRISMA guidelines and realist analysis using RAMESES guidelines to explain outcome patterns and influence of parental involvement. Overall, the findings contribute to understanding the complex relationship between family barriers to behavior change, strategies employed in treatment interventions and behavioral outcomes. Implications for enhancing future policy and practice include involving parents in goal setting, motivational counselling, role modeling, and restructuring the physical environment to promote mutual empowerment of both parents and children, shared value and whole-family ownership in which intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy are implicit. These characteristics were associated with positive dietary and physical activity behavior change in children and may be useful considerations for the design and implementation of future theory-based treatment interventions to encourage habitual healthy diet and physical activity to reduce childhood obesity. recommend prevention and treatment of obesity in the primary school years should focus on parents, since this is when life habits are formed [9] . Whilst plenty of recent studies support evidence that parents exert high influence over energy balance behaviors in their children, making their involvement key to the success of child weight-management programs [10, 11] , findings have varied on the extent and for what ages parental involvement is successful [12] . Facilitating sustainable behavior change in children via public health interventions is challenging due to inhibiting influences of social and family barriers to healthy behaviors in participants' wider lives [13] . A lack of parental or whole-family support can also impede new health behaviors being maintained long term [14] . Many authors have acknowledged the importance of parental involvement in childhood obesity treatment interventions and positive health-related outcomes. However, many 'family-based' interventions vary in their level and type of parent/carer involvement. Some interventions have focused on parents as the exclusive agents of change [15, 16] , where key elements consist of strengthening parents' leadership skills, to take the focus off children being identified as the (obese) patient and overcome associated negative psychological issues and resistance to change. Other studies have promoted parent support of the child's behavior change [16, 17] , with parents responsible for creating a supportive environment and empowering children to make informed choices. Finally, some studies have aimed to change both parent and child behaviors simultaneously [18, 19] , with children and parents making behavior change commitments together in the intervention. A recent review of 70 RCTs (64 multicomponent, involving both parent and child) on the effects of diet, physical activity and behavior change interventions for overweight children [20] concluded that multicomponent interventions that incorporate diet, physical activity and behavior change strategies may be beneficial in achieving small short-term reductions in BMI, BMIz and weight in children aged 6-11 years. However, only a handful of the 56 studies that measured behavior change outcomes actually reported behavioral outcomes related to dietary (n = 2 studies) or physical activity (n = 8 studies) behavior change, and the review called for standardized reporting of key outcomes and mechanisms of behavior change. Implementation challenges associated with interventions based on behavioral theory present barriers to upscaling and translation into natural settings due to a lack of contextual information on factors that influence behavioral lifestyle outcomes [21] [22] [23] . In the past decade, systematic reviews of child and family-focused treatment interventions targeting obesity-related behavior change in overweight children have indicated small positive short-term outcomes on dietary and physical activity behaviors [5, 24] . However, high heterogeneity across included studies (varied methodologies, settings, and intervention strategies) has been common to most systematic reviews, limiting the applicability of the findings and providing insufficient evidence for policy relevance or to support upscaling [5, 25] . Overall, a better understanding is needed of patterns of outcomes across the family-based literature, and how the interaction between different program characteristics and behavior change strategies influence lifestyle behaviors such as heathy eating and physical activity in overweight and obese children. The traditional systematic review methodology aims to minimize bias in order to provide a summary of the effectiveness of interventions in terms of their effect sizes. However, this approach can oversimplify the inherently contextual nature of interventions [26-28] and may not account for the complex relationship of interactions between context, mechanisms and outcomes [29] . As a result, realist reviews are emerging as an alternative 'theory-driven' approach to systematic reviews in public health research, as they are particularly relevant for understanding complex multicomponent interventions such as those prioritizing childhood obesity. However, there are currently no realist reviews on family-based behavior change interventions for overweight and obese children, measuring multiple obesity-related behavioral lifestyle outcomes and focusing on parental involvement. This review aimed to enrich understanding of the ways child-focused behavior change treatment interventions contribute to reported obesity-related behavioral outcomes (specifically diet and physical activity behavioral outcomes as opposed to interventions based on healthy eating and physical activity behaviors for preventing obesity) and the influence of specific program characteristics and mechanisms. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4099 3 of 26 The overall objective was to understand the key characteristics of programs that contribute to positive dietary and physical activity behavioral outcomes, and through which key mechanisms. More specifically, we aimed to explore;
65e06f3980bdecbbbfc2f5018f79ec9ae44f3d04	A rapid review was performed to determine (1) the number and causes of reported laboratory-acquired infections (LAI) in the Asia-Pacific region; (2) their significance and threat to the community; (3) the primary risk factors associated with LAIs; (4) the consequences in the event of a LAI or pathogen escape; and (5) to make general recommendations regarding biosafety practices for diagnosis and research in the Asia-Pacific region. A search for LAI and zoonoses in the Asia-Pacific region using online search engines revealed a relatively low number of reports. Only 27 LAI reports were published between 1982 and 2016. The most common pathogens associated with LAIs were dengue virus, Arthroderma spp., Brucella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Rickettsia spp., and Shigella spp. Seventy-eight percent (21 out of 27 LAI reports) occurred in high-income countries (i.e., Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) where laboratories were likely to comply with international biosafety standards. Two upper-middle income countries (China (2), and Malaysia (2)) and one lower-middle income country (India (2)) reported LAI incidents. The majority of the reports (fifty-two percent (14/27)) of LAIs occurred in research laboratories. Five LAI reports were from clinical or diagnostic laboratories that are considered at the frontier for zoonotic disease detection. Governments and laboratories in the Asia-Pacific region should be encouraged to report LAI cases as it provides a useful tool to monitor unintended release of zoonotic pathogens and to further improve laboratory biosafety. Non-reporting of LAI events could pose a risk of disease transmission from infected laboratory staff to communities and the environment. The international community has an important and continuing role to play in supporting laboratories in the Asia-Pacific region to ensure that they maintain the safe working environment for the staff and their families, and the wider community.
965d1e2a8963b80e427168cad57d88637fbc2d96	The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has or threatens to overwhelm health care systems. Many institutions are developing ventilator triage policies. Objective: To characterize the development of ventilator triage policies and compare policy content. Design: Survey and mixed-methods content analysis. Setting: North American hospitals associated with members of the Association of Bioethics Program Directors. Measurements: Characteristics of institutions and policies, including triage criteria and triage committee membership. Results: Sixty-seven program directors responded (response rate, 91.8%); 36 (53.7%) hospitals did not yet have a policy, and 7 (10.4%) hospitals' policies could not be shared. The 29 institutions providing policies were relatively evenly distributed among the 4 U.S. geographic regions (range, 5 to 9 policies per region). Among the 26 unique policies analyzed, 3 (11.3%) were produced by state health departments. The most frequently cited triage criteria were benefit (25 policies [96.2%]), need (14 [53.8%]), age (13 [50.0%]), conservation of resources (10 [38.5%]), and lottery (9 [34.6%]). Twenty-one (80.8%) policies use scoring systems, and 20 of these (95.2%) use a version of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Among the policies that specify the triage team's composition (23 [88.5%]), all require or recommend a physician member, 20 (87.0%) a nurse, 16 (69.6%) an ethicist, 8 (34.8%) a chaplain, and 8 (34.8%) a respiratory therapist. Thirteen (50.0% of all policies) require or recommend those making triage decisions not be involved in direct patient care, but only 2 (7.7%) require that their decisions be blinded to ethically irrelevant considerations. The results may not be generalizable to institutions without academic bioethics programs. Over one half of respondents did not have ventilator triage policies. Policies have substantial heterogeneity, and many omit guidance on fair implementation.
ab3c4f88e655875b72719f078f4e1e4fd4459445	Children are more vulnerable to the risks of air pollution, including susceptibility to acquiring chronic diseases in their developing lungs. Despite these, there are no specific masks designed for and tested in children that are available to protect our young from the common particulate air pollutants today. We evaluated safety, fit and comfort of a specially designed paediatric N95 mask with an optional micro ventilator (micro fan, MF) in healthy children aged 7-14 years, in a randomized, two-period crossover design. The subjects' cardiorespiratory physiological measurements were assessed in different states of physical activity under different interventions (mask without and with MF). A total of 106 subjects were recruited between July-August 2016. The use of the mask without MF increased the End-Tidal CO 2 (etco 2 ) and fractional concentration of inspired co 2 (fico 2 ) at rest and on mild exertion, as expected. The use of the mask with MF brought FICO 2 levels comparably closer to baseline levels without the mask for both activities. The mask, with or without the MF, was found to be well fitting, comfortable and safe for use in children at rest and on mild exertion. The N95 mask tested offers a promising start for more studies in the paediatric population. Air pollution, such as haze or smog, is an evolving and increasingly significant problem around the world. A wide range of hazards of chronic air pollution in children include nocturnal cough, asthma, poor performance in neurobehavioral function, negative impact in cognitive development and harmful effects on brain development 1-5 . In particular, children represent a vulnerable segment of any population. They carry more risks of long term exposure to pollution over the course of their lives and are susceptible to acquiring chronic diseases in their developing lungs 6-11 . Use of masks and respirators can offer protection against air pollutants. However, the commercially available disposable particulate respirators, typically certified for surgical (which may only offer some barrier against larger particles) and occupational use, are mainly designed for and studied in adults. The test standards are specified according to adult breathing conditions and fit. There are to date, no masks designed for and evaluated in children. Several studies have investigated the effectiveness, safety, fit and comfort of different types of masks 12-15 . However these studies were done only in adult populations. Even alternatives such as cloth masks have been tested only in adult populations 16 . In another study, the facemasks for paediatric use (FPU, the masks that are not specifically designed for paediatric use but are the existing mask that may be used for children during emergency situation like that of airborne disease outbreaks) were tested mainly to evaluate the leakage associated with donning the FPU 17 . This study did show superiority of FPU in comparison to surgical masks in certain aspects, however, the study was not performed in children. One study was performed in children to evaluate the redesigned open system face mask. However, the objective of this study was to evaluate the mask for monitoring P ETCO2 during sedation in clinical practice and the children in this study donned the mask only for 30 sec. 18 . These and other similar studies merely point to the fact that there are no masks that are specifically designed and tested in children such that they can be prescribed for paediatric use in the setting of daily routine activities. In our study, the N95 masks were specifically designed for use in children and they were evaluated in children under conditions of routine daily activities. They are the first to be paired with a micro ventilator (micro fan, MF), designed to reduce the accumulation of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), heat and humidity in the dead space of

A clear evidence-based guide to aid the design of serological studies is critical to policy makers and public health officials both for estimation of seroprevalence and for forward-looking modeling efforts, particularly if serological positivity reflects immune protection. To address this need, we developed a framework that can be used to design and interpret serological studies, with applicability to SARS-CoV-2. Starting with results from a serological survey of a given size and age stratification, the framework incorporates the test's sensitivity and specificity and enables estimates of population seroprevalence that include uncertainty. These estimates can then be used in models of disease spread to calculate the effective reproductive number R eff , the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 under partial immunity, to forecast disease dynamics, and to assess the impact of candidate public health and clinical interventions. Similarly, starting with a pre-specified tolerance for uncertainty in seroprevalence estimates, the framework can be used to define the sample size needed. This framework can be used in conjunction with any model, including ODE models (3, 4), agent-based simulations (5), or network simulations (6), and can be used to estimate R eff or to simulate transmission dynamics.
98b07ff87d658b09a3284a78b88ebe5687475d5a	Background: Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules bind, and present to T cells, short peptides derived from intracellular processing of proteins. The peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is to a large extent determined by the molecular structure accommodating socalled main anchor positions of the presented peptide. These receptors are extremely polymorphic, and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide-binding repertoire. However, despite this polymorphism, class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. Almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and defined nine different groups, denominated as supertypes, on the basis of their main anchor specificity. The utility of this original supertype classification, as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others, has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies. Results: Following our original approach, in the present report we provide an updated classification of HLA-A and -B class I alleles into supertypes. The present analysis incorporates the large amount of class I MHC binding data and sequence information that has become available in the last decade. As a result, over 80% of the 945 different HLA-A and -B alleles examined to date can be assigned to one of the original nine supertypes. A few alleles are expected to be associated with repertoires that overlap multiple supertypes. Interestingly, the current analysis did not identify any additional supertype specificities. As a result of this updated analysis, HLA supertype associations have been defined for over 750 different HLA-A and -B alleles. This information is expected to facilitate epitope identification and vaccine design studies, as well as investigations into disease association and correlates of immunity. In addition, the approach utilized has been made more transparent, allowing others to utilize the classification approach going forward.
3ed90c7a74a7578c4d533588955c2359167e6080	Background: In the pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR is one of the pillars on which countermeasures are based. Factors limiting the output of laboratories interfere with the effectiveness of public health measures. Conserving reagents by pooling samples in lowprobability settings is proposed, but may cause dilution and loss of sensitivity. Blood transfusion services had experience in performance of high throughput NAT analysis and can support the national health system by screening of the inhabitants for SARS-COV-2. Methods: We evaluated a new approach of a multiple swab method by simultaneously incubating multiple respiratory swabs in a single tube. Analytical sensitivity was constant up to a total number of 50 swabs. It was consequently applied in the testing of 50 symptomatic patients (five-sample pools) as well as 100 asymptomatic residents of a nursing home (tensample pools). Results: The novel method did not cause false negative results with non-significantly differing Ct values between single swab and multiple swab NAT. In two routine applications, all mini pools containing positive patient samples were correctly identified. Conclusions: The new method enables countries to increase the total number of testing significantly. The multiple swab method is able to screen system relevant groups of employees frequently. Secondly the example in Germany shows that blood transfusion services can support general health systems with their experience in NAT and their high throughput instruments. Screening of a huge number of inhabitants is currently the only option to prevent a second infection wave and enable exit strategies in many countries.
743c5db7611d4af74204901e0ed3b6317a0bb3c4	Background: Effective influenza pandemic management requires understanding of the factors influencing behavioral changes. We aim to determine the differences in knowledge, attitudes and practices in various different cohorts and explore the pertinent factors that influenced behavior in tropical Singapore. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices survey in the Singapore military from mid-August to early-October 2009, among 3054 personnel in four exposure groups -laboratory-confirmed H1N1-2009 cases, close contacts of cases, healthcare workers, and general personnel. Results: 1063 (34.8%) participants responded. The mean age was 21.4 (SE 0.2) years old. Close contacts had the highest knowledge score (71.7%, p = 0.004) while cases had the highest practice scores (58.8%, p < 0.001). There was a strong correlation between knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.27, p < 0.01) and knowledge and attitudes scores (r = 0.21, p < 0.01). The significant predictors of higher practice scores were higher knowledge scores (p < 0.001), Malay ethnicity (p < 0.001), exposure group (p < 0.05) and lower education level (p < 0.05). The significant predictors for higher attitudes scores were Malay ethnicity (p = 0.014) and higher knowledge scores (p < 0.001). The significant predictor for higher knowledge score was being a contact (p = 0.007). Knowledge is a significant influence on attitudes and practices in a pandemic, and personal experience influences practice behaviors. Efforts should be targeted at educating the general population to improve practices in the current pandemic, as well as for future epidemics. *Between patients, contacts, healthcare workers and general servicemen **Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed) † Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) † † Corrected for age, sex, education, housing and ethnicity Yap et al.
014a55cb08ccc365edec9cc8366705b4c629a534	This paper examines the impact of Covid-19 on community-based violence interventions, especially hospital-based violence interventions and street outreach organizations. Guided by our work in Rochester, New York, we explore how the emergence of covid-19, and the subsequent social restrictions, have hampered the ability of community-based organizations to respond to violence. We also examine ways that community-based organizations can adapt to the challenges associated with Covid-19 and continue providing services to the community.
841f9e05ca03c0653bc912abb25f8b8b66cab531	CAPTCHA is a human-centred test to distinguish a human operator from bots, attacking programs, or other computerised agent that tries to imitate human intelligence. In this research, we investigate a way to crack visual CAPTCHA tests by an automated deep learning based solution. The goal of this research is to investigate the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the CAPTCHA generator systems; hence, developing more robust CAPTCHAs, without taking the risks of manual try and fail efforts. We develop a Convolutional Neural Network called Deep-CAPTCHA to achieve this goal. The proposed platform is able to investigate both numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs. To train and develop an efficient model, we have generated a dataset of 500,000 CAPTCHAs to train our model. In this paper, we present our customised deep neural network model, we review the research gaps, the existing challenges, and the solutions to cope with the issues. Our network's cracking accuracy leads to a high rate of 98.94% and 98.31% for the numerical and the alpha-numerical test datasets, respectively. That means more works is required to develop robust CAPTCHAs, to be noncrackable against automated artificial agents. As the outcome of this research, we identify some efficient techniques to improve the security of the CAPTCHAs, based on the performance analysis conducted on the Deep-CAPTCHA model.

aef63bcba33e2bc1d7a7f1c3e71d7313e2769d98	Conditional ligands have enabled the high-throughput production of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) libraries that present defined peptides. Immunomonitoring platforms typically concentrate on restriction elements associated with European ancestry, and such tools are scarce for Asian HLA variants. We report 30 novel irradiation-sensitive ligands, specifically targeting South East Asian populations, which provide 93, 63, and 79% coverage for HLA-A, -B, and -C, respectively. Unique ligands for all 16 HLA types were constructed to provide the desired soluble HLA product in sufficient yield. Peptide exchange was accomplished for all variants as demonstrated by an ELISA-based MHC stability assay. HLA tetramers with redirected specificity could detect antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses against human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B (HBV), dengue virus (DENV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. The potential of this population-centric HLA library was demonstrated with the characterization of seven novel T-cell epitopes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, HBV, and DENV. Posthoc analysis revealed that the majority of responses would be more readily identified by our unbiased discovery approach than through the application of state-of-the-art epitope prediction. This flow cytometry-based technology therefore holds considerable promise for monitoring clinically relevant antigen-specific T-cell responses in populations of distinct ethnicity.

8ab1f33d1a58ad6228b01afa9387e4237ccdabe6	Résumé Les bronchopneumopathies communautaires de l'enfant sont fréquentes et entraînent une morbidité importante. Elles peuvent se décomposer en bronchiolites, qui sont toutes d'origine virale, bronchites (ou trachéobronchites), qui sont aussi d'origine virale le plus souvent (80 %) et qui se surinfectent parfois, pneumopathies qui sont potentiellement graves et qui sont dues à une bactérie (60 %), un virus (40 %) ou aux deux (coïnfection : 20 %). L'impossibilité d'écarter un processus bactérien lors d'une pneumopathie implique la mise en route rapide d'une antibiothérapie probabiliste. Community-acquired bronchopneumonia is very common in children and responsible for a great morbidity. It can be revealed by bronchiolitis, due to viral infection, bronchitis (80% due to viruses), and pneumonia potentially much more severe due to bacteria (60%), viruses (40%) or both causes (20%). Being unable to exclude a bacterial origin in pneumonia leads physicians to prescribe systematically antibiotics.
1480a96aebe78b443dfb5d04a3cc84f543af13fe	Several investigations have shown that pentoxifylline possesses broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a range of RNA and DNA viruses. However, its ability to inhibit Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) replication has not yet been studied. The present study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of pentoxifylline against JEV in vitro and in vivo. The activity of pentoxifylline against JEV was evaluated in vitro using cytopathic effect inhibition and plaque reduction assays. Pentoxifylline was able to inhibit JEV replication in a dose-dependent manner at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 50.3 g/mL (0.00018 M) and a therapeutic index (TI) of 10. Experiments to study the mechanism of antiviral action of pentoxifylline using in vitro translation of viral mRNA suggested that the drug did not interfere either with early or late protein synthesis but most likely exerted its action on virus assembly and/or release. Furthermore, the in vivo study showed that pentoxifylline at a concentration of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight was able to protect completely mice challenged with 50 × 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of JEV.
5718d0d4a4b57e3196e7ff8cb56bc6d7e0858671	Intriguing unforced regularities in human behaviors have been reported in varied research domains, including scientometrics. In this study we examine the manuscript submission behavior of researchers, with a focus on its monthly pattern. With a large and reliable dataset which records the submission history of articles published on 10 multidisciplinary journals and 10 management journals over a five-year period (2013-2017), we observe a prominent turn-of-the-month submission effect for accepted papers in management journals but not multidisciplinary journals. This effect gets more pronounced in submissions to top-tier journals and when the first day of a month happens to be a Saturday or Sunday. Sense of ceremony is proposed as a likely explanation of this effect, since the first day of a month is a fundamental temporal landmark which has a 'fresh start effect' on researchers. To conclude, an original and interesting day-of-the-month effect in the academia is reported in this study, which calls for more research attention.
d40392762617c34c3388854f80f9f21523b6e047	Contact tracing and lockdown are health policies being used worldwide to combat the coronavirus . While easing lockdown, the UK National Health Service (NHS) launched its Track and Trace Service at the end of May 2020, and aims by end of June 2020 also to include app-based notification and advice to self-isolate for those who have been in contact with a person known to have COVID-19. To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. To measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE) -the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Observational study of 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% of whom completed a novel questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation --related or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N = 12,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded 'no', 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5-6/10 (OR for 1-2/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48 -0.67]; OR for 3-4/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64 -0.87]), whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase. Those reporting an unconfirmed belief of having previously had and recovered from COVID-19 were 27% less likely to be willing to download the app; belief of previous recovery from ). In this large UK-wide questionnaire of wellbeing in lockdown, a willingness for app-based contact tracing is 60% -close to the estimated 56% population uptake, and substantially less than the smartphone-user uptake considered necessary for an app-based contact-tracing to be an effective intervention to help suppress an epidemic. Given this marginal level of support over an appropriate age range, the impacts of difficulty comprehending government advice and a policy of not testing to confirm self-reported COVID-19 infection during lockdown indicate that uncertainty in communication and diagnosis in adopted public health policies will negatively impact the effectiveness of a government contact tracing app.
5deab2fd52284a43b2fe49b9bd9fef5064408a67	Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) are among the most commonly used cells for the study of interactions between chicken hosts and H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV). In this study, the expression of eleven housekeeping genes typically used for the normalization of quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) analysis in mammals were compared in CEFs infected with H5N1 AIV to determine the most reliable reference genes in this system. CEFs cultured from 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos were infected with 100 TCID 50 of H5N1 AIV and harvested at 3, 12, 24 and 30 hours post-infection. The expression levels of the eleven reference genes in infected and uninfected CEFs were determined by real-time PCR. Based on expression stability and expression levels, our data suggest that the ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ) are the best reference genes to use in the study of host cell response to H5N1 AIV infection. However, for the study of replication levels of H5N1 AIV in CEFs, the β-actin gene (ACTB) and the ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) gene are the best references.
aa552fc202b12219ed29de5e46a5e2ebf9586274	Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is commonly used to screen for pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) in neonates and young infants. However, in the absence of sufficient tricuspid regurgitation (TR), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), or a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) becomes challenging. Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) is an alternate parameter that is easy to obtain in almost all patients and does not require the presence of tricuspid valvar regurgitation or an anatomical cardiac defect. We sought to examine the correlation of PAAT with estimated SPAP by TTE and create an equation to estimate the SPAP using PAAT. We performed a retrospective review of TTEs performed on neonates and young infants (4 months of age or younger) at our institution between April 2017 and December 2018, along with the corresponding medical records. We included TTEs that provided estimation for SPAP and at least one PAAT measurement. During the study period, 138 TTEs performed on 82 patients met the inclusion criteria. Strong correlation was delineated between PAAT and SPAP estimated by the maximum velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation Doppler, correlation coefficient (r) = − 0.83. Moderate correlation was detected between PAAT and SPAP estimated by PDA Doppler, r = − 0.66. Utilizing the following equation "SPAP = 82.6 − 0.58 × PAAT + RA mean pressure", PAAT can be used to estimate SPAP in neonates and young infants. PAAT can be used as an alternative to TR jet to assess SPAP when the latter is absent or insufficient. Further studies are needed to verify the accuracy of this equation.

85a16ac544ae407ea26920d469f00ec846f37c34	The paper presents a feasibility study for heart rate measurement using a digital camera to perform health monitoring. The feasibility study investigates the reliability of the state of the art heart rate measuring methods in realistic situations. Therefore, an experiment was designed and carried out on 45 subjects to investigate the effects caused by illumination, motion, skin tone, and distance variance. The experiment was conducted for two main scenarios; human-computer interaction scenario and health monitoring scenario. The human-computer scenario investigated the effects caused by illumination variance, motion variance, and skin tone variance. The health monitoring scenario investigates the feasibility of health monitoring at public spaces (i.e. airports, subways, malls). Five state of the art heart rate measuring methods were re-implemented and tested with the feasibility study database. The results were compared with ground truth to estimate the heart rate measurement error. The heart rate measurement error was analyzed using mean error, standard deviation; root means square error and Pearson correlation coefficient. The findings of this experiment inferred promising results for health monitoring of subjects standing at a distance of 500 cm.
4095056a635bab5fb9f5e0533c917bfdcd3b0ffc	The Spike is a hallmark coronavirus protein that determines virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We have investigated the Spike from six β-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surfaceexposed fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines has been inferred from comparative studies of their deletion mutant in a fellow murine β-coronavirus MHV-A59 that show significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo. The Spike cleavage-linked priming and fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Summary. The Spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 surface is the prime mediator of COVID-19 1 because of its central role in virus-host attachment, virus-entry, and virus-spread 2 . The contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been attributed to dense glycosylation of the Spike glycoprotein 3 , its high affinity of binding to human ACE2 receptor 4 , and cleavage 5 . While these may be imperative, it does not explain the uncontrolled infectivity. Here we show that properties of the fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop of SARS-CoV-2 Spike that triggers the virus fusion, distinguishes it from the other five β-coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic, including the surface contributed by the fusion peptides. The fusion peptides are structurally rigid owing to its consecutive prolines, aromatic/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive β-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The role of rigidity accrued from the presence of consecutive prolines contributing to virus fusogenicity can be deciphered from our previous murine β-coronavirus, MHV-A59 studies 6 . The synergy brought about by the global location of the surface exposed fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the fusion process, which may explain the severity of the infection and widespread nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.
95bbf76a77c84f207421701360bd37cc5dba0f0e	endemic is growing exponentially in the whole world. Researchers, technologists, doctors and other healthcare workers are working day and night on the development of vaccine and medicinesto control and treat this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus responsible for causing COVID-19 disease, which is highly infectious and lethal.With exponentially increasing infections, proportionate fatalities are being reported both from developed and under developed countries. As of today, more than one million people across the world have been reported infected with this virus, and more than 65,000 people have died of this disease. Hence, there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects of this highly contagious disease, to find effective means of containment and treatment of the disease, for now, and in future. We have identified some opportunities for academic research related to COVID-19 and have also provided suggestions to contain, prevent and treat this viral infection.
dac4e5ddd4e1b0a3ec755a573674371f724462a8	Despite increasing clinical relevance of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection, caused by a rapidly emerging pathogen, recommended guidelines for its inactivation do not exist. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of CHIKV to inactivation by heat and commercially available hand, surface, and World Health Organization-recommended disinfectants to define CHIKV prevention protocols for healthcare systems.
c82c686c1be3bedf289914b5b168082f101881a2	SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent behind COVID-19, exemplifies the general threat to global health posed by coronaviruses. The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we have developed CoV3D, a database and resource for coronavirus protein structures, which is updated on a weekly basis. CoV3D provides users with comprehensive sets of structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Integrated molecular viewers allow users to visualize structures of the spike glycoprotein, which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design efforts, as well as sets of spike-antibody complexes, spike sequence variability, and known polymorphisms. In order to aid structure-based design and analysis of the spike glycoprotein, CoV3D permits visualization and download of spike structures with modeled N-glycosylation at known glycan sites, and contains structure-based classification of spike conformations, generated by unsupervised clustering. CoV3D can serve the research community as a centralized reference and resource for spike and other coronavirus protein structures, and is available at: https://cov3d.
b4d87c8e68bb1fc101f14d3be490fa6142e413b8	Coronaviruses hijack human enzymes to assemble the sugar coat on their spike glycoproteins. The mechanisms by which human antibodies may recognize the antigenic viral peptide epitopes hidden by the sugar coat are unknown. Glycosylation by insect cells differs from the native form produced in human cells, but insect cell-derived influenza vaccines have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In this study, we analyzed recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein secreted from BTI-Tn-5B1-4 insect cells, by trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We acquired tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectrums for glycopeptides of all 22 predicted Nglycosylated sites. We further analyzed the surface accessibility of spike proteins according to cryogenic electron microscopy and homolog-modeled structures, and available antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-1. All 22 N-glycosylated sites of SARS-CoV-2 are modified by highmannose N-glycans. MS/MS fragmentation clearly established the glycopeptide identities. Electron densities of glycans cover most of the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, except YQAGSTPCNGVEGFNCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGYQ, similar to a region FSPDGKPCTPPALNCYWPLNDYGFYTTTGIGYQ in SARS-CoV-1. Other surface-exposed domains include those located on central helix, connecting region, heptad repeats, and Nterminal domain. Because the majority of antibody paratopes bind to the peptide portion with or without sugar modification, we propose a snake-catching model for predicted paratopes: a minimal length of peptide is first clamped by a paratope, and sugar modifications close to the peptide either strengthen or do not hinder the binding.
044d6ebfdeacd8fbdd4f039872020cd4adbbe138	Background: Four sampling techniques commonly are used for antemortem identification of pathogens from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD): the nasal swab (NS), guarded nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and transtracheal wash (TTW). Agreement among these methods has not been well characterized. Objective: To evaluate agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL for identification of viral and bacterial pathogens in dairy calves with BRD. Animals: One hundred dairy calves with naturally acquired BRD. Methods: Calves were sampled by all 4 methods. Viral agents were identified by real-time RT-PCR, bacteria were identified by aerobic culture, and Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) isolates were speciated by PCR. Agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL was evaluated by calculating the kappa statistic and percent positive agreement. McNemar's exact test was used to compare the proportions of positive results. Results: Agreement among TTW and NS, TTW and NPS, and TTW and BAL, was very good for identification of P. multocida, M. haemolytica, and M. bovis. For bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), agreement with TTW was moderate for NS, good for NPS, and very good for BAL. For bovine coronavirus (BCV), agreement with TTW was moderate for NS and NPS, and good for BAL. McNemar's test was significant only for BCV, indicating that for this pathogen the proportion of positive results from NS and NPS could not be considered comparable to TTW. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study provides guidance for veterinarians selecting diagnostic tests for antemortem identification of pathogens associated with BRD.

d9e20259293f9ead8950a4eb61eda2ca377f803e	The possible transport of pathogenic microorganisms during Asian dust events could be an important concern for health workers; however, this is still uncertain owing to a lack of supporting evidence. The present study aimed to investigate the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in air samples collected during the Asian and non-Asian dust periods. Between March and September 2016, air samples were collected at three weather observation stations in Seoul using a high-volume air sampler. Multiplex PCR was performed using the Allplex™ respiratory and gastrointestinal panel assay kits to detect 46 microorganisms. RT-PCR was performed for klassevirus, Aichivirus, and human parechovirus (HPeV) detection. In total, 71 air samples were collected during the Asian (8 samples) and non-Asian (63 samples) dust events. During an Asian dust event, only one human rhinovirus (HRV)-positive air sample was collected on April 23. During the non-Asian dust period, HRV, HPeV, norovirus (NoV), enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and Blastocystis hominis were detected in four, two, one, one, one, and one air samples, respectively. Pathogenic viruses were mostly detected in ambient air samples during the non-Asian dust period, which suggests a possible air-borne transmission of viral pathogens; however, the role of Asian dust in epidemics caused by pathogenic viruses is unclear.

c7332521e26a3081ec9845e8106a43343358b115	Objective: To assess whether vitamin A deficiency alters the recovery of total respiratory resistance (TRR) following acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Methods: This is a case control study of children, age 4-6 years and grouped as: URI, (n ¼ 74), URI and wheezing, (URI-wheezing, n ¼ 52), and healthy controls (n ¼ 51). Vitamin A and total respiratory resistance (TRR) were assessed using the modified relative dose response (MRDR) and forced oscillometry, respectively. Results: Children with URI and URI-wheezing had lower retinol, 32.4 AE 13.12 and 18.3 AE 6.83 mg/dl respectively, compared to controls, 56.9 AE 29.82 mg/dl (ANOVA, P < 0.001). The MRDR was elevated in children in the URI or URIwheezing groups 0.066 AE 0.045 and 0.021 AE 0.021, respectively, compared to controls 0.007 AE 0.006 (ANOVA, P < 0.0001). The TRR in the URI and URI-wheezing groups differed from controls. During convalescence, the TRR failed to decline in the URI-group only when the MRDR was >0.06. In the URI-wheezing group, TRR declined independently of retinol and MRDR. Conclusion: Vitamin A contributes to preservation of airway function during and in recovery after upper respiratory infection in children.
89efa03e2824a0b51ade2d6da3062aa777b9b631	A polyphenolic compound, 1,2,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (1246TGG), was isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Phyllanthus emblica L. (Euphorbiaceae) and assayed for its potential as an anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agent. The cytotoxicity of 1246TGG on HepG2.2.15 as well as HepG2 cells was determined by observing cytopathic effects, and the effects of 1246TGG on secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2.2.15 cells were assayed by enzyme immunoassay. Results indicates that treatment with 1246TGG (6.25 µg/mL, 3.13 µg/mL), reduced both HBsAg and HBeAg levels in culture supernatant, yet the inhibitory effects tend to decline with the assay time. This study provides a basis for further investigation of the anti-HBV activity and possible mechanism of action of 1246TGG.

SSPE patients as well as SAME rats revealed oligoclonal, intrathecal antibody synthesis with MV specificity. SAME rats synthesized MV-specific antibodies intracerebrally to a higher extent than SSPE patients. Although a restricted isoelectric pattern of MV-specific antibodies was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SSPE patients as well as of SAME rats, the heterogeneity within clusters of immunogiobulin bands was higher in the rat specimens. Increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability for albumin was exclusively detected in SAME rats but not in SSPE patients. These data suggest that the rat model offers excellent opportunities to study the initial humoral events in MV-induced encephalitides.

e87480778faffce009192a7d51ca0b9b66038712	Background: Despite efforts aimed at forecasting the course of the pandemic extrapolating from reports of the early onset in Wuhan, China, heterogeneity in the transmission seems to be an important characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 between countries. The study of the progress of the disease with a single set of transmission parameters is complicated by the application of different levels of containment measures at different stages of the pandemic. Methods: We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19 globally and individually for 18 countries. We developed a piecewise fitting methodology to model the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic for a set of countries with a number of confirmed infections in excess of 1000 cases. Our study uses the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model to assess the contagious contact rate (β) of SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of the pandemic as a metric of the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. We extrapolate the results of our fittings to evaluate the effect of a reduction of β on the level of burden laid on local health care infrastructure considering different levels of intervention and to estimate the maximum number of cases and potential peak date to inform future public health interventions. Results: According to the current trend, we project that the peak in the number of infections worldwide will take place after the third quarter of 2020. For 12 out of the 17 countries analyzed, the projections suggest that the number of severe infections will surpass the healthcare capacity. Additionally, it is observed that 4 out of the 17 analyzed will undergo a significant delay in the peak of the infection for a 90% reduction of the transmission rate, and thus extending the course of the epidemic further than the 365 day simulation window.

ece09d9492d3605d3216709a1e178c2d0786b240	As the number of people infected with the newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is continuously increasing every day, development of potential therapeutic platforms is vital. Based on the comparatively high similarity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV, it seems crucial to assay the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with SARS-CoV2 spike (S)-protein. Indeed, developing mAbs targeting SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD could show novel applications for rapid and sensitive development of potential epitope-specific vaccines (ESV). Herein, we present an overview on the discovery of new CoV followed by some explanation on the SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD site. Furthermore, we surveyed the novel therapeutic mAbs for targeting S-protein RBD such as S230, 80R, F26G18, F26G19, CR3014, CR3022, M396, and S230.15. Afterwards, the mechanism of interaction of RBD and different mAbs were explained and it was suggested that one of the SARS-CoV-specific human mAbs, namely CR3022, could show the highest binding affinity with SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future perspective for rapid and sensitive advancement of therapeutic mAbs targeting S-protein RBD were discussed. In conclusion, it may be proposed that this review may pave the way for recognition of RBD and different mAbs to develop potential therapeutic ESV.

7910d4cb3e5e638915032119a150adbef29e4be7	SRL is a reversible programming language conceived as a restriction of imperative programming languages. Each SRL program that mentions n registers defines a bijection on n-tuples of integers. Despite its simplicity, SRL is strong enough to grasp a wide class of computable bijections and to rise non-trivial programming issues. We advance in the study of its expressivity. We show how to choose among alternative program-branches by checking if a given value is positive or negative. So, we answer some longstanding questions that the literature poses. In particular, we prove that SRL is primitive recursive complete and that its program equivalence is undecidable.
190a3e95092a129b94052ac128ce9b690350d9af	A Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) was used to present a truncated dengue virus type 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acids 379 to 423 (EB4). The EB4 gene was inserted at the terminal end of the CGMMV coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF). Read-through sequences of TMV or CGMMV, CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA, or AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA were, respectively, inserted in between the CP and the EB4 genes. The chimeric clones, pRT, pRG, and pCG+FSRTRE, were transcribed into full-length capped recombinant CGMMV transcripts. Only constructs with the wild-type CGMMV read-through sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant, muskmelon (Cucumis melo) leaves. The ratio of modified to unmodified CP for the read-through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1:1, higher than what has been previously reported. It was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in pI between the chimera and its wild counterpart. Analysis of recombinant viruses after 21-days-postinculation (dpi) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct.
f281d9aa38b076714a2210993fbec082cdd0ec80	Simple Summary: Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is a parasitic disease of people and animals transmitted by sand fly vectors. Although dogs in south and central Italy are most affected, in recent decades feline leishmaniosis (FeL) has become an emerging disease. This study aimed to update information on the presence of FeL in stray cats in Milan, in northern Italy; to compare these results with previous studies performed in the same area; and to report aspects of Leishmania infection in cats. A total of 117 stray cats were included and 10 (8.6%) had L. infantum infection. The parasite was identified in popliteal lymph nodes in five cats and five had antibodies against L. infantum. Most infected cats were from a specific area of Milan. Increased gammaglobulins were seen in infected cats, which also had antibodies against the pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Chlamydophila felis, and Toxoplasma gondii. There was a high prevalence of FeL in the surveyed area of northern Italy. Further studies are needed to understand if these infected cats are being imported from other areas, or if there is a real Leishmania focus in Milan. Investigation of the presence of sand fly vectors in Milan would be useful. Abstract: Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) is an emerging vector-borne feline disease, with increasing numbers of cases reported and studies performed internationally. This study aimed to update the epidemiological status for FeL in stray cats in Milan, northern Italy; compare these results with previous studies in Northern Italy; and report clinicopathologic findings and coinfections in cats infected with Leishmania spp. A total of 117 cats were tested for L. infantum and retrovirus infection, hematological, and biochemical parameters. Demographic and clinical data were collected and FeL affected cats screened for selected coinfections. Overall, 10/117 (8.6%) cats tested positive for L. infantum: in five cats L. infantum DNA was found in popliteal lymph nodes and five were IFAT seropositive at titers from 1:80 to 1:160. Infected cats were concentrated in a specific area of Milan (p = 0.0154). No specific clinicopathologic abnormalities or retroviral infections were significantly linked to the infection, other than hypergammaglobulinemia (p = 0.0127). Seroreactivity to Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Chlamydophila felis, and Toxoplasma gondii was found in some infected cats. A high prevalence of FeL was found in a non-endemic area of northern Italy and future studies should continually monitor this data to understand whether these cases are imported or if Leishmania vectors are present in this area.
7faf551b9bf12e8f1f1033ed73fdb5861811e6bf	We propose a new method for novelty detection that can tolerate nontrivial corruption of the training points. Previous works assumed either no or very low corruption. Our method trains a robust variational autoencoder (VAE), which aims to generate a model for the uncorrupted training points. To gain robustness to corruption, we incorporate three changes to the common VAE: 1. Modeling the latent distribution as a mixture of Gaussian inliers and outliers, while using only the inlier component when testing; 2. Applying the Wasserstein-1 metric for regularization, instead of Kullback-Leibler divergence; and 3. Using a least absolute deviation error for reconstruction, which is equivalent to assuming a heavy-tailed likelihood. We illustrate state-of-the-art results on standard benchmark datasets for novelty detection. * Equal contribution. Preprint. Under review.
59cee2c2d1c8e2b5c732523f10682153c278395c	In contrast to −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) stimulation by an RNA pseudoknot downstream of frameshifting sites, a refolding upstream RNA hairpin juxtaposing the frameshifting sites attenuates −1 PRF in human cells and stimulates +1 frameshifting in yeast. This eukaryotic functional mimicry of the internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence-mediated duplex was confirmed directly in the 70S translation system, indicating that both frameshifting regulation activities of upstream hairpin are conserved between 70S and 80S ribosomes. Unexpectedly, a downstream pseudoknot also possessed two opposing hungry codon-mediated frameshifting regulation activities: attenuation of +1 frameshifting and stimulation of a non-canonical −1 frameshifting within the +1 frameshift-prone CUUUGA frameshifting site in the absence of release factor 2 (RF2) in vitro. However, the −1 frameshifting activity of the downstream pseudoknot is not coupled with its +1 frameshifting attenuation ability. Similarly, the +1 frameshifting activity of the upstream hairpin is not required for its −1 frameshifting attenuation function Thus, each of the mRNA duplexes flanking the two ends of a ribosomal mRNA-binding channel possesses two functions in bi-directional ribosomal frameshifting regulation: frameshifting stimulation and counteracting the frameshifting activity of each other.
950bba54af319cd616816b5b79dc05c27c6d0be1	In order to work and travel safely during the outbreak of COVID-19, a method of security detection based on deep learning is proposed by using machine vision instead of manual monitoring. To detect the illegal behaviors of workers without masks in workplaces and densely populated areas, an improved convolutional neural network VGG-19 algorithm is proposed under the framework of tensorflow, and more than 3000 images are collected for model training and testing. Using VGG-19 network model, three FC layers are optimized into one flat layer and two FC layers with reduced parameters. The softmax classification layer of the original model is replaced by a 2-label softmax classifier. The experimental results show that the precision of the model is 97.62% and the recall is 96.31%. The precision of identifying the workers without masks is 96.82%, the recall is 94.07%, and the data set provided has a high precision.

We show that in the majority of patients, extensive virus PCR panels performed in addition to routine microbiological investigations remain negative and summarize 25 patients with onset of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in utero or within the first 10 days of life, in none of which an associated bacterial or viral infection was reported.

43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	Background: Increased vascular permeability is a key feature in the pathophysiology of sepsis and the development of organ failure. Shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx is increasingly being recognized as an important pathophysiological mechanism but at present it is unclear if glypicans contribute to this response. We hypothesized that plasma levels of glypicans (GPC) are elevated in patients with sepsis. Methods: Plasma GPC 1-6 levels were measured by ELISA in 10 patients with sepsis and 10 healthy controls as an initial screening. Plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 were further measured in a cohort of 184 patients with a clinically confirmed infection. Patients were divided into groups of those who had sepsis and those who had an infection without organ failure. To determine whether plasma glypicans could predict the development of organ failure, patients were further subdivided to those who had organ failure at enrolment and those who developed it after enrollment. The association of plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 with organ failure and with various markers of inflammation, disease severity, and glycocalyx shedding was investigated. Results: In the pilot study, only GPC 1, 3, and 4 were detectable in the plasma of sepsis patients. In the larger cohort, GPC 1, 3, and 4 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with sepsis than in those with infection without organ failure. GPC 1, 3, and 4 were significantly positively correlated with plasma levels of the disease severity markers C-reactive protein, lactate, procalcitonin, and heparin binding protein, and with the marker of glycocalyx degradation syndecan 1. They were significantly negatively correlated with plasma levels of the glycocalyx-protective factors apolipoprotein M and sphingosine-1-phosphate. Conclusions: We show that GPC 1, 3, and 4 are elevated in plasma of patients with sepsis and correlate with markers of disease severity, systemic inflammation, and glycocalyx damage.
8b3a987c599ef93544357312c807fbdd5093d5ab	Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins 1, 2 and 3 (IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) have recently been identified as potent antiviral effectors that function to suppress the entry of a broad range of enveloped viruses and modulate cellular tropism independent of viral receptor expression. However, the antiviral effect and mechanisms of IFITMs in response to viral infections remain incompletely understood and characterized. In this work, we focused our investigation on the function of the extracellular IFITM3 protein. In cell models of DENV-2 infection, we found that IFITM3 contributed to both the baseline and interferon-induced inhibition of DENV entry. Most importantly, our

The success in these tasks typically hinges on finding a good representation. In this paper, we extend invariant risk minimization (IRM) by recasting the simultaneous optimality condition in terms of regret, finding instead a representation that enables the predictor to be optimal against an oracle with hindsight access on held-out environments. The change refocuses the principle on generalization and doesn't collapse even with strong predictors that can perfectly fit all the training data. Our regret minimization (RGM) approach can be further combined with adaptive domain perturbations to handle combinatorially defined environments. We evaluate our method on two real-world applications: molecule property prediction and protein homology detection and show that RGM significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques.

1ca7321158dbe79c32b808f85af8716df74f238f	Motivated by the critical need to identify new treatments for COVID-19, we present a genome-scale, systems-level computational approach to prioritize drug targets based on their potential to regulate hostvirus interactions or their downstream signaling targets. We adapt and specialize network label propagation methods to this end. We demonstrate that these techniques can predict human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors with high accuracy. The top-ranked proteins 1 arXiv:2006.01968v2 [q-bio.MN] 22 Jun 2020 that we identify are enriched in host biological processes that are potentially coopted by the virus. We present cases where our methodology generates promising insights such as the potential role of HSPA5 in viral entry. We highlight the connection between endoplasmic reticulum stress, HSPA5, and anti-clotting agents. We identify tubulin proteins involved in ciliary assembly that are targeted by anti-mitotic drugs. Drugs that we discuss are already undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy against COVID-19. Our prioritized list of human proteins and drug targets is available as a general resource for biological and clinical researchers who are repositioning existing and approved drugs or developing novel therapeutics as anti-COVID-19 agents. We took inspiration from the success of network propagation in diverse applications in systems biology (8). Our underlying hypothesis was that network propagation was a reasonable mechanism for predicting SARS-CoV-2 interactors. To test this hypothesis, we conducted the following validation. For each interactor of a SARS-CoV-2 protein (7), we computed the propagation score (also called "diffusion score" or "heat" in the literature) treating all the other interactors of SARS-CoV-2 as sources. To this end, we applied the Regularized Laplacian (RL) (9), a widely-used technique for semi-supervised learning ("Methods"). These scores were significantly larger than the scores of randomly-selected nodes (Figure 2(a) ; p-value of 2.

d14208a77004363b34b3cf0b7d08fd0d121e12a4	Interest in bat-borne diseases and parasites has grown in the past decade over concerns for human health. However, the drivers of parasite diversity among bat host species are understudied as are the links between parasite richness and emerging risks. Thus, we aimed at exploring factors that explain macro and microparasite species richness in bats from Southeast Asia, a hotspot of emerging infectious diseases. First, we identified bat species that need increased sampling effort for pathogen discovery. Our approach highlights pathogen investigation disparities among species within the same genus, such as Rhinolophus and Pteropus. Secondly, comparative analysis using independent contrasts method allowed the identification of likely factors explaining parasite and viral diversity of bats. Our results showed a key role of bat distribution shape, an index of the fragmentation of bat distribution, on parasite diversity, linked to a decrease for both viral and endoparasite species richness. We discuss how our study may contribute to a better understanding of the link between parasite species richness and emergence.
44667424e0cb9bde15fdbd187136b37bdaae6435	Several bacteria and viruses remodel cellular membranes to form compartments specialised for replication. Bacteria replicate within inclusions which recruit membrane vesicles from the secretory pathway to provide nutrients for microbial growth and division. Viruses generate densely packed membrane vesicles called viroplasm which provide a platform to recruit host and viral proteins necessary for replication. This review describes examples where both intracellular bacteria (Salmonella, Chlamydia and Legionella) and viruses (picornaviruses and hepatitis C) recruit membrane vesicles to sites of replication by modulating proteins that control the secretory pathway. In many cases this involves modulation of Rab and Arf GTPases.

Many elective and nonessential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease as well as to conserve resources. Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature. Methods: Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures. Results: Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic, in outpatient and perioperative settings. Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol generating procedures such as surgery in the head and neck area. Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic, however definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases. Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semiurgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature. Conclusion: The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel and utilization of resources. Recommendations in this manuscript should be taken in the context of each institute's resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region. It should be emphasized that the guidelines provided are a snapshot of current practices and are subject to change as the pandemic continues to evolve. Plastic surgery practice during the pandemic is curtailed to urgent and emergent care, in an effort to reduce risk of disease transmission and to prevent shortage of valuable resources. As the outbreak gradually resolves, the scope of practice will broaden accordingly. The recommendations that are summarized in this article are a snapshot of current practices which are subject to change, however they also provide a valuable resource on how to practice under unusual circumstances that we may encounter in the future. Finally, all suggestions should be taken in the context of each institute's resources and prevalance of disease in the region.
e77157efd5d13bd2ed78788e151f191d5086ce37	Rapid diagnosis of adenoviral respiratory infections is required in order to decide optimal treatment strategies. The adenovirus antigen immunochromatography Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest (Leti diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain), was evaluated versus the shell-vial culture and multiplex PCR (Clart Pneumovir Version 3.0, Genomica, Madrid, Spain), in nasopharyngeal washes and oropharyngeal swabs specimens from subjects with respiratory tract infections. Between April 2011 and November 2012, 224 patients were included. The IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest was positive for 77.9% (74 of 95) of patients diagnosed at bedside. Using multiplex-PCR as the reference standard, the overall sensitivity was 77.9% and the specificity was 73.6%. Taking shell-viral culture as the reference method, the Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest (Leti diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain) sensitivity and specificity values were 80.0% and 60.9%, respectively. Using RT-PCR (Clart Pneumovir Version 3.0, Genomica, Madrid, Spain) as the reference standard, the viral culture sensitivity was 53.2% and the specificity was 100%. The Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest (Leti diagnostics, Barcelona, Spain) assay could be a simple and rapid method for antigenic detection of adenovirus in pediatric respiratory samples although it would be necessary to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the test.
590dc551804c7579ac9623ee64f81d1186261faa	During the intracellular life of Salmonella enterica, a unique membrane-bound compartment termed Salmonella-containing vacuole, or SCV, is formed. By means of translocated effector proteins, intracellular Salmonella also induce the formation of extensive, highly dynamic membrane tubules termed Salmonella-induced filaments or SIF. Here we report the first detailed ultrastructural analyses of the SCV and SIF by electron microscopy (EM), EM tomography and live cell correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). We found that a subset of SIF is composed of double membranes that enclose portions of host cell cytosol and cytoskeletal filaments within its inner lumen. Despite some morphological similarities, we found that the formation of SIF double membranes is independent from autophagy and requires the function of the effector proteins SseF and SseG. The lumen of SIF network is accessible to various types of endocytosed material and our CLEM analysis of double membrane SIF demonstrated that fluid phase markers accumulate only between the inner and outer membrane of these structures, a space continual with endosomal lumen. Our work reveals how manipulation of the endosomal membrane system by an intracellular pathogen results in a unique tubular membrane compartmentalization of the host cell, generating a shielded niche permissive for intracellular proliferation of Salmonella. Figure 2. Double membrane SIT contain cytoskeletal filaments and ribosomes. HeLa cells were infected with S. enterica WT as for Figure 1. A), B), C) and D) show examples of double-membrane SIT with microtubules, indicated by dark blue arrowheads. Orange and yellow arrowheads indicate inner and outer membranes of SIT, respectively.

4592eda086b8766299e217d6ccdc4676a16c3ffa	Predicting an accurate expected number of future COVID-19 cases is essential to properly evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment or preventive measure. This study aimed to identify the most appropriate mathematical model to prospectively predict the expected number of cases without any intervention. The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in 28 countries was analyzed and fitted to several simple rate models including the logistic, Gompertz, quadratic, simple square, and simple exponential growth models. The resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate predictions for more recent data. Results: While the Gompertz growth models (mean R 2 = 0.998) best fitted the current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions with logistic models prone to errors. Of the other models, the quadratic rate model (mean R 2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %) countries as determined by R 2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately predicted the number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance respectively, compared to only 15 days for the simple exponential model. The simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not. These results demonstrated that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given country can be made significantly in advance without the need for complicated models of population behavior and generate a reliable assessment of the efficacy of current prescriptive measures against disease spread.

After binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins or collectin 11 to carbohydrates or acetylated residues on pathogen surfaces, dimers of MBL-associated serine proteases 1 and 2 (MASP-1 and MASP-2) activate a proteolytic cascade, which culminates in the formation of the membrane attack complex and pathogen lysis. Alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding MASP-1 results in two other products, MASP-3 and MAp44, which regulate activation of the cascade. A similar mechanism allows the gene encoding MASP-2 to produce the truncated MAp19 protein. Polymorphisms in MASP1 and MASP2 genes are associated with protein serum levels and functional activity. Since the first report of a MASP deficiency in 2003, deficiencies in lectin pathway proteins have been associated with recurrent infections and several polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility or protection to infectious diseases. In this review, we summarize the findings on the role of MASP polymorphisms and serum levels in bacterial, viral and protozoan infectious diseases.

72d62e99b1135b7bd57791508bba7ea6cad4ae2c	Network Slicing (NS) is an evolving area of research, performing a logical arrangement of resources to operate as individual networks, hence allowing for massively customizable service and tenant requirements. NS, via the respective network architecture can enable an effective deployment of 5G networks and support a great variety of emerging use cases and/or related services. In this scope and with the aim of extending all potential network and service benefits, the concept of dynamic NS becomes a prominent feature of 5G allowing for connectivity and data processing tailored to specific customers' requirements. We discuss several essential features and fundamental designing principles that can affect the realization of a reliable dynamic NS, capable of serving an immense multiplicity of 5G-based innovations, towards structuring a fully mobile and inclusive society. Furthermore, due to its context, dynamic NS can support digital transformation and mobilization of industry vertical customers, implicating for significant commercial potential. To this aim, we also discuss related perspectives for market growth coming from proposed business models, together with regulatory concerns that could affect future growth of dynamic NS.
2f314a77ea26734587af46d6ed32345b0160760e	Objective: Although alveolar macrophages play a key role in the respiratory immunity of livestock, studies on the mechanism of differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages are lacking. Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment. Methods: 3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Dudleya brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with oil red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h. The ROS production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. The PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes. Conclusion: This study provides new insights and directions for further research relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.
3c6064a5527ae67861090d6d2c6b074cb37382b2	A. Why was this study conducted? 47 Pregnant women and newborns are exposed to COVID-19 and at risk for adverse 48 outcomes. The review of evidence is essential to guide preventive action and therapy. 49 B. What are the key findings? 50 Fetal distress and preterm delivery seem to be more frequent among women. Also, evidence on vertical transmission is emerging but the clinical relevance of 52 the fetal infection remains unclear. No evidence links the SARS-CoV-2 virus to 53 transmission via breast milk. 54 C. What does this study add to what is already known? 55 The comprehensive review of 212 pregnant women with COVID-19, summarizes the 56 evidence on vertical transmission, as well as adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. 57 Additionally, it adds the characteristics of the first eight cases of COVID-19 positive 58 women delivered in Portugal. Abstract Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential 62 adverse effects during pregnancy. This study reviews knowledge on the impact of 63 COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant 64 women diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as the characteristics of COVID-19 positive 65 women who delivered in Portugal by 31 of March 2020. 66 Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed® up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA 67 standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any 68 gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the 69 search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. 70 Portuguese cases were ascertained by contact with all Portuguese maternities and based 71 on the information provided by their health professionals. 72 Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with 73 COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. 74 The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women 75 with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of 76 maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 77 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, 78 placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four 79 newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM 80 antibodies. None of the first eight infants born in Portugal tested positive. Breast milk 81 samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-82 CoV-2. : medRxiv preprint 5 Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still 84 limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable 85 populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies. 86 87 Keywords: 88 361 The authors are grateful to the health professionals who provided and confirmed the cases 362 of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in Portugal:
76084d8a83f9bb96d6c340245baba445fd35fa79	This article critically studies coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic news in the press.
1be982943da2a4560172e3bbaf6e729c998113e5	COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. Immune dysregulation has been implicated, but immune responses remain poorly understood. We analyzed 71 COVID-19 patients compared to recovered and healthy subjects using high dimensional cytometry. Integrated analysis of ~200 immune and >30 clinical features revealed activation of T cell and B cell subsets, but only in some patients. A subgroup of patients had T cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection and plasmablast responses could reach >30% of circulating B cells. However, another subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable to uninfected subjects. Stable versus dynamic immunological signatures were identified and linked to trajectories of disease severity change. These analyses identified three "immunotypes" associated with poor clinical trajectories versus improving health. These immunotypes may have implications for therapeutics and vaccines.
ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933	Building on a series of ground breaking reviews that first defined and drew attention to emerging infectious diseases (EID), the 'convergence model' was proposed to explain the multifactorial causality of disease emergence. The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model's predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.
b0aac5df054c02ec2cda12e95db6e3537ad745fc	Within the context that Greece promises a success story in the fight against the disease, this paper proposes a novel method to study the evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve in relation to the anti-COVID-19 policies applied to control the pandemic. Based on the ongoing spreading of COVID-19 and the insufficient data for applying classic time-series approaches, the analysis builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve as a complex network. By using the modularity optimization algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods reveal a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes, implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better forecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices and management that may help other countries improve their performance in the war against COVID-19.
2db28d2cd54bf5a567c433e55b4b7071707707d1	Heterogeneity of interindividual and intraindividual responses to interventions is often observed in randomized, controlled trials for obesity. To address the global epidemic of obesity and move toward more personalized treatment regimens, the global research community must come together to identify factors that may drive these heterogeneous responses to interventions. This project, called OBEDIS (OBEsity Diverse Interventions Sharing -focusing on dietary and other interventions), provides a set of European guidelines for a minimal set of variables to include in future clinical trials on obesity, regardless of the specific endpoints. Broad adoption of these guidelines will enable researchers to harmonize and merge data from multiple intervention studies, allowing stratification of patients according to precise phenotyping criteria which are measured using standardized methods. In this way, studies across Europe may be pooled for better prediction of individuals' responses to an intervention for obesity -ultimately leading to better patient care and improved obesity outcomes.

5bfc04675064804f8ee4255ee8c115ad88319c4f	We report our initial experience with the management of a mixed group of patients with COVID-19 infection, admitted and treated in a designated COVID-19 centre in the Athens Metropolitan area over a 4-week period. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented a huge challenge to the Greek National Healthcare System and healthcare workers. Their response so far has been miraculously effective. Since there are essentially no therapeutic guidelines yet for this disease, we relied mainly on our medical intuition, our empathy for our patients and team work to do the best possible for 49 people with this infection. We present the therapeutic algorithm we gradually developed (on the job) and applied in our patients, based on continuous creative brainstorming and monitoring of the literature.
03aa0556aa6d712feb40fd557a3c0fd98338beda	A prospective cohort study was undertaken to determine calf-level factors that affected calf health status between birth and 6 months of age. A convenience sample of approximately 3300 female Holstein calves born in 1991 on two large Florida dairy farms was used for the study. Data collected on each calf at birth included farm of origin, weight, height at the pelvis, birth date, and serum total protein (a measure of colostral immunoglobulin absorption). Birth season was dichotomized into summer and winter using meteorological data collected by University of Florida Agricultural Research Stations. Health data including date of initial treatment and number of treatments were collected for the diseases diarrhea, omphalitis, septicemia and pneumonia. All calves were followed for 6 months. Cumulative incidences of mortality and occurrence of diarrhea, omphalitis, septicemia and pneumonia were 0.12, 0.35, 0.11, 0.24 and 0.21, respectively. Serum total protein (TP) was a significant risk factor for mortality. The association of TP and mortality was quadratic and showed a dramatic decrease in mortality as TP increased from 4.0 to 5.0 g/dl, a small improvement from 5.0 to 6.0 g/d1 and virtually no improvement in mortality rates as TP increased over 6.0 g/dl. The hazard mortality ratio was constant from birth to six months, indicating that the increased risk of mortality associated with low levels of TP was evident through six months of age. No interactions between TP, farm, season, or birth weight were found in these analyses. Serum total protein concentration was a significant risk factor for the 32 G. A. Donovan et al. /Preventive Veterinary Medicine 34 (1998) 31-46 occurrences, age of onset and severity of septicemia and pneumonia. The association between TP and septicemia was linear and an interaction with birth season was found. The association between TP and pneumonia was quadratic, and in contrast to the TP-and-septicemia relationship, the morbidity hazard ratio for pneumonia was not constant over the time measured; that is, colostral immunity protected the calf from developing pneumonia early in life, but this effect disappeared as the calf got older. Total protein was not a significant risk factor for diarrhea or omphalitis. 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.
aa5b3284c6aa3151c2165660f2f9479ac8d0c94f	Since the first known case of a COVID-19 infected patient in Wuhan, China on 8 December 2019, COVID-19 has spread to more than 200 countries, causing a worldwide public health crisis. The existing literature fails to examine what caused this sudden outbreak from a crisis management perspective. This article attempts to fill this research gap through analysis of big data, officially released information and other social media sources to understand the root cause of the crisis as it relates to China's current management system and public health policy. The article draws the following conclusions: firstly, strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements, which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of COVID-19. Secondly, a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature, and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time, lead to falsehood and concealment. Thirdly, the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis. Finally, the privatization of many state-owned hospitals led to the unavailability of public health medical resources to serve affected patients in the Wuhan and Hubei Province. This article suggests that China should adopt a Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time. In addition, the central government should adopt the territorial administration model of a public health crisis and increase investment in public health in China.
9817181e3f1c7e2f11e4efc1e7add7a9b35653cf	Background: Scrub typhus can present with atypical signs and symptoms such as those of acute kidney injury, gastroenteritis, pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatic dysfunction have also been reported, particularly in severe cases with multisystem involvement. Scrub typhus has never been reported in the literature to cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) which includes cystitis and pyelonephritis. Case presentation: A 45-year old male presenting to the outpatient unit with fever, right flank pain, and burning micturition for three days was initially treated for UTI. However, he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms. He was hospitalized, with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. Computerized tomography scan of his abdomen-pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis, so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin. Despite this, the patient's condition deteriorated. Laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement: decreasing platelets, raised creatinine, and deranged liver panel. As Kathmandu was hit by dengue epidemic during the patient's hospitalization, on the seventh day of his illness, blood samples were sent for tropical fever investigation. All tests came out negative except for scrub typhus-IgM antibodies positive on rapid diagnostic test. The patient's symptoms subsided after 48 h of starting doxycycline and he became fully asymptomatic four days later. Fever did not recur even after discontinuing other IV antibiotics, favoring scrub typhus disease rather than systemic bacterial sepsis. Conclusions: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease of Nepal. Therefore, every unexplained fever cases (irrespective of clinical presentation) should be evaluated for potential Rickettsiosis. Moreover, for cases with acute pyelonephritis, atypical causative agents should be investigated, for example scrub typhus in this case.
f9e5aa2b859fcbc0c3c8aa7ffd8eb964bc002406	Prenatal COVID infection is one of the worst affected and least attended aspects of the COVID-19 disease. Like other coronaviruses, CoV2 infection is anticipated to affect fetal development by maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Studies showed that higher prenatal choline level in mother's body can safeguard the developing brain of the fetus from the adverse effects of CoV2 infection. Choline is commonly used as food supplement. By virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics techniques, we have established a strong inhibitory possibility of choline for SARS 3CL pro protease which may provide a lead for prenatal COVID-19 treatment.

ee37e006cb0198e82db141fecb0b7fe985a59acc	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global 13 pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated 14 with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and 15 mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 16 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this 17 pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular 18 underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and 19 clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in 20 the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-21 19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with 22 influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived 23 coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential 24 lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. 25 26 27 GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT 28 29 AUTHOR SUMMARY 30 31 Why was this study done? 32 • Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global 33 pandemic. 34 • In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-35 CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in 36 many patients. 37 • Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are 38 unknown. Understanding the molecular basis of dysregulated blood coagulation during SARS-39 CoV-2 infection may help promote new therapeutic strategies to mitigate these complications in 40 COVID-19 patients. 41 42 What did the researchers do and find? 43 • We analyzed three publicly available RNA sequencing datasets to identify possible molecular 44 etiologies of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies. These data sets include sequencing libraries 45 from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood 46 mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy controls. We also 47 analyzed a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset derived from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 48 infected primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and mock infected samples. • Pathway analysis of both NHBE and BALF differential gene expression gene sets. We found that 50 SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and 51 suppression of the plasminogen activation system in both NHBEs and cells isolated from the 52 BALF. PBMCs did not differentially express genes regulating blood coagulation. • Comparison with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs revealed that the regulation of the 54 extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is unique to SARS-CoV-2, and not seen with IAV infection. What do these findings mean? • The hyper-activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and the suppression of the 58 plasminogen activation system in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells may drive diverse 59 coagulopathies in the lung and distal organ systems.
6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45	Hundred viruses can be isolated in patients suffering from respiratory virus infections and hospitalised in intensive care unit (ICU): influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus… Nasal or tracheobronchial specimens, which contain many epithelial cells will be used to isolate these common viruses. In immunocompromised patients a bronchoalveolar lavage has to be added to these specimens in order to detect cytomegalovirus and some adenovirus. The immunofluorescence or immunoenzymatic assays, which detect viral antigens in the infected cells are the easiest and fastest diagnostic methods, theoretically. As with other techniques, specimen quality is a major determinant of their performance. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the antigen detection assays is low in respiratory infections in adults. Then the virus recovery by cell culture, which is usually more sensitive than the antigen detection assays, can be helpful. Many studies have reported more respiratory virus detections using nucleic acid testing such as PCR. They detect viruses, which are missed by conventional methods and increase the detection of common respiratory virus. Multiplex PCR assays have been developed, and these can simultaneously detect several viruses directly in clinical specimens. Nucleic acid testing can subtype viruses using subtype-specific primers, and analyse strain variation through genetic. It can be used also to quantify the viral load in clinical specimens. More recently real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed to get more rapidly the results of the nucleic acids assays. Specimen quality, timing and transportation conditions may be less critical for nucleic acid testing than for culture or antigen detection, as viable virus and intact infected cells need not to be preserved. Moreover, viral nucleic acids are detectable for several days longer into the clinical course than is cultivable virus, potentially allowing a diagnosis to be made in late-presenting patients. However, in a clinical virology laboratory, where the speed, low cost, and high sensitivity of the methods are required, the sequential use of antigen detection tests and multiplex PCR could be the best choice, particularly in the clinical setting of respiratory virus infections in adults hospitalised in ICU. In the future, the development of real-time multiplex PCR is likely to be top-priority. © 2007 Société de réanimation de langue française. Publié par Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits réservés.
b7e2f58e4ab6b73c6a574dfec28d20396e16ed3c	The extent to which people implement government-issued protective measures is critical in preventing further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to describe the public belief in the effectiveness of protective measures, the reported implementation of these measures, and to identify communication channels used to acquire information on COVID-19 in European countries during the early stage of the pandemic. An online survey available in multiple languages was disseminated starting on March 19th, 2020. After five days, we computed descriptive statistics for countries with more than 500 respondents. Each day, we assessed enacted community containment measures by stage of stringency (I-IV). In total, 9,796 adults responded, of whom 8,611 resided in the Netherlands (stage III), 604 in Germany (stage III), and 581 in Italy (stage IV). To explore possible dynamics as containment strategies intensified, we also included 1,365 responses submitted during the following week. Participants indicated support for governmental measures related to avoiding social gatherings, selective closure of public places, and hand hygiene and respiratory measures (range for all measures: 95.0%-99.7%). Respondents from the Netherlands less frequently considered a complete social lockdown effective (59.2%), compared to respondents in Germany (76.6%) or Italy (87.2%). Italian residents applied enforced social distancing measures more frequently (range: 90.2%-99.3%, German and Dutch residents: 67.5%-97.0%) and self-initiated hygienic and social distancing behaviors (range: 36.3%-96.6%, German and Dutch residents: 28.3%-95.7%). Respondents reported being sufficiently informed about the outbreak and behaviors to avoid infection (range: PLOS ONE | https://doi.

However, the benefit and cost-effectiveness vary in each country or community because they have different standard practices and health care systems. In Japan, rapid antigen tests (RATs) have been frequently used for pediatric respiratory infections. We investigated the impact and cost-effectiveness of a multiplex PCR (mPCR) respiratory panel for pediatric respiratory infections in a Japanese community hospital. Methods: We replaced RATs with an mPCR respiratory panel (FilmArray®) for admitted pediatric respiratory infections on March 26, 2018. We compared the days of antimicrobial therapy (DOT) and length of stay (LOS) during the mPCR period (Results: During the RAT and mPCR periods, 1132 and 149 patients were analyzed. The DOT/case was 12.82 vs 8.56 (p < 0.001), and the LOS was 8.18 vs 6.83 days (p ¼ 0.032) in the RAT and mPCR groups, respectively. The total costs during admissions were \258,824 ($2331.7) and \243,841 ($2196.8)/case, respectively. Pathogen detection rates were 30.2% vs 87.2% (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Compared to conventional RATs, the mPCR test contributed to a reduction in the DOT and LOS in a Japanese community hospital for admission-requiring pediatric respiratory infections. However, a proper stewardship program is essential to further reduce the unnecessary usage of antimicrobials.
d2e314ff89c2a578ca7f69bb450d3ac019708144	Health care services are being confronted by a daily dilemma of who can receive critical care and who cannot. In a palliative care clinic, this apprehension gets exemplified, as these patients have limited life expectancy. The head and neck region further makes things critical, as it comprises of all the sites through which the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted. This document strives to define the ways in which the head and neck cancer services can contribute to better patient care in a triage context. Practical steps suggested are protective equipment use, ensuring access to critical drugs (such as opioids), greater use of telemedicine consultations, discussing advance care plans, and embracing the role of a wider community support.
0f45da571ca739a0ec5c818fa2d39025398673d7	Seoul virus (SEOV) is a zoonotic orthohantavirus carried by black and brown rats, and can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. Human cases of SEOV virus infection have most recently been reported in the USA, United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands and were primarily associated with contact with pet rats and feeder rats. Infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection. Little is known about the cell tropism of SEOV in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature. Here we report the histopathological analysis of SEOV cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats, comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles. All adult rats in this study were positive for SEOV specific antibodies and viral RNA in their tissues. One juvenile rat was seropositive, but negative in the rRT-PCR. Of the 19 adult rats of which subsequently additional organs were tested, SEOV RNA was detected in all lungs, followed by kidney (79%) and liver (74%). Histopathologic changes associated with SEOV infection were primarily found in the liver, consistent with a pathological diagnosis of a mild hepatitis. In conclusion, natural SEOV infection results in mild inflammation of the liver in the absence of clinical disease.
446af0477a14ed2d00d741101e3866c5c30f9406	The outbreak of COVID19 has been declared a global pandemic by WHO which started in Wuhan last November and now has spread to more than 200 countries with 4.5 million cases and a death toll of more than 300 thousand. In response, many countries have implemented lock down to ensure social distancing and started rigorously quarantining the infected subjects. Here we utilized the infection dynamics available from WHO and quantitatively calibrated the confirmed, recovered, and dead populations from 23 different countries. The chosen countries chosen are in three stages of infection 1. Where the first wave of infection is significantly diminished 2. Infection peak is reached but daily infection still persists significantly 3. The infection peak is not yet reached. The model successfully captured the daily trajectories of countries with both early and late phase of infection and determined incubation time, transmission rate, quarantine and recovery rates. Our analysis shows, the reduction in the estimated reproduction number with time is significantly correlated to the testing rate and medical facility of a country. Further, our model identifies that an increase in quarantine rate through more testing could be the most potent strategy to substantially reduce the undetected infection, accelerate the time to infection peak and facilitate faster recovery of a nation from the first infection wave, which could perhaps have direct social and economic implications. Our model also shows, that post lockdown infection spread towards a much larger second wave can be controlled via rigorous increase in the quarantine rates which could be tailored in a country specific manner; for instance, our simulations suggest that USA or Spain would require a 10 fold more increase in quarantine rates compared to India to control the second wave post lockdown. Our data driven modeling and analysis of the trajectories from multiple countries thus pave a way to understand the infection dynamics during and post lockdown phases in various countries and it can help strategize the testing and quarantine processes and influence the spread of the disease in future.
cef038f20123d3ce78a8c6d70e79ffa01aff1e0b	The virus particles described in previous chapters are vehicles that transmit the viral genome and the infection from cell to cell. To initiate the infective cycle, the viral genome must therefore translocate from the viral particle to the cytoplasm. Via distinct proteins or motifs in their outermost shell, the particles attach initially to specific molecules on the host cell surface. These virus receptors thus mediate penetration of the viral genome inside the cell, where the intracellular infective cycle starts. The presence of these receptors on the cell surface is a principal determinant of virus host tropism. Viruses can use diverse types of molecules to attach to and enter into cells. In addition, virus-receptor recognition can evolve over the course of an infection, and virus variants with distinct receptorbinding specificities and tropism can appear. The identification of virus receptors and the characterization of virus-receptor interactions have been major research goals in virology for the last two decades. In this chapter, we will describe, from a structural perspective, several virus-receptor interactions and the active role of receptor molecules in virus entry.
b94ed97de06abc45de3ecc4e688c9ed357920162	The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerged infection in humans affecting the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, and North Africa. The source and persistence of the infection in humans remains unknown. The aim of this paper was to apply a risk analysis approach to the epidemiology of MERS-CoV and to understand the source of ongoing infections. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV was reviewed and compared to SARS. Each observed feature of MERS-CoV epidemiology was summarized and fitted to either an epidemic or one of two sporadic scenarios (either animal or deliberate release). As of May 2014, MERS-CoV has infected over 681 people and killed a further 204 over 2 years. In contrast, there were 8,273 cases and 775 deaths from SARS within 8 months. MERS-CoV has a more sporadic pattern unlike the clear epidemic pattern seen with SARS, and an unusual concentration of cases in the Middle East, without epidemics in other countries to which it has spread. SARS, with a higher reproductive number (R0), was eliminated from humans within 8 months of emerging, yet MERS-CoV, with a low R0 has persisted in humans over a far more prolonged period. This is at odds with the expected behavior of a virus with a low R0, which theoretically should not persist unless there are ongoing introductions of infection into humans, and poses the question ''what is the source of continuing infections in humans?'' A hospital outbreak in Al Ahsa, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), had a classic epidemic pattern with some humanto-human transmission. However, 3 different strains were

ff59b843f749e5472741aeb4d0165abeb371b73e	Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019, more than 2,500,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 as of April 22. In response to this epidemic, China has issued seven trial versions of diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19. According to the information that we have collected so far, this article provides an overview of potential therapeutic drugs and compounds with much attention, including favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine, as well as traditional Chinese medicine, which have been reported with good clinical treatment effects. Moreover, with further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus, new drugs targeting specific SARS-CoV-2 viral components arise and investigations on these novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents are also reviewed.
e2083005201450b84a2820f34e85afb508f497e6	The SARS-Cov2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor for cell entry. It has been suggested that ACEinhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin-2 Blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise tissue ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID19 infection. We evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68±17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity. 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21-days of symptom onset. 399 patients (33.3 %) were taking ACEi or ARB. Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, was 0.63 (CI 0.47-0.84, p<0.01). There was no evidence for increased severity of COVID19 disease in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB. A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta-analyses and randomised clinical trials.
7e6c74ffdbd859bb855347418beea3d1449930dd	Worldwide, as of July 2020, >13.2 million people have been infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from mild illness to critical illness in 5% of cases. The population infected with SARS-CoV-2 requiring an intensive care unit admission often requires nutrition therapy as part of supportive care. Although the various societal guidelines for critical care nutrition meet most needs for the patient with COVID-19, numerous factors, which impact the application of those guideline recommendations, need to be considered. Since the SARSCoV-2 virus is highly contagious, several key principles should be considered when caring for all patients with COVID-19 to ensure the safety of all healthcare personnel involved. Management strategies should cluster care, making all attempts to bundle patient care to limit exposure. Healthcare providers should be protected, and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 should be limited by minimizing procedures and other interventions that lead to aerosolization, avoiding droplet exposure through hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE should be preserved by decreasing the number of individuals providing direct patient care and by limiting the number of patient interactions. Enteral nutrition (EN) is tolerated by the majority of patients with COVID-19, but a relatively low threshold for conversion to parenteral nutrition should be maintained if increased exposure to the virus is required to continue EN. This article offers relevant and practical recommendations on how to optimize nutrition therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19. (Nutr Clin Pract. 2020;0:1-8) 
b066519705fe9fe8e8d8e00558e0ba357b87c019	The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in December 2019 and then spread throughout the world rapidly. The virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and modulates the expression of ACE2 in host cells. ACE2, a pivotal component of the renin-angiotensin system, exerts its physiological functions by modulating the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7). We reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ACE2 in the female reproductive system, hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-nCoV to female fertility. The available evidence suggests that ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta. Therefore, we believe that apart from droplets and contact transmission, the possibility of mother-to-child and sexual transmission also exists. Ang II, ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) regulate follicle development and ovulation, modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development. Taking these functions into account, 2019-nCoV may disturb the female reproductive functions through regulating ACE2.
a5b52c5ad7be21e6896955d2a98b6fb99c963412	Epizootic pathogens pose a major threat to many wildlife species, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environments. Pangolins (order Pholidota) are highly threatened mammals, in large part due to the trade in illegal wildlife. During July to August 2018 four sick wild pangolins (three Manis javanica and one Manis pentadactyla) exhibiting a variety of clinical symptoms were rescued by the Jinhua Wildlife Protection Station in Zhejiang province, China. Although three of these animals died, fortunately one recovered after 2 weeks of symptomatic treatment. Using meta-transcriptomics combined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we identified two novel RNA viruses in two of the dead pangolins. Genomic analysis revealed that these viruses were most closely related to pestiviruses and coltiviruses, although still highly genetically distinct, with more than 48 and 25 per cent sequence divergence at the amino acid level, respectively. We named these Dongyang pangolin virus (DYPV) and Lishui pangolin virus (LSPV) based on the sampling site and hosts. Although coltiviruses (LSPV) are known to be transmitted by ticks, we found no evidence of LSPV in ticks sampled close to where the pangolins were collected. In addition, although DYPV was present in nymph ticks (Amblyomma javanense) collected from a diseased pangolin, they were not found in the local tick population. Epidemiological investigation revealed that both novel viruses might have been imported following the illegal international trade of pangolins. Hence, these data indicate that illegal wildlife trafficking not only threatens the status of pangolin populations, but may also spread epizootic pathogens.
6e95a69f48c5d841906b055e7476574665004f9a	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus infectious disease has become a pandemic. Social (physical) distancing is a key non-pharmacologic control measure to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2, but high-level adherence is needed. Using daily travel distance and stay-at-home time derived from large-scale anonymous mobile phone location data provided by Descartes Labs and SafeGraph, we quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates have been followed in the U.S. and its effect on growth of COVID-19 cases. The correlation between the COVID-19 growth rate and travel distance decay rate and dwell time at home change rate was -0.586 (95% CI: -0.742∼-0.370) and 0.526 (95% CI: 0.293∼0.700), 1 arXiv:2004.11430v1 [cs.SI] 23 Apr 2020 respectively. Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.04∼6.86 days to 3.66∼30.29 days after social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with mechanistic epidemic prediction models. Social distancing mandates reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are followed.
f83950a0ebd06ef4f1da62f1785651ad83188ea9	A recombinant baculovirus containing a cDNA which encodes haemagglutininneuraminidase (HN) of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was constructed. Spodqteru frugiperda cells infected with this recombinant virus produced a large amount of HN glycoprotein similar to the authentic HN in size. The recombinant HN glycoprotein was localized on the surface of the infected cells and conserved its haemadsorption and neuraminidase activities. The antigenic properties of the recombinant HN glycoprotein seemed to be slightly different from the authentic one, as judging by the reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to the antigenic sites responsible for neutralization of viral infectivity. Chickens inoculated with the cells infected with the recombinant virus developed haemagglutination-inhibition and virus neutralization antibodies, and were completely protected from the NDV challenge.

8aa983c0b271769d151b40c58bda6a3d3c0b47e8	Background-Extracellular cyclophilins (eCyPs) are pro-inflammatory factors implicated in pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases. Most pathogenic activities of eCyPs are related to their chemotactic activity towards leukocytes, which is mediated by eCyP receptor on target cells, CD147, and involves peptydil-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins. This activity is inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA) and non-immunosuppressive derivatives of this drug. Accumulating evidence for the role of eCyPs in disease pathogenesis stimulated research on the mechanisms of eCyP-initiated events, resulting in identification of multiple signaling pathways, characterization of a variety of effector molecules released from eCyP-treated cells, and synthesis of CsA derivatives specifically blocking eCyPs. However, a number of important questions related to the mode of action of eCyPs remain unanswered. Scope of review-In this article, we integrate available information on release and function of extracellular cyclophilins into a unified model, focusing on outstanding issues that need to be clarified. Major conclusions-Extracellular cyclophilins are critical players in pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases. Their mechanism of action involves interaction with the receptor, CD147, and initiation of a poorly characterized signal transduction process culminating in chemotaxis and production of pro-inflammatory factors. General significance-Extracellular cyclophilins present an attractive target for therapeutic interventions that can be used to alleviate symptoms and consequences of acute and chronic inflammation.
0259e5d030a8dd53a01e3c673f8aaf933cd890a7	The global shortage of reagents and kits for nucleic acid extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2, requires new cost-effective strategies for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially in countries that need to increase detection capacity. Pooled nucleic acid testing has been extensively used as a cost-effective strategy for HIV, HepB, HepC and influenza. Also, protocols dispensing of RNA extraction appears as an attractive option for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, pooling nasopharyngeal samples with both automated and manual extraction proved reliable, and thus a potential efficient alternative for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in developing countries.

23c3f5aab84c1bf1506a574ccf17d8cf9d1e681f	The COVID-19 crisis has created a "mental health pandemic" throughout the world. Scientific data are not available to fully understand the nature of the resulting mental health impact given the very recent onset of the pandemic, nevertheless, there is a need to act immediately to develop psychotherapeutic strategies that may alleviate pandemic-related distress. The psychological distress, in particular fear and sadness, is a function of the pandemic's negative impact upon people's ability to meet their most basic needs (e.g., physical safety, financial security, social connection, participation in meaningful activities). This paper presents evidence-based cognitive behavioral strategies that should prove useful in reducing the emotional suffering associated with the COVID crisis.
7a31934a646fe1bb3400d2718b13661b999cad56	Aviation alters the composition of the atmosphere globally and can thus drive climate change and ozone depletion. The last major international assessment of these impacts was made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999. Here, a comprehensive updated assessment of aviation is provided. Scientific advances since the 1999 assessment have reduced key uncertainties, sharpening the quantitative evaluation, yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The climate impact of aviation is driven by long-term impacts from CO 2 emissions and shorter-term impacts from non-CO 2 emissions and effects, which include the emissions of water vapour, particles and nitrogen oxides (NO x ). The presentday radiative forcing from aviation (2005) is estimated to be 55 mW m À2 (excluding cirrus cloud enhancement), which represents some 3.5% (range 1.3-10%, 90% likelihood range) of current anthropogenic forcing, or 78 mW m À2 including cirrus cloud enhancement, representing 4.9% of current forcing (range 2-14%, 90% likelihood range). According to two SRES-compatible scenarios, future forcings may increase by factors of 3-4 over 2000 levels, in 2050. The effects of aviation emissions of CO 2 on global mean surface temperature last for many hundreds of years (in common with other sources), whilst its non-CO 2 effects on temperature last for decades. Much progress has been made in the last ten years on characterizing emissions, although major uncertainties remain over the nature of particles. Emissions of NO x result in production of ozone, a climate warming gas, and the reduction of ambient methane (a cooling effect) although the overall balance is warming, based upon current understanding. These NO x emissions from current subsonic aviation do not appear to deplete stratospheric ozone. Despite the progress made on modelling aviation's impacts on tropospheric chemistry, there remains a significant spread in model results. The knowledge of aviation's impacts on cloudiness has also improved: a limited number of studies have demonstrated an increase in cirrus cloud attributable to aviation although the magnitude varies: however, these trend analyses may be impacted by satellite artefacts. The effect of aviation particles on clouds (with and without contrails) may give rise to either a positive forcing or a negative forcing: the modelling and the underlying processes are highly uncertain, although the overall effect of contrails and enhanced cloudiness is considered to be a positive forcing and could be substantial, compared with other effects. The debate over quantification of aviation impacts has also progressed towards studying potential mitigation and the technological and atmospheric tradeoffs. Current studies are still relatively immature and more work is required to determine optimal technological development paths, which is an aspect that atmospheric science has much to contribute. In terms of alternative fuels, liquid hydrogen represents a possibility and may reduce some of aviation's impacts on climate if the fuel is produced in a carbon-neutral way: such fuel is unlikely to be utilized until a 'hydrogen economy'
131af5ab50551638e3ce9a8c615b9b4364f2f34e	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic alphacoronavirus. In the United States, highly virulent PEDV strains cause between 80 and 100% mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and farms. To study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission, we developed a molecular clone of PEDV strain PC22A. The infectious-clone-derived PEDV (icPEDV) replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo. Importantly, recombinant PEDV was rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact, demonstrating virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the wild-type virus. Using reverse genetics, we removed open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene to generate icPEDV-⌬ORF3-RFP. icPEDV-⌬ORF3-RFP replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, was efficiently transmitted among pigs, and produced lethal disease outcomes. However, the diarrheic scores in icPEDV-⌬ORF3-RFP-infected pigs were lower than those in wild-type-virus-or icPEDV-infected pigs, and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of PC22A. Together, these data describe the development of a robust reverse-genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo, providing key infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting. States in 2013 and has since killed 10% of U.S. farm pigs. Though the disease has been circulating internationally for decades, the lack of a rapid reverse-genetics platform for manipulating PEDV and identifying genetic factors that impact transmission and virulence has hindered the study of this important agricultural disease. Here, we present a DNA-based infectious-clone system that replicates the pathogenesis of circulating U.S. strain PC22A both in vitro and in piglets. This infectious clone can be used both to study the genetics, virulence, and transmission of PEDV coronavirus and to inform the creation of a live attenuated PEDV vaccine. R. 2016.

Often they rely on only superficial rote learning, which might lead to medical errors. We have 30 developed a lesson plan that is based on this educational need using Gagné´s Instructional Design for the example of 31 teaching the complex preoperative management of diabetic patients. Our aim was to use Gagne's approach 32 successfully for the teaching of non-procedural skills. Methods: We implemented a comprehensive lesson plan that was developed on the example of a clinical pattern -34 the preoperative assessment of diabetic patients -using Gagné´s systematic nine-step model of instruction design. After the lesson, we analysed the trainees´ opinions with the use of a standardized questionnaire. 36 Results: Nine trainees with 2.1± 0.8 years of anesthesia experience attended the lesson. The assessment of 37 knowledge revealed in 82% the correct answers to the treatment options, and the residents' overall view on the 38 lecture concept were 4.8±0.3 for lecture concept and realization and 4.7±0.5 regarding motivation, participation and 39 climate. 40 Conclusions: Applying Gagné´s Instructional Design model guides seems to effectively guide the development of a 41 comprehensive lesson plan to teach non-procedural skills in a small group setting. 42 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 65 skills education [20, 22-24, 26, 27], although it is significantly less used for the teaching of knowledge as described 66 herein. 67 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 93 6) Elicit the performance: This step allowed the trainees to practice and train for the correct prescriptions.

00720d56a308d5afe9f85b97645abae3d324ae59	A total of ten infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates collected from commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 and N genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial S1 gene sequences showed that five field viruses clustered together with 793/B-type strains, having 91.3-98.5% nucleotide identity within the group, and one isolate had very close sequence relationship (94.6% identity) with 624/I strain. These two IBV types have been identified in Italy previously. The other three variant isolates formed novel genotype detected recently in many countries of Western Europe. For one of these variant viruses, Italy-02, which afterwards became the prototype strain, the entire S1 gene was sequenced to confirm its originality. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of more conserved partial N gene sequences, comprising 1-300 nucleotides, revealed different clustering. Thus, three variant IBVs of novel Italy-02 genotype, which had 96.7-99.2% S1 gene nucleotide identity with each other, belonged to three separate subgroups based on N gene sequences. 624/I-type isolate Italy-06 together with Italy-03, which was undetectable using S1 gene primers, shared 97.7% and 99.3% identity, respectively, in N gene region with vaccine strain H120. Only one of the 793/B-type isolates, Italy-10, clustered with the 793/B strain sharing 99.3% partial N gene identity, whereas the other four isolates were genetically distant from them (only 87.7-89.7% identity) and formed separate homogenous subgroup. The results demonstrated that both mutations and recombination events could contribute to the genetic diversity of the Italian isolates.
d29aff541cdafaf123b8c8ccae6689ab888affbb	Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the most critical pathogens in the poultry industry, causing serious economic losses in all countries including Iraq. IBV has many genotypes that do not confer any cross-protection. This virus has been genotyped by sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene. A total of 100 tracheal and kidney tissue specimens from different commercial broiler flocks in the middle and south of Iraq were collected from September 2013 to September 2014. Thirty-two IBV-positive samples were selected from among the total and were further characterized by nested PCR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates belong to four groups (group I, variant 2 [IS/1494-like]; group II, 793/B-like; group III, QX-like; group IV, DY12-2-like). Sequence analysis revealed nucleotide sequence identities within groups I, II, and III of 99.68 %-100 %, 99.36 %-100 %, and 96.42 %-100 %, respectively. Group I (variant 2) was the dominant IBV genotype. One Chinese-like recombinant virus (DY12-2-like) that had not been reported in the Middle East was detected. In addition, the presence of QX on broiler chicken farms in the area studied was confirmed. This is the first comprehensive study on the genotyping of IBV in Iraq with useful information regarding the molecular epidemiology of IBV. The phylogenetic relationship of the strains with respect to different time sequences and geographical regions displayed complexity and diversity. Further studies are needed and should include the isolation and full-length molecular characterization of IBV in this region.

In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of Vero E6 cells with interleukin-4 (IL-4) decreased the susceptibility of these cells to SARS-CoV infection. In contrast to IFNs, IL-4 did not show antiviral activity when administered immediately after SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that IL-4 acts early during the SARS-CoV replication cycle. Indeed, binding of recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein to Vero E6 cells was diminished on cells treated with IL-4, but also on cells exposed to IFN-γ. Consistent with these observations, IL-4 and IFN-γ downregulated cell surface expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV receptor. Besides diminished ACE2 cell surface expression, ACE2 mRNA levels were also decreased after treatment with these cytokines. These findings suggest that IL-4 and IFN-γ inhibit SARS-CoV replication partly through downregulation of ACE2.
048e376dcc509f4ec4ede433c22877b4c98fc4af	The genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae includes the Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) which were discovered in the 1990s in Australia and Malaysia, respectively, after emerging to cause severe and often fatal outbreaks in humans and animals. While HeV is confined to Australia, more recent NiV outbreaks have been reported in Bangladesh, India and the Philippines. The clinical manifestations of both henipaviruses in humans appear similar, with a predominance of an acute encephalitic syndrome. Likewise, the pathological features are similar and characterized by disseminated, multi-organ vasculopathy comprising endothelial infection/ulceration, vasculitis, vasculitis-induced thrombosis/occlusion, parenchymal ischemia/microinfarction, and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system (CNS), lung, kidney and other major organs. This unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis-induced microinfarction and neuronal infection causes severe tissue damage in the CNS. Both viruses can also cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection. Many animal models studied to date have largely confirmed the pathology of henipavirus infection, and provided the means to test new therapeutic agents and vaccines. As the bat is the natural host of henipaviruses and has worldwide distribution, spillover events into human populations are expected to occur in the future.

59fde3475d248b9d801bb8bff06dcfd90ef93510	By April 7th, 2020, the Coronavirus disease 2019 has infected one and a half million people worldwide, accounting for over 80 thousand of deaths in 209 countries and territories around the world. The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.
409e8fa9c8b69d7982ac0ecc28437a2e8a246d2a	The recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection in Korea resulted in large socioeconomic losses. This provoked the Korean government and the general public to recognize the importance of having a well-established system against infectious diseases. Although epidemiologic investigation is one of the most important aspects of prevention, it has been pointed out that much needs to be improved in Korea. We review here the current status of the Korean epidemiologic service and suggest possible supplementation measures. We examine the current national preventive infrastructure, including human resources such as Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, its governmental management, and related policies. In addition, we describe the practical application of these resources to the recent MERS outbreak and the progress in preventive measures. The spread of MERS demonstrated that the general readiness for emerging infectious diseases in Korea is considerably low. We believe that it is essential to increase society's investment in disease prevention. Fostering public health personnel, legislating management policies, and establishing research centers for emerging infectious diseases are potential solutions. Evaluating international preventive systems, developing cooperative measures, and initiating improvements are necessary. We evaluated the Korean epidemiologic investigation system and the public preventive measures against infectious diseases in light of the recent MERS outbreak. We suggest that governmental authorities in Korea enforce preventive policies, foster the development of highly qualified personnel, and increase investment in the public health domain of infectious disease prevention.
5a85cf34eee367f1a73ac62a05779d4c815dc767	Francisella tularensis is classified as a Tier 1 select agent by the CDC due to its low infectious dose and the possibility that the organism can be used as a bioweapon. The low dose of infection suggests that Francisella is unusually efficient at evading host defenses. Although~50 cfu are necessary to cause human respiratory infection, the early interactions of virulent Francisella with the lung environment are not well understood.

e0928044da01740e830bf59e2e9e47c0f61688e3	A major limitation of current humanized mouse models is that they primarily enable the analysis of human-specific pathogens that infect hematopoietic cells. However, most human pathogens target other cell types, including epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Here, we show that implantation of human lung tissue, which contains up to 40 cell types, including nonhematopoietic cells, into immunodeficient mice (lung-only mice) resulted in the development of a highly vascularized lung implant. We demonstrate that emerging and clinically relevant human pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Zika virus, respiratory syncytial virus and cytomegalovirus replicate in vivo in these lung implants. When incorporated into bone marrow/liver/thymus humanized mice, lung implants are repopulated with autologous human hematopoietic cells. We show robust antigen-specific humoral and T-cell responses following cytomegalovirus infection that control virus replication. Lung-only mice and bone marrow/liver/thymus-lung humanized mice substantially increase the number of human pathogens that can be studied in vivo, facilitating the in vivo testing of therapeutics.
67563629ac649af63af5557d5118846b0c46f36f	This study proposes a simulation model of a new type of infectious disease based on smallpox, Ebola haemorrhagic fever and a health policy Game. SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse infectious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, bioterrorism, to name a few. On the other hand, Agent-based model or Individual-based model begins to spread in recent years. The model enables to represent behaviour of each person in the computer. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on Epstein's model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff to infection control measures and so on. Furthermore, infectious simulation of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, which has not yet any effective vaccine, is also implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine, antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread. In addition, a health policy game against a new type of infectious disease is designed as a serious game.
226a48456c2a64616efe618baef9bc2d34ddf8b5	Asthma is a heterogeneous and chronic inflammatory family of disorders of the airways with increasing prevalence that results in recurrent and reversible bronchial obstruction and expiratory airflow limitation. These diseases arise from the interaction between environmental and genetic factors, which collaborate to cause increased susceptibility and severity. Many asthma susceptibility genes are linked to the immune system or encode enzymes like metalloproteases (e.g., ADAM-33) or serine proteases. The S9 family of serine proteases (prolyl oligopeptidases) is capable to process peptide bonds adjacent to proline, a kind of cleavageresistant peptide bonds present in many growth factors, chemokines or cytokines that are important for asthma. Curiously, two serine proteases within the S9 family encoded by genes located on chromosome 2 appear to have a role in asthma: CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and DPP10. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about CD26 and to provide a structured overview of the numerous functions and implications that this versatile enzyme could have in this disease, especially after the detection of some secondary effects (e.g., viral nasopharyngitis) in type II diabetes mellitus patients (a subset with a certain risk of developing obesity-related asthma) upon CD26 inhibitory therapy.
f3869c6d773418fb565addf6cbefb40b38dddccb	We analyzed the role of their pulmonary images in predicting the severity and diagnosis of the disease. Methods: Among 97 patients with confirmed novel H1N1 infection, 42 patients treated with mechanical ventilation formed group 1, and the remaining 55 patients constituted group 2. The initial and subsequent radiograhic findings in groups 1 and 2 were compared with respect to the pattern, distribution, and extent of the abnormality. Results: In group 1, 24 patients presented with three or more lung zone diseases, whereas only 5 patients in group 2 demonstrated these findings (P<0.001). A pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax was observed in 24/42 patients in group 1 and in 18/55 patients in group 2 (P=0.019). Twelve patients in group 1 and 5 in group 2 developed a ground-glass opacity cyst with a honeycomb appearance (P=0.007). Conclusions: The most common radiographic and computed tomography findings in children who were severely infected with S-OIV included unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation. Children with bilateral involvement or with greater opacity on the chest radiographs were more likely to worsen and require the mechanical ventilation. World J Pediatr 2012;8(3):240-246

71480d51449adc0ef61429a8f5350e460835dd39	Coronavirus disease 2019 predisposes patients to a prothrombotic state with demonstrated microvascular involvement. The degree of hypercoagulability appears to correlate with outcomes, however optimal criteria to assess for the highest risk patients for thrombotic events remain unclear; we hypothesized that deranged thromboelastography (TEG) measurements of coagulation would correlate with thromboembolic events. Patients admitted to an intensive care unit with COVID-19 diagnoses that had TEG analyses performed were studied. Conventional coagulation assays, D-dimer levels, and viscoelastic parameters were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new onset renal failure. Forty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Derangements in coagulation laboratory values including elevated D-Dimer, fibrinogen, PT, and PTT were confirmed; viscoelastic parameters showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis at 30 minutes. A complete lack of lysis of clot at 30 minutes was seen in 57% of patients and predicted VTE with an AUROC of .742 (p=0.021). A D-Dimer cutoff of 2600 ng/ml predicted need for dialysis with an AUROC of .779 (p=0.005). Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a D-Dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml had a rate of VTE of 50% compared to 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p=0.008) and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared to 14% (p=0.004). Fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography, predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown. COVID-19 ICU patients are hypercoagulable. Fibrinolysis shutdown as demonstrated by complete lack of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography combined with elevated D-Dimer levels predicts thromboembolic complications and new onset kidney failure. Patients with COVID-19 have frequent complications of venous thromboembolism, stroke, and kidney failure. A lack of any clot lysis on thromboelastogram combined with elevated D-dimer levels identifies a high-risk population potentially requiring more aggressive anticoagulation.
019c344f4e7cb623efafb8ee57dcd67602ea80f2	Background: Dihydromyricetin (DMY) is an important plant flavonoid, which has received great attention due to its health-benefiting activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic and neuroprotective activities. DMY capsules have been sold in US as a nutraceutical supplement to prevent alcoholic hangovers. The major disadvantage associated with DMY is its chemical instability and poor bioavailability caused by the combined effects of its low solubility and poor membrane permeability. This limits its practical use in the food and pharmaceutical fields. Scope and approach: The present paper gives an overview of the current methods for the identification and quantification of DMY. Furthermore, recent findings regarding the main biological properties and chemical stability of DMY, the metabolism of DMY as well as different approaches to increase DMY bioavailability in both aqueous and lipid phases are discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Current trends on identification and quantification of DMY have been focused on spectral and chromatographic techniques. Many factors such as heat, pH, metal ions, could affect the chemical stability of DMY. Despite the diverse biological effects of DMY, DMY faces with the problem of poor bioavailability. Utilization of different delivery systems including solid dispersion, nanocapsule, microemuslion, cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, co-crystallization, phospholipid complexes, and chemical or enzymatic acylation has the potential to improve both the solubility and bioavailability. DMY digested in laboratory animals undergoes reduction, dehydroxylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. Novel DMY delivery systems and basic pharmacokinetic studies of encapsulated DMY on higher animals and humans might be required in the future.

Businesses and governments are implementing technologies and policies in order to improve air quality. Despite this the PM 10 air quality in the mining town of Moranbah, Australia, has worsened since measurements commenced in 2011. The annual average PM 10 concentrations during 2012, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have all exceeded the Australian National Environmental Protection Measure's standard, and there has been an increase in the frequency of exceedances of the daily standard. The average annual increase in PM 10 was 1.2 ± 0.5 µg m −3 between 2011 and 2019 and has been 2.5 ± 1.2 µg m −3 since 2014. The cause of this has not previously been established. Here, two machine learning algorithms (gradient boosted regression and random forest) have been implemented to model and then meteorologically normalise PM 10 mass concentrations measured in Moranbah. The best performing model, using the random forest algorithm, was able to explain 59 % of the variance in PM 10 using a range of meteorological, environmental and temporal variables as predictors. An increasing trend after normalising for these factors was found of 0.6 ± 0.5 µg m −3 since 2011 and 1.7 ± 0.3 µg m −3 since 2014. These results indicate that more than half of the increase in PM 10 is due to a rise in local emissions in the region. The remainder of the rise in PM 10 was found to be due to a decrease of soil water content in the surrounding region, which can facilitate higher dust emissions. Whether the presence of open-cut coal mines exacerbated the role of soil water content is unclear. Although fires can have drastic effects on the local air quality, changes in fire patterns J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f are not responsible for the rising trend. PM 10 composition measurements or more detailed data relating to local sources is still needed to better isolate these emissions. Nonetheless, this study highlights the need and potential for action by industry and government to improve the air quality and reduce health risks for the nearby population. 65 2018). 66 3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f

On presentation to the emergency department, she was febrile (38.1 C) with mild subcostal recession and reduced air entry in the left lung base (respiratory rate 28/min, oxygen saturation 92% in room air). Chest radiograph revealed early left lower lobe consolidation (Fig. 1) . She was admitted to the ward for benzylpenicillin (45 mg/ kg/q6h intravenous injection (IVI)) and low-flow oxygen (1 L/min). Over an 8-h period, she had worsening respiratory distress, dramatic progression of chest radiograph appearances (Fig. 1) and required escalation to high-flow oxygen (2 L/kg) via nasal prongs. She was mechanically ventilated prior to transfer to a tertiary paediatric centre for the management of respiratory failure. Full blood count revealed haemoglobin 122 g/L, white cell count 16.4 × Respiratory failure and bocavirus J Huynh et al.
767771053e02a8c7d4ef22b03f938956ee80a7bc	Background: Independent of pain intensity, pain-specific distress is highly predictive of pain treatment needs, including the need for prescription opioids. Given the inherently distressing nature of chronic pain, there is a need to equip individuals with pain education and self-regulatory skills that are shown to improve adaptation and improve their response to medical treatments. Brief, targeted behavioral medicine interventions may efficiently address the key individual factors, improve self-regulation in the context of pain, and reduce the need for opioid therapy. This highlights the critical need for targeted, cost-effective interventions that efficiently address the key psychological factors that can amplify the need for opioids and increased risk for misuse. In this trial, the primary goal is to test the comparative efficacy of a single-session skills-based pain management class to a health education active control group among patients with chronic pain who are taking opioids. Methods/design: Our study is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial testing the superiority of our 2-h, singlesession skills-based pain management class against a 2-h health education class. We will enroll 136 adult patients with mixed-etiology chronic pain who are taking opioid prescription medication and randomize 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms. We hypothesize superiority for the skills-based pain class for pain control, self-regulation of pain-specific distress, and reduced opioid use measured by daily morphine equivalent. Team researchers masked to treatment assignment will assess outcomes up to 12 months post treatment. (Continued on next page) Discussion: This study aims to test the utility of a single-session, 2-h skills-based pain management class to improve self-regulation of pain and reduce opioid use. Findings from our project have the potential to shift current research and clinical paradigms by testing a brief and scalable intervention that could reduce the need for opioids and prevent misuse effectively, efficiently, and economically. Further, elucidation of the mechanisms of opioid use can facilitate refinement of more targeted future treatments. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03950791. Registered on 10 May 2019.
ae61ada1b76945aa2b42ac7cd3ea7695cf6d8fc9	Given a dominating set, how much smaller a dominating set can we find through elementary operations? Here, we proceed by iterative vertex addition and removal while maintaining the property that the set forms a dominating set of bounded size. This can be seen as the optimization variant of the dominating set reconfiguration problem, where two dominating sets are given and the question is merely whether they can be reached from one another through elementary operations. We show that this problem is PSPACE-complete, even if the input graph is a bipartite graph, a split graph, or has bounded pathwidth. On the positive side, we give linear-time algorithms for cographs, trees and interval graphs. We also study the parameterized complexity of this problem. More precisely, we show that the problem is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the upper bound on the size of an intermediary dominating set. On the other hand, we give fixed-parameter algorithms with respect to the minimum size of a vertex cover, or d + s where d is the degeneracy and s is the upper bound of the output solution.
b05cb83162f89ea9865a07d98324d150e00157e8	Background Eradicating food insecurity is necessary for achieving global health goals. Liberal trade policies might increase food supplies but how these policies influence individual-level food insecurity remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between liberal trade policies and food insecurity at the individual level, and whether this association varies across country-income and household-income groups. Institute. We examined the association between a country's trade policy score and the probability of individuals reporting moderate-severe or severe food insecurity using regression models and algorithmic weighting procedures. We controlled for multiple covariates, including gross domestic product, democratisation level, and population size. Additionally, we examined heterogeneity by country and household income. Our sample comprised 460 102 individuals in 132 countries for the period of 2014-17. Liberal trade policy was not significantly associated with moderate-severe or severe food insecurity after covariate adjustment. However, among households in high-income countries with incomes higher than US$25 430 per person per year (adjusted for purchasing power parity), a unit increase in the trade policy index (more liberal) corresponded to a 0·07% (95% CI -0·10 to -0·04) reduction in the predicted probability of reporting moderate-severe food insecurity. Among households in the lowest income decile (<$450 per person per year) in low-income countries, a unit increase in the trade policy index was associated with a 0·35% (0·06 to 0·60) increase in the predicted probability of reporting moderate-severe food insecurity. Interpretation The relationship between liberal trade policy and food insecurity varied across countries and households. Liberal trade policy was predominantly associated with lower food insecurity in high-income countries but corresponded to increased food insecurity among the world's poorest households in low-income countries.
c916b6f91bcb18ae7eac836a9f50802874560112	SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 µM. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known M pro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro with GC-376, determined at 2.15 Å resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by M pro . Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. inhibitors as SAR-CoV-2 antivirals. The M pro plays an essential role in coronavirus replication by digesting the viral polyproteins at more than 11 sites, and it appears like a high profile target for antiviral drug discovery. 9-12 The M pro has an unique substrate preference for glutamine at the P1 site (Leu-Gln(Ser,Ala,Gly)), a feature that is absent in closely related host proteases, suggesting it is feasible to achieve high selectivity by targeting viral M pro . As such, we developed the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based enzymatic assay for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro and applied it to screen a focused library of protease inhibitors. Here we report our findings of several novel hits targeting SARS-CoV-2 M pro and their mechanism of action. The in vitro antiviral activity of the hits was also evaluated in cell culture using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Overall, our study provides a list of drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 with a confirmed mechanism of action, and the results might help speed up the drug discovery efforts in combating COVID-19. The compounds identified herein represent one of the most potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors so far with both enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity. 9, 11, 12 The X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro with GC-376 showed that the compound can adapt two configurations R and S, offering a molecular explanation of the highbinding affinity of the aldehyde-containing inhibitors.

cb8b414e7e02f0e72a5217823696ab84345dde0b	Objectives: IFN-α2b and IFN-γ combination has demonstrated favorable pharmacodynamics for genes underlying antiviral activity which might be involved in the defense of the organism from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering this we conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial for efficacy and safety evaluation of subcutaneous IFN -α2b and IFNγ administration in patients positive to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We enrolled 19-82 years-old inpatients at the Military Central Hospital "Luis Diaz Soto", Havana, Cuba. They were hospitalized after confirmed diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either, subcutaneous treatment with a co-lyophilized combination of 3.0 MIU IFN-α2b and 0.5 MIU IFN-γ (HeberFERON, CIGB, Havana, Cuba), twice a week for two weeks, or thrice a week intramuscular injection of 3.0 MIU IFN-α2b (Heberon® Alpha R, CIGB, Havana, Cuba). Additionally, all patients received lopinavirritonavir 200/50 mg every 12 h and chloroquine 250 mg every 12 h (standard of care). The primary endpoints were the time to negativization of viral RNA and the time to progression to severe COVID-19, from the start of treatment. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Clinical Investigation from the Hospital and the Center for the State Control of Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices in Cuba. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. Results: A total of 79 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including symptomatic or asymptomatic conditions, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and underwent randomization. Thirty-three subjects were assigned to the HeberFERON group, and 33 to the Heberon Alpha R group. Sixty-three patients were analyzed for viral negativization, of them 78.6% in the HeberFERON group negativized the virus after 4 days of treatment versus 40.6% of patients in the Heberon Alpha R groups (p=0.004). Time to reach the negativization of the SARS-CoV-2 measured by RT-PCR in real time was of 3.0 and 5.0 days for the HeberFERON and Heberon Alpha R groups, respectively. A significant improvement in the reduction of time for negativization was attributable to HeberFERON (p=0.0027, Log-rank test) with a Hazard Ratio of 3.2 and 95% CI of 1.529 to 6.948, as compared to Heberon Alpha R treated group. Worsening of respiratory symptoms was detected in two (6.6%) and one (3.3%) patients in HeberFERON and IFN-2b groups, respectively. None of the subjects transit to severe COVID-19 during the study or the epidemiological follow-up for 21 more days. RT-PCR on day 14 after the start of the treatment was negative to SARS-CoV-2 in 100% and 91% of patients of the combination of IFNs and IFN-α2b, respectively. Negativization for HeberFERON treated patients was related to a significant increase in lymphocytes counts and an also significant reduction in CRP as early as 7 days after commencing the therapeutic schedule. All the patients in both cohorts recover by day 14 and were in asymptomatic condition and laboratory parameters return to normal values by day 14 after treatment initiation. Adverse events were identified in 31.5% of patients, 28.5% in the control group, and 34.4% in the HeberFERON group, and the most frequent were headaches (17.4%). : In a cohort of 63 hospitalized patients between 19 to 82 years-old with positive SARS-CoV-2, HeberFERON significantly negativized the virus on day 4 of treatment when comparing with IFN-α2b. Heberon Alpha R also showed efficacy for the treatment of the viral infection. Both treatments were safe and positively impact on the resolution of the symptoms. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19.
7c61a79b2b91646759f6a4e8cd11033250166d4c	Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted Alphavirus that causes chikungunya fever and has infected millions of people mainly in developing countries. The associated disease is characterized by rash, high fever and severe arthritis that can persist for years. Since the epidemic on La Réunion in 2006, CHIKV has adapted to Aedes albopictus, which also inhabits temperate regions of the eastern and western hemispheres, including Europe and the United States. A. albopictus might continue migrating north with continuing climate change and CHIKV would then no longer be confined to the developing nations. No treatment or licensed CHIKV vaccine exists. A CHIKV neutralization assay in a 384-well format by using CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was established. This assay system can be used for entry inhibitor screening under a reduced safety level (S2). Production of CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and the reaction volume are optimized. A dose dependent, specific neutralization of CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors with sera of CHIKV-infected individuals could be measured in a 384-well format. A safe and simple multiplex assay for the analysis of CHIKV neutralizing activities was developed and will be able to improve drug and vaccine development as well as it would improve the understanding of CHIKV epidemics regarding antibody responses.
d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	Zoonotic pathogens and parasites that are transmitted from vertebrates to humans are a major public health risk with high associated global economic costs. The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources. 2. We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research. 3. The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the moststudied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa. 4. Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied. 5. Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals.
02e0f1d2899187c3b0b9b9de45c5097c880a0c76	The possibility that RNA transcripts from clinical samples contain plenty of virus RNAs has not been pursued actively so far. We here developed a new tool for analyzing virus-transcribed mRNAs, not virus copy numbers, in the data of conventional and single-cell RNA-sequencing of human cells. Our pipeline, named VIRTUS (VIRal Transcript Usage Sensor), was able to detect 763 viruses including herpesviruses, retroviruses, and even SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and quantify their transcripts in the sequence data. This tool thus enabled simultaneously detecting infected cells, the composition of multiple viruses within the cell, and the endogenous host gene expression profile of the cell. This bioinformatics method would be instrumental in addressing the possible effects of covertly infecting viruses on certain diseases and developing new treatments to target such viruses. Availability and implementation VIRTUS is implemented using Common Workflow Language and Docker under a
2e6020ee37c82f42b9e3b5c8a0ce6bb4d6a5a208	Up to 70% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in working-and school-age people are asymptomatic (Poletti et al., 2020) , creating anxiety over reopening workplaces and schools around the world. In the absence of effective treatments or a vaccine, peace of mind will come only with community-based SARS-CoV-2 screening, where many people are tested on a regular basis. However, recent models show that short sample-to-answer turnaround time will be a critical property of effective screening strategies (Larremore et al., 2020). Here, we describe an RT-LAMP test for SARS-CoV-2 in raw saliva that takes about 45 minutes from sample to answer and requires only simple equipment (pipettes and a heating source). The assay has a limit of detection of 100 virions per microliter, and targets two separate regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. By combining rapid sample-to-answer turnaround time with the use of saliva, our RT-LAMP assay provides a low-complexity, portable, and robust system for real-time community screening.
d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd	Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model for assessing the communitywide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17-45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34-58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24-65% (and peak deaths 15-69%), compared to 2-9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9-18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.

The transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was previously identified as the essential protease that can cleave hemagglutinin of many subtypes of influenza virus and spike protein of coronavirus. Herein, we found that a guanine rich tract, capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplex in the presence of potassium ions, in the promoter region of human TMPRSS2 gene was quite important for gene transcriptional activity, hence affecting its function. Furthermore, 7 new synthesized benzoselenoxanthene analogues were found to enable stabilizing such G-quadruplex. More importantly, compounds can down-regulate TMPRSS2 gene expression, especially endogenous TMPRSS2 protein levels, and consequently suppress influenza A virus propagation in vitro. Our results provide a new strategy for anti-influenza A virus infection by small molecules targeting the TMPRSS2 gene G-quadruplex and thus inhibiting TMPRSS2 expression, which is valuable for developing small molecule drugs against influenza A virus and also may be a potential candidate as anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2) lead molecules. open Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:7635 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64368-8 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ fusion. HA is synthesized as a fusion-inactive precursor (HA0) that could be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 fragments. The cleavage of HA0 is a necessary step for influenza virus to be contagious, as it liberates the fusion peptide which can insert into target membranes during fusion. On the other hand, the cleavage leads HA to be in a metastable conformation that can undergo the structural rearrangements required for fusion in endosome environment. However, IAV has no HA0 processing protease, cleavage of the HA0 is primarily accomplished by the host cellular proteases 5 . Accumulating evidences suggest that, TMPRSS2, a type II transmembrane serine protease, is responsible for HA0 proteolytic cleavage of many subtype IAVs which contain a single arginine in the linker peptide between HA1 and HA2, such as H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) and H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/13) 6,7 . In animal models, TMPRSS2 deficiency protects mice against H1N1 (A/PR/8/34), mouse-adapted H1N1 (A/California/04/09) and H7N9 (A/ Anhui/1/13) influenza A virus infections 6,7 . Genetic variants with higher TMPRSS2 expression confer higher risk to severe H1N1 (pdm09) and Asian H7N9 influenza A virus 8 . Furthermore, knocking out TMPRSS2 in mice does not cause any obvious phenotypic abnormality, such as death, infertility or visible sickness 9 . In addition, more recently, it is reported that TMPRSS2 can help SARS-CoV-2 for entry into host cells through entailing S protein cleavage 10 . The critical role in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2) infection and the nonvital physiological function of TMPRSS2 highlight an antiviral strategy that targets TMPRSS2 and inspire us to find small molecules that can inhibit IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection via "chemical knockout" of TMPRSS2. In the present study, we demonstrated that a guanine-rich tract of human TMPRSS2 promoter, located 90 to 118 nucleotide upstream of the transcription start site, was important for promoter activity and capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplex, a noncanonical four-stranded DNA secondary structure that is comprised of two or more self-stack guanines quartets and was considered to be involved in regulation of gene transcription 11-13 . Next, we designed and synthesized a series of benzoselenoxanthene derivatives and found that these compounds can induce the formation of and stabilize the G-quadruplex structure in the guanine-rich tract, causing down-regulation of TMPRSS2 expression and finally resulted in a reduction of influenza A virus (A/ PR8/34) titers in vitro. Our findings suggest that inhibiting TMPRSS2 expression by G-quadruplex stabilization in TMPRSS2 promoter is a potential strategy for IAV infection therapy and novel benzoselenoxanthene derivatives own a potential as drugs against IAV infection.

633e89365f800d4e5c888ad2e2d8e580a7843065	RT-PCR targeting the conserved regions. The infection rates for mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, and HEV in rodents and shrews were 3.56%, 6.89%, and 1.66%, respectively. Partial genome fragment analysis indicated that mammarenavirus and hantavirus strains had more than 90% and 99% nucleic acid identity with Cardamones virus and Seoul virus, respectively, which cause diseases in humans. Although the present HEV strains identified are typically found worldwide, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a divergence of 16%. To our knowledge, the present work is the first report of the prevalence of mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, and rat HEV strains in rodents and shrews from Shenzhen city, China. Our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of rodent-and shrew-borne mammarenavirus and hantavirus, and the biodiversity of rat HEV isolates in Shenzhen city. The present work suggests that utilization of good hygiene habits is important to minimize the risk of zoonosis.
cc146665ee73fa1830b7c42a24cd5844346c0f39	Central nervous system (CNS) viral infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide but the systematic survey of patients admitted to hospitals with CNS infections in many countries, including Indonesia, is limited. To obtain more information regarding the causes of CNS infections in Indonesia, this study was performed to detect and identify viral agents associated with CNS infections amongst in-patients at a referral hospital in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Adult patients admitted to R.D. Kandou General Hospital with presumed CNS infection were enrolled. Cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and throat swab samples were collected and tested using molecular, serological, and virus isolation assays. A confirmed viral etiology was established in three and a probable/possible in 11 out of 74 patients. The most common was herpes simplex virus 1 (7/74, 9.5%), followed by Epstein-Barr virus (2/74, 2.7%), cytomegalovirus (1/74, 1.4%), enterovirus D68 (1/74, 1.4%), rhinovirus A (1/74, 1.4%), dengue virus (1/64, 1.6%), and Japanese encephalitis virus (1/64, 1.6%). There were 20 fatal cases (27.0%) during hospitalization in which eight were associated with viral causes. We identified herpes simplex virus 1 as the most common cause of CNS infection among adults in North Sulawesi with most of the cases remaining undiagnosed. Our study highlights the challenges in establishing the etiology of viral CNS infections and the importance of using a wide range of molecular and serological detection methods to identify CNS viruses.

7a6965ea1164ac5ad73e0f499659d413861b9861	The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt public health actions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these RNA transcript standards, full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and RNA-spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, but there are clear differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives with low amounts of virus. Adding to this, many primer-probe sets, including the "N2" and "N3" sets issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have background amplification with SARS-CoV-2-negative nasopharyngeal swabs, which may lead to inconclusive results. Our findings characterize the limitations of commonly used primer-probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.
841e062c74867b56a61c267a76fc8cb6bbf4c470	Understanding of droplet nuclei dispersion and transport characteristics can provide more engineering strategies to control transmission of airborne diseases. Droplet dispersion in a room under the conventional well-mixed and displacement ventilation is simulated. Two droplet nuclei sizes, 0.01 and 10 mm, are selected as they represent very fine and coarse droplets. The flow field is modeled using k-e RNG model. A new Eulerian drift-flux methodology is employed to model droplet phase. Under the conventional ventilation scheme, both fine and coarse droplets are homogeneously dispersed within approximately 50 s. Droplet nuclei exhibit distinctive dispersion behavior, particularly for low airflow microenvironment. After 270 s of droplet emission, gravitational settling influences the dispersion for 10 mm droplets, and concentration gradient can still be observed for displacement ventilation. r
8e48c3dfa8421df90112f15b841948809cfec5e1	Pulmonary hypertension and concomitant right ventricular failure present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the intensive care unit and have been associated with a high mortality. Significant co-morbidities and hemodynamic instability are often present, and routine critical care unit resuscitation may worsen hemodynamics and limit the chances of survival in patients with an already underlying poor prognosis. Right ventricular failure results from structural or functional processes that limit the right ventricle's ability to maintain adequate cardiac output. It is commonly seen as the result of left heart failure, acute pulmonary embolism, progression or decompensation of pulmonary hypertension, sepsis, acute lung injury, or in the perioperative setting. Prompt recognition of the underlying cause and institution of treatment with a thorough understanding of the elements necessary to optimize preload, cardiac contractility, enhance systemic arterial perfusion, and reduce right ventricular afterload are of paramount importance. Moreover, the emergence of previously uncommon entities in patients with pulmonary hypertension (pregnancy, sepsis, liver disease, etc.) and the availability of modern devices to provide support pose additional challenges that must be addressed with an indepth knowledge of this disease.
8af886cbb577c75e2f484e4c9792148fbdc95399	We describe postmortem pulmonary histopathologic findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with a spectrum of disease course, from rapid demise to prolonged hospitalization. Methods: Histopathologic findings in postmortem lung tissue from eight patients who died from COVID-19 pneumonia were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS) were performed to detect virus. Results: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was seen in all cases with a spectrum of acute phase and/or organizing phase. IHC with monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein and spike protein detected virus in areas of acute but not organizing DAD, with intracellular viral antigen and RNA expression seen predominantly in patients with duration of illness less than 10 days. Major vascular findings included thrombi in medium and large caliber vessels, platelet microthrombi detected by CD61 IHC, and fibrin microthrombi. antigen by IHC exclusively in the acute but not in the organizing phase of DAD, suggests that the virus may play a major role in initiating the acute lung injury of DAD, but when DAD progresses to the organizing phase, the virus may have been cleared from the lung by the patient's immune response. These findings suggest the possibility of a major change during the disease course of COVID-19 pneumonia that may have therapeutic implications. Frequent thrombi and microthrombi may also present potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
65d5d7a1167a109908958e0779b9e400f56319cb	Background: Recent epidemiological evidence has demonstrated a higher rate of hospitalizations and deaths among minorities. This pattern of race-ethnic disparities emerging throughout the United States raises the question of what social factors may influence spread of a highly transmissible novel coronavirus. The purpose of this study is to describe race-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities associated with COVID-19 in patients in our community in Orange County, California and understand the role of individual-level factors, neighborhood-level factors, and access to care on outcomes. Methods: This is a case-series of COVID-19 patients from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) across six-weeks between 3/12/2020 and 4/22/2020. Note, California's shelter-in-place order began on 3/19/2020. Individual-level factors included race-ethnicity status were recorded. Neighborhood-level factors from census tracts included median household income, mean household size, proportion without a college degree, proportion working from home, and proportion without health insurance were also recorded. Results: A total of 210-patients tested were COVID-19 positive, of which 73.3% (154/210) resided in Orange County. Hispanic/Latinx patients residing in census tracts below the median income demonstrated exponential growth (rate = 55.9%, R2 = 0.9742) during the study period. In addition, there was a significant difference for both race-ethnic (p < 0.001) and income bracket (p = 0.001) distributions prior to and after California's shelter-in-place. In addition, the percentage of individuals residing in neighborhoods with denser households (p = 0.046), lower levels of college graduation (p < 0.001), health insurance coverage (p = 0.01), and ability to work from home (p < 0.001) significantly increased over the same timeframe. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study examines the race-ethnic disparities in Orange County, CA, and highlights vulnerable populations that are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19. Our descriptive case series illustrates that we also need to consider socioeconomic factors, which ultimately set the stage for biological and social disparities.
055543ff5e0e0aa6403554e1bff5e996eb5a0ed2	Organisms respond in multiple ways to microbial infections. Pathogen invasion tipically triggers an inflammatory response where acute phase proteins (APP) have a key role. Pentraxins (PTX) are a family of highly conserved APP that play a part in the host defense against infection. The larger proteins of the family are simply named pentraxins, while c-reactive proteins (CRP) and serum amyloid proteins (SAA, SAP) are known as short pentraxins. Although high APP levels have been broadly associated with bacterial infections, there is a growing body of evidence revealing increased PTX, CRP and SAP expression upon viral infection. Furthermore, CRP, PTX and SAP have shown their potential as diagnostic markers and predictors of disease outcome. Likewise, the measurement of APP levels can be valuable to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies and vaccines. From the practical point of view, the ability of APP to reduce viral infectivity has been observed in several virus-host models. This has prompted investigation efforts to assess the role of acute phase response proteins as immunoregulatory molecules and their potential as therapeutic reagents. This work aims to present an overview of the APP response to viral infections reviewing the current knowledge in the field.
ce29d6fd830328479838bff6e1e4f5372702abeb	Antibody immunotherapy is revolutionizing modern medicine. The field has advanced dramatically over the past 40 years, driven in part by major advances in isolation and manufacturing technologies that have brought these important biologics to the forefront of modern medicine. However, the global uptake of monoclonal antibody (mAb) biologics is impeded by biophysical and biochemical liabilities, production limitations, the need for cold-chain storage and transport, as well as high costs of manufacturing and distribution. Some of these hurdles may be overcome through transient in vivo gene delivery platforms, such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors that are engineered to encode optimized mAb genes. These approaches turn the body into a biological factory for antibody production, eliminating many of the steps involved in bioprocesses and providing several other significant advantages, and differ from traditional gene therapy (permanent delivery) approaches. In this review, we focus on nucleic acid delivery of antibody employing synthetic plasmid DNA vector platforms, and RNA delivery, these being important approaches that are advancing simple, rapid, in vivo expression and having an impact in animal models of infectious diseases and cancer, among others. Direct in vivo delivery of synthetic nucleic acidencoded antibodies employing plasmid DNA [plasmid DNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies (pDNA-mAbs)] and messenger RNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies (mRNA-mAbs) platforms represent new approaches for the in vivo delivery of antibody-like biologics. While there are more preclinical data using pDNA-mAbs, both platforms have made significant progress and are demonstrating promising efficacy in infectious disease and cancer studies in small and large animal models. These platforms have advantages such as rapid product development and simpler manufacturing processes, yet they represent different strategies for deployment, with unique advantages and challenges.
d22cc0e2663c9c85d6bc889bc3deb1b24152281e	El primer impulso oficial fue subestimarlo todo. El paso virulento y mórbidamente incontenible del COVID 19 en los países del norte en los primeros días de Marzo, resonaba aquí en los contextos del sur -la periferia del capitalismo -como el eco de una realidad tan lejana que mal llegaría a tocar suelo comunitario. Mientras Roma, Barcelona o Madrid enfrentaban los severos dilemas de una cuarentena obligada, las interpretaciones en algunos contextos latinoamericanos eran mediadas por el claro matiz de clase que configura nuestras relaciones: "Es una enfermedad de ricos", "los pobres no viajan en avión, entonces eso aquí no entra", avizoraban algunos de los agüeros gubernamentales. Guiados por tales premoniciones, en pocos días creció el "negacionismo" latinoamericano. Apenas comenzaba Marzo y Brasil todavía se recuperaba de la resaca por el irrenunciable carnaval, mientras la vida seguía tal cual en el resto de región. En menos de cinco días, la faceta negacionista quedó claramente expuesta cuando algunos gobiernos incitaban a las primeras aglomeraciones, aduciendo estar "totalmente preparados" para enfrentar los efectos de la Pandemia. 2 Nicaragua mostró lo inimaginable. Apenas se habían confirmado los primeros casos positivos en Centroamérica, cuando el sábado 14 de Marzo el gobierno de Daniel Ortega convocó a un acto masivo en diversas ciudades del país para promover la "eficiencia del sistema de salud". Desde entonces, en menos de 90 días, y contrariando las recomendaciones de la OMS, el oficialismo ya había confirmado la realización de al menos 1,500 eventos públicos en apenas un fin de semana, entre ferias gastronómicas, torneos de beisbol, boxeo, voleibol, fiestas en parques y más marchas.
3dcb28bb478093d33a1c63c70a2adf3760659c9e	Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.
9bda60a5736d4582448f8f600a2fe609b02b7419	Since the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection was reported in 1997, this highly pathogenic virus has infected hundreds of people around the world and resulted in many deaths. The ability of H5N1 to cross species boundaries, and the presence of polymorphisms that enhance virulence, present challenges to developing clear strategies to prevent the pandemic spread of this highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. This review summarizes the current understanding of, and recent research on, the avian influenza H5N1 virus, including transmission, virulence, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, treatment and prevention.

858328fa401a17ec85f1e224aa4a696bb67ed9c9	The present outbreak as consequence by coronavirus covid19 has generated an big impact over the world. South American countries had their own limitations, challengues and pandemic has highlighted what needs to improve. Peru is a country with good start with quarantine, social distancing policies but the policies was not enough during the weeks. So, the analysis over April is performed through infoveillance using posts from different cities to analyze what population was living or worried during this month. Results presents a high concern about international context, and national situation, besides Economy and Politics are issues to solve. By constrast, Religion and Transport are not very important for peruvian citizens.
6197ad8a64b3fdbb868d76995338e8c85350beac	Recent policy documents position engineering as a way to broaden participation for students in STEM fields. However, a recent review of the literature on engineering education found that fewer than 1% of reviewed articles focused on issues of equity and broadening participation. For this reason, there are few frameworks to build on when designing for equitable engineering instruction in K-12 settings. Diversifying participation in engineering means that we need to not just bring learners into existing engineering practices, structures, and ways of knowing, but that we take a critical look at the field of engineering education and challenge researchers and educators to create learning opportunities that build on diverse ways of knowing about engineering and being engineers in the world, with a focus on relating course materials to learners' everyday lives. In this paper, we leverage the diverse histories, epistemologies, and ways of knowing in engineering to outline the possibilities for learners to critically engage with engineering in K-12 settings and we ask the question, "How can we design learning environments to help students critically understand the intrinsic and systemic sociotechnical relationships between people, communities, and the built environment?" To answer this question, we propose an instructional framework for developing learners' critical sociotechnical literacy, which is a place-based approach for critically engaging learners in understanding the impacts of engineering and technology on their own communities and everyday lives in order to restory these spaces for a more equitable and just future.
6642a3a9cff3380628946b0ba6de8b03d9f47278	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious, rapidly progressive, emerging disease. Early diagnosis and preventive measures are key for treatment and minimization of secondary spread. In the context of the armed forces, aggressive containment measures are essential to prevent an outbreak. In this study, we present the first reported case, to our knowledge, of SARS in a naval diver. The special physical requirements for divers and the potential complications associated with deep sea diving necessitate extensive investigation before certification of fitness for diving after SARS. In the early recovery period, potential problems during diving are caused by inadequate lung ventilation in relation to exercise level and increased breathing resistance attributable to weak respiratory muscles, with corresponding risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as decreased ability to respond to nonrespiratory problems during diving. Problems in the late recovery period include increased risk of diving complications (such as pulmonary barotrauma) resulting from fibrosis and scarring within the lung parenchyma, which are known complications of SARS. From our experience, we suggest that computed tomographic scans of the thorax, lung function tests, and careful follow-up monitoring should play a vital role in the assessment of patients during the convalescent period, before certification of fitness to dive.
76d24b67f8dfb470083da0352c247b6d218686d5	Oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) is a novel form of immunotherapy using natural or genetically modified viruses to selectively replicate in and kill malignant cells. Many genetically modified oncolytic viruses (OVs) with enhanced tumor targeting, antitumor efficacy, and safety have been generated, and some of which have been assessed in clinical trials. Combining OVT with other immunotherapies can remarkably enhance the antitumor efficacy. In this work, we review the use of wild-type viruses in OVT and the strategies for OV genetic modification. We also review and discuss the combinations of OVT with other immunotherapies.
179a3e8faad2c657015ddeb91ea52bb9bd83724d	This paper is concerned with nonlinear modeling and analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic currently ravaging the planet. There are two objectives: to arrive at an appropriate model that captures the collected data faithfully and to use that as a basis to explore the nonlinear behavior. We use a nonlinear susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed transmission model with added behavioral and government policy dynamics. We develop a genetic algorithm technique to identify key model parameters employing COVID-19 data from South Korea. Stability, bifurcations and dynamic behavior are analyzed. Parametric analysis reveals conditions for sustained epidemic equilibria to occur. This work points to the value of nonlinear dynamic analysis in pandemic modeling and demonstrates the dramatic influence of social and government behavior on disease dynamics.
faf6ebb5569adcfc62728f1893751805839695d7	We studied 1859 subjects with confirmed COVID-19 from seven centers in Wuhan 1651 of whom recovered and 208 died. We interrogated diverse covariates for correlations with risk of death from COVID-19. In multi-variable Cox regression analyses increased hazards of in-hospital death were associated with several admission covariates: (1) older age (HR = 1.04; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.03, 1.06 per year increase; P < 0.001); (2) smoking (HR = 1.84 [1.17, 2.92]; P = 0.009); (3) admission temperature per°C increase (HR = 1.32 [1.07, 1.64]; P = 0.009); (4) Log 10 neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; HR = 3.30 [2.10, 5.19]; P < 0.001); (5) platelets per 10 E + 9/L decrease (HR = 0.996 [0.994, 0.998]; P = 0.001); (6) activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT) per second increase (HR = 1.04 [1.02, 1.05]; P < 0.001); (7) Log 10 D-dimer per mg/l increase (HR = 3.00 [2.17, 4.16]; P < 0.001); and (8) Log 10 serum creatinine per μmol/L increase (HR = 4.55 [2.72, 7.62]; P < 0.001). In piecewise linear regression analyses Log 10 NLR the interval from ≥0.4 to ≤1.0 was significantly associated with an increased risk of death. Our data identify covariates associated with risk of in hospital death in persons with COVID-19.
20c05a8e1616b61a78300ee5911bc70bd1c952d3	The leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa (Lythraceae), a Southeast Asian tree more commonly known as banaba, have been traditionally consumed in various forms by Philippinos for treatment of diabetes and kidney related diseases. In the 1990s, the popularity of this herbal medicine began to attract the attention of scientists worldwide. Since then, researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba. Scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity. Using tumor cells as a cell model, corosolic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound. More recently, a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds. The ellagitannin Lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity. In a different approach, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method, Chen et al. showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin-like glucose transport inducing activity. Coupling HPLC fractionation with a glucose uptake assay, gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity, not corosolic acid. Penta-O-galloyl-glucopyranose (PGG) was identified as the most potent gallotannin. A comparison of published data with results obtained for PGG indicates that PGG has a significantly higher glucose transport stimulatory activity than Lagerstroemin. Chen et al. have also shown that PGG exhibits anti-adipogenic properties in addition to stimulating the glucose uptake in adipocytes. The combination of glucose uptake and anti-adipogenesis activity is not found in the current insulin mimetic drugs and may indicate a great therapeutic potential of PGG.
f6debbbad0ccb86ed44280a856901d702466f819	The COVID-19 imposed lockdown has led to a number of temporary environmental side effects (reduced global emissions, cleaner air, less noise), that the climate community has aspired to achieve over a number of decades. However, these benefits have been achieved at a massive cost to welfare and the economy. This commentary draws lessons from the COVID-19 crisis for climate change. It discusses whether there are more sustainable ways of achieving these benefits, as part of a more desirable, low carbon resilient future, in a more planned, inclusive and less disruptive way. In order to achieve this, we argue for a clearer social contract between citizens and the state. We discuss how COVID-19 has demonstrated that behaviours can change abruptly, that these changes come at a cost, that we need a 'social mandate' to ensure these changes remain in the long-term, and that science plays an important role in informing this process. We suggest that deliberative engagement mechanisms, such as citizens' assemblies and juries, could be a powerful way to build a social mandate for climate action post-COVID-19. This would enable behaviour changes to become more accepted, embedded and bearable in the long-term and provide the basis for future climate action.

de0cf601646c537ec39f7a7807331db531551860	Simple Summary: In this study we isolated and characterized potential probiotic bifidobacteria from sow milk. The bifidobacterial population in milk has been attributed to the existence of prebiotic oat in feeding systems. Since breast feeding protects the newborns against several infectious diseases, milk from sows fed with oat could improve the health of piglets. Abstract: The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate the impact of feeding oat on the population of bifidobacteria and (ii) evaluate their probiotic potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of supplementing sows' gestation and lactation feed with 15% oat (prebiotic source) on the levels of probiotic population in milk. We found that dietary inclusion of oat during lactation and gestation resulted in increased levels of bifidobacteria compared to lactobacilli in sow milk. Furthermore bifidobacteria within the sow milk samples were further evaluated for probiotic potential based on aggregating properties, and acid-and bile-tolerance after exposure to hydrochloric acid (pH 2.5) and bile salts (0%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 1.0% and 2.0%). All isolates survived under the condition of low pH and bile 2.0%. Autoaggregation ability ranged from 17.5% to 73%. These isolates also showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7. Together our results suggest that inclusion of oat in feeding systems could have the potential to improve the intestinal health of piglets by increasing the population of bifidobacteria.

bcc31dbf00e910f2da16b975ce2585d04ee4c652	Holder pasteurization (62.5ºC, 30 min) of human milk (HM) is thought to reduce the risk of transmitting viruses to an infant. Some viruses may be secreted into milk -others may be contaminants. The effect of thermal pasteurization on viruses in HM has yet to be rigorously reviewed. The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of commonly used pasteurization techniques on viruses in HM and non-HM matrices. Databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) were searched from inception to April 20 th , 2020 for primary research articles assessing the impact of pasteurization on viral load or detection of live virus. Reviews were excluded, as were studies lacking quantitative measurements or those assessing pasteurization as a component of a larger process. Overall, 65,131 reports were identified, and 108 studies included. Pasteurization of HM at a minimum temperature of 56ºC-60ºC is effective at reducing detectable live virus. In cell culture media or plasma, coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS) are highly susceptible to heating at ≥ 56ºC. Although pasteurization parameters and matrices reported vary, all viruses studied, with the exception of parvoviruses, were susceptible to thermal killing. Future research important for the study of novel viruses should standardize pasteurization protocols and should test viral inactivation using a human milk matrix. • In all matrices, including human milk, pasteurization at temperatures of 62.5ºC was generally sufficient to reduce surviving viral load by several logs or to below the limit of detection. • Holder pasteurization (62.5ºC, 30 min) of human donor milk should be sufficient to inactivate non-heat resistant viruses, including coronaviruses, if present.

37dc411c474ebe575d25d7c46fbb6f34e805ce7f	We study the dynamics of epidemics in a networked metapopulation model. In each subpopulation, representing a locality, disease propagates according to a modified susceptible-exposedinfected-recovered (SEIR) dynamics. We assume that individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities. The susceptible and exposed (pre-symptomatic and infectious) individuals are allowed to travel between localities undetected. To investigate the combined effects of mobility and contact reduction on disease progression within interconnected localities, we consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of undetected pre-symptomatic individuals. We associate the behavior change at the disease-importing locality due to the outbreak size at the origin with the level of preparedness of the locality. Our results show that restricting mobility is valuable if the importing locality is increasing its level of preparedness with respect to the outbreak size at the origin. Moreover, increased levels of preparedness can yield lower total outbreak size by further reducing the outbreak size at the importing locality, even when the response at the origin is weak. Our results highlight that public health decisions on social distancing at localities with less severe outbreaks should strongly account for potential impact of neighbouring localities with a poor response to the outbreak rather than localities with successful responses.
68cc9cab4dba8749ec119008dac426ad4c6f6746	• There is a consensus on three critical issues in the screening and management of GDM during the COVID-19 crisis. •Replace OGGT with alternative tests(FBG, A1C, RPG) during 24-28 weeks of gestation. •Defer or delay postpartum screening and use telemedicine to discover clinical symptoms •Compare the benefits of standard care with the risks of exposure to COVID-19 Background and aims: New clinical approaches are needed to minimize complications of gestational diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak with timely screening and proper management. The present study aims to highlight changes in the clinical guideline for gestational diabetes during the pandemic. Methods: In a narrative review, multiple databases were searched. Furthermore, online searches were conducted to identify guidelines or support documents provided by NGOs, local health authorities, and societies and organizations in the field of diabetes and obstetrics. Results: We included five national guidelines that were published in English from Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Australia health agencies. FBG, A1C, RPG were recommended as alternative tests instead of a 2hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) for GDM screening at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Recommendations also included a deferral of postpartum screening till the end of the pandemic, or postponement of testing to 6-12 months after delivery, use telemedicine and telecare. Conclusions: Updated temporary changes in clinical guidelines are sensible and accommodates social distancing and minimizes risk of exposure to COVID-19. Despite many unsolved controversies in screening, treatment, and follow-up of gestational diabetes, it seems involvement with novel coronavirus have made a reach to a global agreement simpler.

478b438a3d890c8a224321781dee4b46e21b9ca1	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a rapidly spreading global pathogen stressing the need for development of rapid testing protocols ever than before. The aim of present study was to develop a SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol which can be performed within minimal resources and timeframe. For this purpose, we implemented the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) methodology for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In order to improve the detection capability, the RT-LAMP assay was developed to simultaneously amplify two viral genes: ORF1a and N. A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 25 non-COVID-19 cases were enrolled. Viral RNA was extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab samples and analyzed simultaneously using PCR and RT-LAMP protocols. Overall, our SARS-CoV-2 dual gene RT-LAMP assay was found to be 95% accurate in detecting positive cases and showed no cross-reactivity or false-positive results in non-COVID-19 samples. Further evaluation on larger and multi-centric cohorts is currently underway to establish the diagnostic accuracy and subsequent implementation into clinical practice and at point-of-care settings.

418f2ee310f6712eda02a2568dd38b0d9a76f64e	In the search for factors affecting incidence and lethality of the current COVID-19 pandemic, recent association studies explored the possible role of vitamin D deficiency. Altogether, these studies, in most cases based on cross-sectional analyses, could not yet provide a convincing demonstration of a cause-effect relationship. In this editorial, the authors describe the scientific evidence underlying a possible role of vitamin D in the prevention and development of the pandemic, considering its immunomodulatory role and antiviral effects. They conclude that further studies are needed to (1) better explore possible associations between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 morbidity and lethality, and (2) assess if compensating such deficiency could avoid or mitigate the worst manifestations of COVID-19. They highlight the need for public health campaigns to promote consumption of vitamin D-rich foods and proper sunlight exposition or, when this is not possible, controlled pharmaceutical supplementation, especially in countries with high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D.

6a1a845906b82ed7fe3a678a08c90f5956064bcb	This paper describes the predicted structure for the cps loci involved in capsule biosynthesis for Streptococcus parauberis serotypes III, IV, and V. Based on the specific serotype regions I, II, and III, a multiplex PCR protocol (mPCR) was designed to differentiate the main serotypes causing fish diseases. A real-time PCR method (qPCR) is also described to identify S. parauberis of serotype III in bacterial cultures and fish tissues. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed that both methods have a 100% specificity. The mPCR assay was optimized for the detection of S. parauberis strains of subtypes Ia (amplicon size 213 bp), subtypes Ib and Ic (both amplicon size 303 bp), serotype II (amplicon size 403 bp), and serotype III (amplicon size 130 bp) from bacterial cultures. The qPCR assay was optimized for the identification and quantification of S. parauberis serotype III strains in bacterial cultures and fish tissues. This assay achieved a sensitivity of 2.67 × 10 2 gene copies (equivalent to 3.8 × 10 −9 ng/μl) using pure bacterial cultures of S. parauberis serotype III and 1.76 × 10 2 gene copies in fish tissues experimentally and naturally infected with S. parauberis of the serotype III. The specificity and sensitivity of the protocols described in this study suggest that these methods could be used for diagnostic and/or epidemiological purposes in clinical diagnostic laboratories. • Structure of loci cps for S. parauberis of serotypes III, IV and V was described. • mPCR to differentiate S. parauberis serotypes causing disease in fish was optimized. • qPCR assay to quantify strains of S. parauberis serotype III in fish tissues.
444c855c68f82281c9ce8f6b2b0c0d7c6c658c66	The employment status of billions of people has been affected by the COVID epidemic around the Globe. New evidence is needed on how to mitigate the job market crisis, but there exists only a handful of studies mostly focusing on developed countries. We fill in this gap in the literature by using novel data from Ukraine, a transition country in Eastern Europe, which enacted strict quarantine policies early on. We model four binary outcomes to identify respondents (i) who are not working during quarantine, (ii) those who are more likely to work from home, (iii) respondents who are afraid of losing a job, and, finally, (iv) survey participants who have savings for 1 month or less if quarantine is further extended. Our findings suggest that respondents employed in public administration, programming and IT, as well as highly qualified specialists, were more likely to secure their jobs during the quarantine. Females, better educated respondents, and those who lived in Kyiv were more likely to work remotely. Working in the public sector also made people more confident about their future employment perspectives. Although our findings are limited to urban households only, they provide important early evidence on the correlates of job market outcomes, expectations, and financial security, indicating potential deterioration of socio-economic inequalities.
6ab55fd404dc1987435bb3fd1b1a7d02c0951f08	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the leading causes of lower respiratory tract infection in infants. Immunoprophylaxis with the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk for RSV-related hospitalizations, but its use is restricted to high-risk infants due to the high costs. In this study, we investigated if genetic delivery of anti-RSV antibody to neonatal mice by chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 expressing the murine form of palivizumab (AdC7αRSV) can provide protection against RSV. Intranasal and intramuscular administration of AdC7αRSV to adult mice resulted in similar levels of anti-RSV IgG in the serum. However, only intranasal administration resulted in detectable levels of anti-RSV IgG in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Intranasal administration of AdC7αRSV provided protection against subsequent RSV challenge. Expression of the anti-RSV antibody was prolonged following intranasal administration of AdC7αRSV to neonatal mice. Protection against RSV was confirmed at 6 weeks of age. These data suggest that neonatal genetic delivery of anti-RSV antibody by AdC7αRSV can provide protection against RSV.
c4c450f4657fe9e5db4dcc2aea4c2da29cce268e	Previous studies demonstrated a higher COVID-19 fatality rate in men. The aim of this study was to compare age and comorbidities between women and men who died from COVID-19. We retrospectively analyzed data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1 and May 9, 2020. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independently significant variables associated with gender in patients who died from COVID-19. The model was adjusted for age and comorbidities known to be associated with COVID-19 mortality. We identified 6760 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Of these patients, 3018/6760 (44.6%) were women. The mortality rate was higher for men (women 18.2% vs. men 20.6%, p = 0.039). Of the patients who died, women were on average 5 years older than men (woman 77.4 ± 12.7 vs. men 72.4 ± 13.0, p < 0.001). In the multivariable model, cardiovascular comorbidities were not significantly different between women and men. Chronic kidney disease (aOR for women 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) and smoking (aOR for women 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) were more common in men. Age decile (aOR for women 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) and obesity (aOR for women 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-3.0) were higher in women. This study demonstrates that women who died of COVID-19 showed a similar cardiovascular disease profile as men. Yet, they are 5 years older than men. Investigating the gender impacts of COVID-19 is an important part of understanding the disease behavior.

7fe2e9368686cd151ef348f92d72aa053ac91eb4	The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, but there are wide variations in prevalence and mortality across nations. Genetic variants which influence behavioural or immune responses to pathogens, selected for by pathogen pressure, may influence this variability. Two relevant polymorphisms in this context are the s allele of the serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) and the G allele of the interleukin-6 gene (IL-6 rs1800795). Methods: The frequencies of the 5-HTTLPR s allele and IL-6 rs1800795 G allele were obtained from published data. The correlations between these allele frequencies and the prevalence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were examined across 44 nations. The IL-6 rs1800795 G allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence (ρ = -0.466, p < 0.01) and mortality (ρ = -0.591, p<0.001) across nations. The 5-HTTLPR s allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality rates (ρ = -0.437, p = 0.023). Conclusions: These results suggest that a significant relationship exists between genetic variants that influence behavioural and immune responses to pathogens and indices of the impact of COVID-19
5c80af2a5bc7251e2666ea2e6c3b3e8ec527cf2a	Weight and obesity management is one of the emerging challenges in current health management. Nutrient-gene interactions in human obesity (NUGENOB) seek to find various solutions to challenges posed by obesity and over-weight. This research was based on utilising a dietary intervention method as a means of addressing the problem of managing obesity and overweight. The dietary intervention program was done for a period of ten weeks. Traditional statistical techniques have been utilised in analyzing the potential gains in weight and diet intervention programs. This work investigates the applicability of machine learning to improve on the prediction of body weight in a dietary intervention program. Models that were utilised include Dynamic model, Machine Learning models (Linear regression, Support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)). The performance of these estimation models was compared based on evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAE and R2. The results indicate that the Machine learning models (ANN and RF) perform better than the other models in predicting body weight at the end of the dietary intervention program.
6215848fd26306ae943ce2c39f4cbdfe9f3a3342	Time and again, many organizations and their staff members must respond to unexpected catastrophes like hurricanes (e.g., Katrina), virus pandemics (e.g., COVID-19), or other major emergencies. As a result, some organizations allow their employees to respond to external emergencies by engaging in response actions for a limited time, like in the case of emergency response teams. The latter teams consist of employees that act as emergency response officers who can respond to floods, train crashes, or other emergencies. Emergency response teams constitute an example of so-called latent organizing (LO) in the preparation for and response to any (unpredictable) future emergency. While latent organizing is ubiquitous in a societal and professional sense, it has hardly been studied in the organization design literature. In this paper, we develop a research agenda for studying LO. LO serves to prepare for and respond to emergencies, but otherwise remains largely dormant and inactive. When it is inactive, host organizations use the LO's human and other resources for their own gainful purposes. Resources for LO are thus organized in a quasi-permanent fashion, one that is rather latent until activated by an emergency. We further develop the construct of latency to explore how effective LO can be designed and facilitated. In addition, we develop a research agenda for future work in this area.
22c7095af29d309d9b6f1885625cb0d73728d3ef	Covid-19 pandemic has increased significantly to mortality in many countries with the number of infected cases increasing exponentially worldwide. One of the main determining factors of the poor prognosis in these patients is the development of coagulopathy. Moreover, it is well known that ART procedures confer a risk of thromboembolic complications. In this commentary we analize specific coexisting aspects between the thrombotic risk described during virus infection and that one reported in the context of assisted reproduction treatments. Based on known pathophysiological aspects of both virus infection and those identified during ovarian stimulation (OS), we found common elements that deserve to be taken into account. In the present context, any risk of hyperstimulation should be avoided. GnRh agonist triggering should be mandatory in high responders patients and/or with COVID infection. In both cases, the cycle should be segmented. We propose prophylactic with low molecular weigth heparin (LMWH) not only in those cases in which the oocyte recovery has been performed, but also in those in which the cancellation has been decided. In addition, the endometrial preparation to the frozen-thawed embryo transfers (FETs) should be using the transdermal route in order to minimize the higher thrombotic risk of the oral route.
26cfe1240e8cc3df84b4e622c35e2697e5512c06	Acute gastroenteritis accounts for a significant burden of medically attended illness in children under the age of five. For this study, four multiplex reverse transcription PCR assays were used to determine the incidence of adenovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, norovirus GI and GII, rotavirus, and sapovirus in stool samples submitted for viral electron microscopy (EM) to the Children's Hospital Colorado. Of 1105 stool samples available, viral RNA/DNA was detected in 247 (26.2%) of 941 pediatric samples (median age ¼ 2.97 years, 54% male) with 28 (3.0%) positive for more than one virus. Adenovirus, astrovirus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, rotavirus, and sapovirus were detected in 95 (10.0%), 33 (3.5%), 8 (0.9%), 90 (9.6%), 49 (5.2%), and 2 (0.2%) of the pediatric samples, respectively. No coronaviruses were identified. Sequencing of norovirus positive samples indicated an outbreak of norovirus strain GII.4 in 2006 with evidence of numerous circulating strains. Multiple samples from the same immunocompromised patients demonstrated symptomatic shedding of norovirus for up to 32 weeks and astrovirus for 12 weeks. RT-PCR detected 99 of 111 (89%) adenovirus-positive samples versus 12 (11%) by EM, and 186 of 192 (97%) sapovirus/astrovirus/ norovirus-positive samples versus 21 (11%) by EM. Noroviruses and adenoviruses are common causes of gastroenteritis in children. Immunocompromised patients can be infected with multiple viruses and shed viruses in their stools for prolonged periods. This data support the superiority of RT-PCR compared to EM for diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis.
d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9	In multiple sclerosis lesions, remyelination typically fails with repeated or chronic demyelinating episodes and results in neurologic disability. Acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination. In the current study, we used a mouse model of chronic demyelination induced by continuous ingestion of 0.2% cuprizone for 12 weeks. This chronic process depleted the oligodendrocyte progenitor population and impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration. Remyelination remained limited after removal of cuprizone from the diet. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice. We used FGF2 j/j mice to determine whether removal of endogenous FGF2 promoted remyelination of chronically demyelinated areas. Wild-type and FGF2 j/j mice exhibited similar demyelination during chronic cuprizone treatment. Importantly, in contrast to wild-type mice, the FGF2 j/j mice spontaneously remyelinated completely during the recovery period after chronic demyelination. Increased remyelination in FGF2 j/j mice correlated with enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration. FGF2 genotype did not alter the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or proliferating cells after chronic demyelination. These findings indicate that attenuating FGF2 created a sufficiently permissive lesion environment for endogenous cells to effectively remyelinate viable axons even after chronic demyelination.
8f61eb2da6f8e947a03bdf5afa69c49d9e892fb8	Feline 1 -acid glycoprotein (fAGP) increases during feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). We have recently identified a 29 kDa protein that we named feline AGP-related protein (fAGPrP) due to its cross-reactivity with an anti-human AGP monoclonal antibody. In this work we describe the tissue distribution of fAGPrP during FIP, and its relationship with feline coronavirus (FCoV) and myeloid cells. Tissues from five control cats and from 15 cats with FIP were examined by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against human AGP, FCoV and myeloid antigens. Diffuse fAGPrP positivity within the lesions, likely due to vascular plasma leakage, endothelial and epithelial lining were detectable. Compared to controls, fAGPrP-expressing cells often increased in number and were diffusely distributed in lymph nodes, as usually occurs for IgM-producing plasma cells during early immune responses. These findings did not depend on the presence of FCoVs or of myeloid cells, suggesting that fAGPrP is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of FIP.
06be5e4218fb3dec317b404ed42083390e696004	Astrocytes isolated from the brain of newborn Lewis rats and an astrocytic cell line were susceptible to infection with the neurotropic Borna disease virus in vitro. Since astrocytes also have been found to be infected in vivo it seemed appropriate to test this cell type for interaction with a Borna disease virus-specific CD 4 + T cell line. Borna disease virus-infected astrocytes were found to be capable of presenting virus-specific antigen to virus-specific T cells in vitro. However, the response was significantly enhanced if the purified 38/39 kDa Borna disease virus-specific protein was added exogenously to the cultures. Beside the function as antigen-presenting cells for various antigens including virus-specific protein and myelin basic protein, persistently infected astrocytes were also found to act as target cells for a CD 4 + T cell line as shown in conventional 51Cr release assays after induction of MHC class iI expression by gamma interferon. Infection of astrocytes alone did not cause expression of this self antigen. It could be shown that the ability of CD 4 + BDV-specific T cells to mediate lysis was in part dependent on the stage of activation. Lymphocytes "activated" before testing exerted high lysis after only 4 h of coincubation with target cells, whereas "resting" T cells did not cause significant lysis until 12h of coincubation. The dependence of the interaction between effector and target cells on MHC class II antigen was demonstrated by the finding that antibodies to Ia antigens reduced lysis of target cells.

aec19b12e4415f849724104d63b8c9990ad88d11	An increasing number of individuals undertake air travel annually. Issues regarding cabin air quality and the potential risks of transmission of respiratory infections during flight have been investigated and debated previously, but, with the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza outbreaks, these issues have recently taken on heightened importance. Anecdotally, many people complain of respiratory symptoms following air travel. However, studies of ventilation systems and patient outcomes indicate the spread of pathogens during flight occurs rarely. In the present review, aspects of the aircraft cabin environment that affect the likelihood of transmission of respiratory pathogens on airplanes are outlined briefly and evidence for the occurrence of outbreaks of respiratory illness among airline passengers are reviewed. (Intern Med J 2005; 35: 50-55) 
843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4	This study employed a multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to model the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets in quiescent air. The approach is featured with a continuity equation being explicitly solved for water vapor, which allows comprehensively considering the effects of inhomogeneous humidity field on droplets evaporation and movement. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations based on the approach achieved a satisfactory agreement with the theoretical models reported in the literature. The results demonstrated that the evaporation-generated vapor and super-saturated wet air exhaled from the respiratory tracks forms a "vapor plume" in front of the respiratory track opening, which, despite the short life time, significantly impedes the evaporation of the droplets captured in it. The study also revealed that due to the droplet size reduction induced by evaporation, both the number density of airborne droplets and mass concentration of inhalable pathogens remarkably increased, which can result in a higher risk of infection. Parametric studies were finally conducted to evaluate the factors affecting droplet evaporation. Summary: The study demonstrated the importance of considering inhomogeneous humidity field when modelling the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets. The multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian model presented in this study provides a comprehensive approach to address different influential factors in a wide parametric range, which will enhance the assessment of the health risks associated with droplet exposure.
36abdfdc52ca14f4c2a8b6105d03b5734bd568da	The widespread antigenic changes lead to the emergence of a new type of coronavirus (CoV) called as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 that is immunologically different from the previous circulating species. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) is one of the most important receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells (HCs) which its interaction with spike protein (SP) with a furincleavage site results in the SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Hence, in this review, we presented an overview on the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP. As several kinds of CoVs, from various genera, have at their S1/S2 binding site a preserved site, we further surveyed the role of furin cleavage site (FCS) on the life cycle of the CoV. Furthermore, we discussed that the small molecular inhibitors can limit the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP and can be used as potential therapeutic platforms to combat the spreading CoV epidemic. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future prospects for the development of potential drugs to promote targeting specific activities of the CoV were reviewed. In conclusion, this review may pave the way for providing useful information about different compounds involved in improving the effectiveness of CoV vaccine or drugs with minimum toxicity against human health. ARTICLE HISTORY
d6581ad9edc5425dc84c79a81854e113ca5c8fb2	Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is one of the four major viral pathogens associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) and creates a substantial burden of disease, particularly in young children (<5 years) and older individuals (≥65 years). The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiological behavior of HMPV in Mexico. This retrospective study was conducted over a nine-year period and used 7283 influenza-negative respiratory samples from hospitalized and deceased patients who presented Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The samples were processed with the help of qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for simultaneous detection of 14 respiratory viruses (xTAG ® RVP FAST v2). 40.8% of the samples were positive for respiratory viruses, mainly rhinovirus/enterovirus (47.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), HMPV (11.1%) and parainfluenza virus (8.9%). Other respiratory viruses and co-infections accounted for 16.5%. HMPV infects all age groups, but the most affected group was infants between 29 days and 9 years of age (65.6%) and adults who are 40 years and older (25.7%). HMPV circulates every year from November to April, and the highest circulation was observed in late winter. The results of this study aim to raise awareness among clinicians about the high epidemiological impact of HMPV in young children and older individuals in order to reduce the economic burden in terms of health care costs.
e494ed8c504a8312c9df7936a8fc832e86d444e6	The tick is a well-known vector for arthropod-borne pathogens, such as tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, Japanese spotted fever and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. It is therefore important to know the tick population and distribution in our environment and wild animals in order to prevent tick-borne diseases. Here, we report the results of tick surveillance from May to September 2011 at 14 geographical points and in 5 wild boars in Kyoto City, Kyoto prefecture, Japan. We collected 3,198 ticks comprising 5 tick species, Haemaphysalis (H.) longicornis, H. flava, H. kitaokai, Amblyomma testudinarium and Dermacentor taiwanensis. Interestingly, the proportion of tick species varied according to geographical region within the city. The ticks collected in the city were reported as potential vectors of pathogens, such as rickettsiosis. We detected rickettsial DNA by PCR in 71.1% of 201 ticks investigated. The ticks that carried rickettsiae were distributed across the whole the city. The sequences of PCR-amplified DNA fragments were determined and showed similarities to spotted fever group rickettsiae. Although their pathogenicity for animals including humans is still unclear, it is important to stay alert and pay attention to tick-borne diseases in order to ensure the safety of the citizens of the city as well as that of visitors.

39a1163f47ecb0d167b9e051ebc69814bb7676ea	The manuscript describes an important emerging technology (Nanotrap particle capture) for the diagnosis of important BSL3 viral pathogens. This method offers the potential of improved sensitivity and specificity of virus particle concentration in complex body fluids that is likely to have broad applicability in viral diagnostics. Detection of early infectious disease may be challenging due to the low copy number of organisms present. To overcome this limitation and rapidly measure low concentrations of the pathogen, we developed a novel technology: Nanotrap particles, which are designed to capture, concentrate, and protect biomarkers from complex biofluids. Nanotrap particles are thermoresponsive hydrogels that are capable of antigen capture through the coupling of affinity baits to the particles. Here, we describe recent findings demonstrating that Nanotrap particles are able to capture live infectious virus, viral RNA, and viral proteins. Capture is possible even in complex mixtures such as serum and allows the concentration and protection of these analytes, providing increased performance of downstream assays. The Nanotrap particles are a versatile sample preparation technology that has far reaching implications for biomarker discovery and diagnostic assays.
789a0e42916a7a3def358f13234df2c6ebeb8c0e	Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is one of the major causes of reproductive pig disease. Due to its serious nature, wide spread and consequent great damage to the swine industry, an effective, rapid and convenient method for its detection is needed. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect PPV infection. Two pairs of primers were specifically designed to recognize the six different sequences of open reading frame1 (ORF1) gene. The optimized LAMP program was as follows: 50 min at 59°C followed by 3 min at 80°C.The amplified products were analyzed both by visual inspection after staining with SYBR Green I dye and by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. Both methods showed the same sensitivity. The limit of detection (LOD) for PPV by LAMP was 10 copies, which is 100-fold lower than conventional PCR. Our LAMP assay did not cross-react with other viruses. We used the established LAMP system to test 1100 field samples and detected 660 positives. The LAMP detection method for PPV represents a visual, sensitive and rapid assay which can detect the virus in the field, offering an attractive alternative for the PPV detection methods currently in use.
46ce464dacc73edc9d0d1d712cb442474a2120b2	Twenty-four field isolates of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were isolated and examined for antigenic and biological characteristics. Most TGEV isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) in swine testis (ST) cell culture, which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected ceils from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident. Minor variations in CPE were observed with one isolate, IA-145. Protein profiles of the TGEV isolates as determined by SDS-PAGE were essentially identical, with the exception of the isolate IA-101. The TGEV isolate IA-101 presented a higher molecular mass M protein and lacked an N protein doublet that was present in all other TGEV isolates. The TGEV isolates were shown to be closely related antigenically by using hyperimmune sera in a virus neutralization (VN) test. Some antigenic diversity was detected by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a VN test. Titers of the mAbs were highest with the homologous Miller TGEV, and one virus isolate, IA-156, was very poorly neutralized with the mAbs used in this study. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results were similar to those obtained by the VN test. These studies show that some biologic and antigenic diversity exists among TGEV isolates.
ad790c4948a1a7bb32754b5cf67158bdc0ff8907	Viruses of lower vertebrates recently became a ®eld of interest to the public due to increasing epizootics and economic losses of poikilothermic animals. These were reported worldwide from both wildlife and collections of aquatic poikilothermic animals. Several RNA and DNA viruses infecting ®sh, amphibians and reptiles have been studied intensively during the last 20 years. Many of these viruses induce diseases resulting in important economic losses of lower vertebrates, especially in ®sh aquaculture. In addition, some of the DNA viruses seem to be emerging pathogens involved in the worldwide decline in wildlife. 3 Irido-, herpes-and polyomavirus infections may be involved in the reduction in the numbers of endangered amphibian and reptile species. In this context the knowledge of several important RNA viruses such as orthomyxo-, paramyxo-, rhabdo-, retro-, corona-, calici-, toga-, picorna-, noda-, reo-and birnaviruses, and DNA viruses such as parvo-, irido-, herpes-, adeno-, polyoma-and poxviruses, is described in this review.
793e3bce5456a4507004f70541ee5a3d604ca8ce	SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency. 1 Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. 2 Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3'fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anticoronavirus agents. The recent appearance of a new coronaviral infection, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, and its worldwide spread, has made international headlines. Already more than 3,000 deaths have been ascribed to this virus, and COVID-19 has reached near pandemic status. The virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia, sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy. 1 The virus, designated SARS-CoV-2, is a new member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, but is distinct from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 1 The coronaviruses are single strand RNA viruses, sharing properties with other single-stranded RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile virus, Marburg virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses. In particular, coronaviruses and HCV are both positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, 3,4 and thus have a similar replication mechanism requiring a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The coronavirus life cycle has been described. 3 Briefly, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis, is uncoated, and ORF1a and ORF1b of the positive strand RNA is translated to produce nonstructural protein precursors, including a cysteine protease and a serine protease; these further cleave the precursors to form mature, functional helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A replication-transcription complex is then
23e1bfb13e7ba21c876bd7ed1de2f6b6770f1490	Proteolytical cleavage of the picornaviral polyprotein is essential for viral replication. Therefore, viral proteases are attractive targets for anti-viral therapy. Most assays available for testing proteolytical activity of proteases are performed in vitro, using heterologously expressed proteases and peptide substrates. To deal with the disadvantages associated with in vitro assays, we modified a cell-based protease assay for picornavirus proteases. The assay is based on the induction of expression of a firefly luciferase reporter by a chimeric transcription factor in which the viral protease and cleavage sites are inserted between the GAL4 binding domain and the VP16 activation domain. Firefly luciferase expression is dependent on cleavage of the transcription factor by the viral protease. This biosafe assay enables testing the effect of compounds on protease activity in cells while circumventing the need for infection. We designed the assay for 3C proteases (3C pro ) of various enteroviruses as well as of viruses of several other picornavirus genera, and show that the assay is amenable for use in a high-throughput setting. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of activity of 3C pro inhibitor AG7088 (rupintrivir) not only encompasses enterovirus 3C pro but also 3C pro of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), an aphthovirus. In contrary, AG7404 (compound 1), an analogue of AG7088, had no effect on FMDV 3C pro activity, for which we provide a structural explanation.
75ec80cae8e8cd9b8e23dcdae389573551909435	This review is an attempt to retrace the chronicle that starts from the discovery of the role of nickel as the essential metal ion in urease for the enzymatic catalysis of urea, a key step in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen on Earth, to the most recent progress in understanding the chemistry of this historical enzyme. Data and facts are presented through the magnifying lenses of the authors, using their best judgment to filter and elaborate on the many facets of the research carried out on this metalloenzyme over the years. The tale is divided in chapters that discuss and describe the results obtained in the subsequent leaps in the knowledge that led from the discovery of a biological role for Ni to the most recent advancements in the comprehension of the relationship between the structure and function of urease. This review is intended not only to focus on the bioinorganic chemistry of this beautiful metal-based catalysis, but also, and maybe primarily, to evoke inspiration and motivation to further explore the realm of bio-based coordination chemistry.

7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631	a b s t r a c t PRRSV is the causative agent of the most important infectious disease affecting swine herds worldwide, producing great economic losses. Commercially available vaccines are only partially effective in protection against PRRSV. Moreover, modified live vaccines may allow virus shedding, and could revert generating virulent phenotypes. Therefore, new efficient vaccines are required. Vaccines based on recombinant virus genomes (virus vectored vaccines) against PRRSV could represent a safe alternative for the generation of modified live vaccines. In this paper, current vectored vaccines to protect against PRRSV are revised, including those based on pseudorabies virus, poxvirus, adenovirus, and virus replicons. Special attention has been provided to the use of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as vector for the expression of PRRSV antigens. This vector has the capability of expressing high levels of heterologous genes, is a potent interferon-␣ inducer, and presents antigens in mucosal surfaces, eliciting both secretory and systemic immunity. A TGEV derived vector (rTGEV) was generated, expressing PRRSV wild type or modified GP5 and M proteins, described as the main inducers of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response, respectively. Protection experiments showed that vaccinated animals developed a faster and stronger humoral immune response than the non-vaccinated ones. Partial protection in challenged animals was observed, as vaccinated pigs showed decreased lung damage when compared with the non-vaccinated ones. Nevertheless, the level of neutralizing antibodies was low, what may explain the limited protection observed. Several strategies are proposed to improve current rTGEV vectors expressing PRRSV antigens.
e2527e68c18b749ffb8266210a11da8ba68f915d	Antisense antimicrobial therapeutics are synthetic oligomers that silence expression of specific genes. This specificity confers an advantage over broad-spectrum antibiotics by avoiding unintended effects on commensal bacteria. The sequence-specificity and short length of antisense antimicrobials also pose little risk to human gene expression. Because antisense antimicrobials are a platform technology, they can be rapidly designed and synthesized to target almost any microbe. This reduces drug discovery time, and provides flexibility and a rational approach to drug development. Recent work has shown that antisense technology has the potential to address the antibiotic-resistance crisis, since resistance mechanisms for standard antibiotics apparently have no effect on antisense antimicrobials. Here, we describe current reports of antisense antimicrobials targeted against viruses, parasites, and bacteria.
818a918df0ea080de66936a5cabca0bb396f5209	Using a standard cellular fusion technique and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a hybridoma cell line strain secreting anti-HBs monoclonal antibody (mAb) (defined G6 mAb) was obtained. The cells grew and secreted mAb stably. Antibody titers in the culture supernatant and ascites were 2.048 Â10 6 and 4.096 Â10 6 , respectively. By applying the anti-HBs G6 mAb and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-HBs antibody, we developed a sandwich ELISA (defined G6m ELISA) for detecting both wild-type and immune escape mutant HBsAgs (IEM HBsAg). The assay was performed to detect 17 species of genome recombinant expression HBsAg, including two wild-type species and 15 IEM HBsAg species, which varied in the "a" determinant, in a group of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The patients previously had a lower ELISA detection signal [(absorbance of patients/absorbance of normal people (P/N): 1.0-4.5)]. The results demonstrated that the sensitivity of this assay to wild-type HBsAg was no less than 0.125 μg/L; 12 of 15 IEM HBsAg species (P/N≥2.5) were positive for G6 mAb. Of the positive IEM HBsAg species, two had a low absorbance value at 450 nm (A 450 ), one had an intermediate A 450 value and nine had a high A 450 value, which was 7.55%(mean), 59.4% and 92.1%-109.4% of the wild-type A 450 value, respectively. The two species with low A 450 value and the three negative species mutated at the bases 120-124 in the first loop of the HBV "a" determinant. Using the G6 ELISA and two commercial ELISA kits (A and B), 177 patients were tested. The G6 ELISA had a significantly higher detection rate than either commercial ELISAs (19.21% vs 14.89% and 6.21%, respectively; P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively).
859d6a0393eec883ce07d59c63c0ff3ffad1e6d4	Background: Measles is a highly infectious viral disease. In August 2017, Lyantonde District, Uganda reported a measles outbreak to Uganda Ministry of Health. We investigated the outbreak to assess the scope, factors facilitating transmission, and recommend control measures. Methods: We defined a probable case as sudden onset of fever and generalized rash in a resident of Lyantonde, Lwengo, or Rakai Districts from 1 June-30 September 2017, plus ≥1 of the following: coryza, conjunctivitis, or cough. A confirmed case was a probable case with serum positivity of measles-specific IgM. We conducted a neighborhood-and age-matched case-control study to identified exposure factors, and used conditional logistic regression to analyze the data. We estimated vaccine effectiveness and vaccination coverage. Results: We identified 81 cases (75 probable, 6 confirmed); 4 patients (4.9%) died. In the case-control study, 47% of case-patients and 2.3% of controls were hospitalized at Lyantonde Hospital pediatric department for non-measles conditions 7-21 days before case-patient's onset (OR adj = 34, 95%CI: 5.1-225). Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 95% (95%CI: 75-99%) and vaccination coverage was 76% (95%CI: 68-82%). During the outbreak, an "isolation" ward was established inside the general pediatric ward where there was mixing of both measles and non-measles patients. Conclusions: This outbreak was amplified by nosocomial transmission and facilitated by low vaccination coverage. We recommended moving the isolation ward outside of the building, supplemental vaccination, and vaccinating pediatric patients during measles outbreaks.
22835e6fe9a027b7efa00b555fec9092105f841a	Background: Many US hospitals lack the capacity to house safely a surge of potentially infectious patients, increasing the risk of secondary transmission. Respiratory protection and negative-pressure rooms are needed to prevent transmission of airbornespread diseases, but US hospitals lack available and/or properly functioning negative-pressure rooms. Creating new rooms or retrofitting existing facilities is time-consuming and expensive. Methods: Safe methods of managing patients with airborne-spread diseases and establishing temporary negative-pressure and/or protective environments were determined by a literature review. Relevant data were analyzed and synthesized to generate a response algorithm. Results: Ideal patient management and placement guidelines, including instructions for choosing respiratory protection and creating temporary negative-pressure or other protective environments, were delineated. Findings were summarized in a treatment algorithm. Conclusion: The threat of bioterrorism and emerging infections increases health care's need for negative-pressure and/or protective environments. The algorithm outlines appropriate response steps to decrease transmission risk until an ideal protective environment can be utilized. Using this algorithm will prepare infection control professionals to respond more effectively during a surge of potentially infectious patients following a bioterrorism attack or emerging infectious disease outbreak.

20c5f4025a94ca3a48d6d8a23a9db2ebc8b5ec03	Background Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants. Biomarkers of disease severity might help in clinical management. Objective To determine the clinical predictiveness of NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7, and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio in bronchiolitis. Methods Previously healthy children less than 24 months of age with bronchiolitis were recruited from the Texas Children's emergency room and intensive care unit from October 2010 to April 2011. Demographic, clinical information, and NW samples were obtained at enrollment. NW samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses, caspase 3/7, and LDH. Results A viral pathogen was detected in 91Á6% of 131 children, with the most common being respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus. A single infection was found in 61Á8% of subjects and co-infection in 29Á8%. Children admitted to ICU had significantly higher NW-LDH than children sent home from the ER or admitted to the general floor (P = 0Á02). Children infected with RSV had the highest NW-LDH concentration (P = 0Á03) compared with other viral infections. NW-LDH and NW-caspase were significantly correlated (r = 0Á77, P < 0Á0001). The univariate models showed NW-LDH and NW-LDH/NW-caspase 3/7 ratio were directly associated with hospitalization. Mutivariate regression analyses suggested a complex interaction between the biomarkers, demographics, and disposition. Conclusions NW-LDH, NW-caspase 3/7 and NW-LDH/NWcaspase 3/7 ratio and their interactions with demographic factors are predictive of bronchiolitis severity and can help distinguish children requiring ICU-level care from those admitted to the general floor, or discharged home from the emergency center. Keywords Bronchiolitis, caspase, disease severity, lactate dehydrogenase. Please cite this paper as: Mehta et al. (2014) Lactate dehydrogenase and caspase activity in nasopharyngeal secretions are predictors of bronchiolitis severity.
fa9c04042eb022318e0b33c2107240768f47eab8	As of June 10th 2020 about 7.2 million individuals have tested positive for, and more than 410,000 have died due to . In this review we outline the pathophysiology that underpins the potential use of anti-rheumatic therapies for severe COVID-19 infection and summarize the current evidence regarding the risk and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Thus far there is no convincing evidence that any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (conventional synthetic, biologic or targeted synthetic) including hydroxychloroquine, may protect against severe COVID-19 infection; answers about their possible usefulness in the management of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-9 infection will only arise from ongoing randomized controlled trials. Evidence on COVID-19 risk and outcome in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases is extremely limited; thus, any conclusions would be unsafe and should be seen with great caution. At present, the risk and severity (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and death) of COVID-19 infection in people with autoimmune diseases do not appear particularly dissimilar to the general population, with the possible exception of hospitalization in patients exposed to high glucocorticoid doses. At this stage it is impossible to draw any conclusions for differences in COVID-19 risk and outcome between different autoimmune diseases and between the various immunomodulatory therapies used for them. More research in the field is obviously required, including as a minimum careful and systematic epidemiology and appropriately controlled clinical trials.
61c89f680da08c45e908d33555a5701cadb4c1c6	Plato envisioned Earth's building blocks as cubes, a shape rarely found in nature. The solar system is littered, however, with distorted polyhedra -shards of rock and ice produced by ubiquitous fragmentation. We apply the theory of convex mosaics to show that the average geometry of natural 2D fragments, from mud cracks to Earth's tectonic plates, has two attractors: "Platonic" quadrangles and "Voronoi" hexagons. In 3D the Platonic attractor is dominant: remarkably, the average shape of natural rock fragments is cuboid. When viewed through the lens of convex mosaics, natural fragments are indeed geometric shadows of Plato's forms. Simulations show that generic binary breakup drives all mosaics toward the Platonic attractor, explaining the ubiquity of cuboid averages. Deviations from binary fracture produce more exotic patterns that are genetically linked to the formative stress field. We compute the universal pattern generator establishing this link, for 2D and 3D fragmentation. arXiv:1912.04628v1 [cond-mat.soft] 
d9cab1b533479ba4c2b8073371bae3a2b10c51b7	As recovery of congenital heart surgery programs begins during this COVID-19 pandemic, we review key considerations such as screening, protection of patients and health care workers (HCWs), case prioritization, barriers to reactivation, redesign of patient care teams, contribution of telemedicine, modification of trainees' experiences, preparation for potential resurgence, and strategies to maintain HCW wellness. COVID-19 has tested the resolve and grit of our specialty and we have an opportunity to emerge more refined.
32251b8dee5f9efe619e929534468964dc975fb7	Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is defined as physical or sexual violence, emotional abuse and stalking. It is typically experienced by women but can also be experienced by men. During quarantine due to the COVID-19, home risks to become a very dangerous place for victims of domestic violence. Method: Very recent studies focusing on abusive situations during COVID emergence were identified in PubMed/ Medline, Scopus, Embase. Results: During the COVID-19 outbreak people have encountered an invisible and dark enemy and an experience of impotence. Due to the feelings of frustration and agitation, aggression arises with possible transgenerational transmission of trauma and violence. Conclusions: Especially during quarantine and COVID emergence around the world there is a need of programs aimed to prevent acts of domestic violence and to achieve accurate assessment of multiple domains of abuse (psychological, physical, sexual) provided by trained multidisciplinary staffs (including psychiatrists, psychologists, social and legal services).
1aa2c31c6e5f358cf3ddc3977d6c2f81cf07f24b	Background: Electrospun (e-spun) nanofibers for wound dressing have attracted wide attention due to its large specific surface area, large porosity and breathability. Compared with solution electrospinning (e-spinning), melt e-spinning is more bio-friendly without toxic solvent participation, which provides the possibility of in situ e-spinning on wounds directly. However, previously reported melt e-spinning devices were usually bulky and cumbersome due to their necessary heating unit, and different components were separated to avoid electrostatic interference. In this article, we report on a self-powered hand-held melt e-spinning gun which can work without any external power supply (outdoors). The problem of electrostatic interference for this integrated device was solved by using a special high heat transfer insulation unit. The apparatus is easy and safe to operate by a single hand due to its small volume (24 × 6 × 13 cm 3 ) and light weight (about 450 g). Some biodegradable polymers, for example, polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were successful e-spun onto wounds directly by using this dressing gun. Conclusions: PCL fibrous membrane has good biocompatibility and can be in situ electrospun to wound surface as a wound dressing by the portable melt e-spinning gun. Besides wound dressing, this hand-held melt e-spinning gun may be used in 3D printing and experimental teaching demonstration aids.
90c1ab8b02263998f809915b0629da5aa1cbc47a	Background: It is now common for parents to measure tympanic temperatures in children. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these measurements. Parents and then nurses measured the temperature of 60 children with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use (home thermometer). The reference standard was a temperature measured by a nurse with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals (hospital thermometer). A difference of ≥ 0.5 °C was considered clinically significant. A fever was defined as a temperature ≥ 38.5 °C. The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent and the nurse with the home thermometer was 0.44 ± 0.61 °C, and 33% of the readings differed by ≥ 0.5 °C. The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent with the home thermometer and the nurse with the hospital thermometer was 0.51 ± 0.63 °C, and 72 % of the readings differed by ≥ 0.5 °C. Using the home thermometer, parents detected fever with a sensitivity of 76% (95% CI 50-93%), a specificity of 95% (95% CI 84-99%), a positive predictive value of 87% (95% CI 60-98%), and a negative predictive value of 91% (95% CI 79-98 %). In comparing the readings the nurse obtained from the two different tympanic thermometers, the mean absolute difference was 0.24 ± 0.22 °C. Nurses detected fever with a sensitivity of 94% (95 % CI 71-100 %), a specificity of 88% (95% CI 75-96 %), a positive predictive value of 76% (95% CI 53-92%), and a negative predictive value of 97% (95%CI 87-100 %) using the home thermometer. The intraclass correlation coefficient for the three sets of readings was 0.80, and the consistency of readings was not affected by the body temperature. The readings done by parents with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use differed a clinically significant amount from the reference standard (readings done by nurses with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals) the majority of the time, and parents failed to detect fever about one-quarter of the time. Tympanic readings reported by parents should be interpreted with great caution.
510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23	Rho GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs) have been reported to be of great importance in the initiation and development of many different cancers. However, their biological roles and regulatory mechanisms in lung cancer development and progression are poorly defined. Real-time PCR or western blotting analysis was used to detect Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24), WWP2, p27, p-STAT6 and STAT6 expression levels as well as the activity of RhoA and Rac1 in lung cancer. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis. Tumor growth of lung cancer cells was measured using a nude mouse xenograft experiment model in vivo. The correlation between WWP2 and p27 was measured by co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analysis. We found that ARHGAP24 expression was lower in lung cancer tissues collected from the The Cancer Genome Atlas and independent hospital database. Overexpression of ARHGAP24 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and the activity of RhoA and Rac1, induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at the G 0 -G 1 phase. ARHGAP24 overexpression also inhibited tumor growth in nude mice, whereas knockdown of ARHGAP24 significantly promoted cell proliferation and WWP2 expression and inhibited cell cycle arrest at G 1 phase through activating STAT6 signaling. ARHGAP24 overexpression inhibited WWP2 overexpression-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and the decreased p27 expression. Moreover, WWP2 was found interacted with p27, and WWP2 overexpression promoted the ubiquitination of p27. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ARHGAP24 inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induces cell apoptosis of lung cancer via a STAT6-WWP2-p27 axis.
a11d517c9cdd68c3671429751ed8420fb9fc1485	The hydroalcoholic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of Punica granatum leaves have been known to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of galloyl-hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-glucose isolated from pomegranate leaves on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. Male BALB/c mice were treated with different doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/Kg) or dexamethasone at 5 mg/Kg (per os) 6 h after intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after LPS challenge, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung samples were collected for analyses. They were evaluated by monitoring the expression of NF-κB, JNK, and cytokine genes and proteins, as well as cell migration and lung function. All doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose inhibited LPS-induced JNK and NF-κB activation. Likewise, the galloyl-HHDP-glucose-treated animals presented reduced expression of the TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β genes in the lungs and reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 protein levels when compared with the vehicle-treated LPS-challenged mice. In addition, the ALI mice treated with galloyl-HHDP-glucose also presented reduced lung inflammatory cell accumulation, especially that of neutrophils, in their BALF and lungs. In addition, Pinheiro et al. Galloyl-Hexahydroxydiphenoyl-Glucose Ameliorates Acute Lung Injury galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment markedly ameliorated the LPS-induced pulmonary mechanism complications and attenuated weight loss. Overall, we showed for the first time that galloyl-HHDP-glucose protects against ALI, and may be useful for treating ALI and other inflammatory disorders.
0a01f5cf1c5cdc2711bcef74315dc54a6e143df0	Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co-and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co-and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities. Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value < 0.01 (ROC values > 0.75 or < 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono-and co-infected subjects. Candidate diagnostic algorithms were created to distinguish between non-fibrotic and fibrotic individuals using a panel of 4 biomarker peaks.
4b2607f3da8bf06c231145105ffd5ca24a07bbda	Background: Health care associated infections (HAIs) are a source of concern worldwide. No health service in any country can be considered HAI risk-free. However, there is scarcity of data on the risks to which both patients and health workers are subject in non-hospital settings. The aim of this study was to identify issues that determine the adherence of professionals to precautions for preventing transmission of microorganisms in primary health care. Method: This was a qualitative study, using focus groups of primary health care staff, in two Brazilian municipalities. The data were analysed using content analysis. Results: Four focus groups were conducted with 20 professionals (11 community health workers, 5 nursing assistants and 4 nurses), and the analysed content was organized into four thematic categories. These categories are: low risk perception, weaknesses in knowledge, insufficient in-service training and infrastructure limitations. Participants expressed their weaknesses in knowledge of standard and transmission based precautions, mainly for hand hygiene and tuberculosis. A lack of appropriate resources and standardization in sharps disposal management was also highlighted by the participants. Conclusion: The study points out the need to provide in-service training for professionals on the transmission of microorganisms in primary health care to ensure adequate level of risk perception and knowledge. Further recommendations include investment to improve infrastructure to facilitate adherence to precautions and to minimize the risk of disease transmission for both patients and health care workers.
a08f5c095124c8c9b60c4103135ad06dc5511c6d	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus are common causes of infantile lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). It is widely believed that both viral replication and inappropriately enhanced immune responses contribute to disease severity. In infants, RSV LRTI is known to be more severe than influenza virus LRTI. Methods. We compared cytokines and chemokines in secretions of infants surviving various forms of respiratory illness caused by RSV or influenza viruses, to determine which mediators were associated with more-severe illness. We analyzed lung tissue from infants with fatal cases of RSV and influenza virus LRTI to determine the types of inflammatory cells present. Autopsy tissues were studied for the lymphotoxin granzyme and the apoptosis marker caspase 3. Results. Quantities of lymphocyte-derived cytokines were minimal in secretions from infants with RSV infection. Concentrations of most cytokines were greater in influenza virus, rather than RSV, infection. Lung tissues from infants with fatal RSV and influenza virus LRTI demonstrated an extensive presence of viral antigen and a near absence of CD8-positive lymphocytes and natural killer cells, with marked expression of markers of apoptosis. Conclusions. Severe infantile RSV and influenza virus LRTI is characterized by inadequate (rather than excessive) adaptive immune responses, robust viral replication, and apoptotic crisis. Infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent cause of hospitalization of infants in the United States [1, 2] . The pathogenesis of illness related to RSV infection is not well understood. Recent articles
4189a334c9f416a495245719ec23c13d2548fdc8	Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10 %. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 hours after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 µM at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented. Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects.
4aefa6ff9b51451e1b2094d230d8f737a6ba523a	Pulmonary diseases due to mycobacteria cause significant morbidity and mortality to human health. In addition to tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), recent epidemiological studies have shown the emergence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species in causing lung diseases in humans. Although more than 170 NTM species are present in various environmental niches, only a handful, primarily Mycobacterium avium complex and M. abscessus, have been implicated in pulmonary disease. While TB is transmitted through inhalation of aerosol droplets containing Mtb, generated by patients with symptomatic disease, NTM disease is mostly disseminated through aerosols originated from the environment. However, following inhalation, both Mtb and NTM are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in the lungs. Subsequently, various immune cells are recruited from the circulation to the site of infection, which leads to granuloma formation. Although the pathophysiology of TB and NTM diseases share several fundamental cellular and molecular events, the host-susceptibility to Mtb and NTM infections are different. Striking differences also exist in the disease presentation between TB and NTM cases. While NTM disease is primarily associated with bronchiectasis, this condition is rarely a predisposing factor for TB. Similarly, in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals, NTM disease presents as disseminated, extrapulmonary form rather than as a miliary, pulmonary disease, which is seen in Mtb infection. The diagnostic modalities for TB, including molecular diagnosis and drug-susceptibility testing (DST), are more advanced and possess a higher rate of sensitivity and specificity, compared to the tools available for NTM infections. In general, drugsensitive TB is effectively treated with a standard multi-drug regimen containing well-defined first-and second-line antibiotics. However, the treatment of drug-resistant TB requires the additional, newer class of antibiotics in combination with or without the first and second-line drugs. In contrast, the NTM species display significant heterogeneity in their susceptibility to standard anti-TB drugs. Thus, the treatment for NTM diseases usually involves the use of macrolides and injectable aminoglycosides. Although well-established international guidelines are available, treatment of NTM disease is mostly empirical and not entirely (Continued on next page)
7a24902df5f33494509943b8ff177bc01e4f2416	Infectious diseases are significant causes of human mortality, morbidity, and economic loss. Although effective antimicrobial agents are available for treating bacterial infections, as are limited agents for viral, fungal, and parasitic infections, many diseases are still very difficult to treat effectively and may present serious health concerns. The emergence of drug resistance among common pathogens continues to render ineffective many previously frontline therapies, and the use of many drugs is often limited by toxicity concerns. Emergence of diseases caused by new or drug-resistant pathogens demands more effective drugs. However, current advances in chemistry, bioinformatics, and structural biology should make it possible to discover or design novel anti-infective agents that target specific functions required for pathogen growth and pathogenesis (http://www3.niaid. nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/overview.htm). One major research goal of NIAID is to facilitate the discovery and evaluation of clinically effective drugs for a host of infectious diseases by supporting research at three levels: basic research and drug discovery; preclinical evaluation; and clinical evaluation (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/ meetings/anti infective mttg 2004.pdf), as follows: r Continue strong support of basic research, including focused emphasis on mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and microbial membrane biophysics. r Continue support for basic discovery research, including identification of targets and development of assays and diagnostic tools for more rapid, earlier detection of antimicrobial resistance. r Expand support for preclinical toxicology (e.g., in vitro toxicology, animal toxicology) and drug metabolism studies. r Continue strong support of genomic research, including analysis, proteomics capabilities, and protein structure. r Support the involvement of medicinal chemists and molecular biophysicists in research on anti-infective drugs. r Establish a prioritization process for allocating resources. Criteria could include public health priorities; feasibility of scientific and clinical research paths to product licensure; feasibility of product production; and feasibility of product distribution. r Support resources for developing models for pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic analysis and development of nonmurine animal models. r Provide resources for medicinal chemistry and formulation methodologies. Provide support for developing new statistical tools for analyzing clinical trial data. r Support the conduct of early-phase clinical trials, including pharmacokinetic studies in special populations, in low incidence diseases, or difficult indications. r Provide support for assessing the impact of the use of diagnostics on drug resistance. r Support development of improved methodologies, including statistical tools to allow more efficient use of clinical trial resources. r Establish collaborations with FDA and the pharmaceutical industry to evaluate possible alternative end points for prospective clinical trials. r Promote the evaluation of drugs not developed as antiinfectives for use as anti-infectives and discontinued candidates for potential niche indications. Recent Programmatic Accomplishments/Developments NIAID is continuing to support both in vitro and in vivo antiviral screening programs, preclinical evaluation of antiviral lead compounds, and clinical evaluation of antiviral drugs for medically important, emerging/re-emerging, and rare viral diseases.
37cf1eb9be84f2b178b4d60de7ba9520deccf453	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is the causative agent of a respiratory disease with a high case fatality rate. During the formation of the coronaviral replication/ transcription complex, essential steps include processing of the conserved polyprotein nsp7-10 region by the main protease M pro and subsequent complex formation of the released nsp's. Here, we analyzed processing of the coronavirus nsp7-10 region using native mass spectrometry showing consumption of substrate, rise and fall of intermediate products and complexation. Importantly, there is a clear order of cleavage efficiencies, which is influenced by the polyprotein tertiary structure. Furthermore, the predominant product is an nsp7+8(2 : 2) hetero-tetramer with nsp8 scaffold. In conclusion, native MS, opposed to other methods, can expose the processing dynamics of viral polyproteins and the landscape of protein interactions in one set of experiments. Thereby, new insights into protein interactions, essential for generation of viral progeny, were provided, with relevance for development of antivirals.
6a0f7cfb9306380e01f35d7f8c0e75c0f91dcbc4	Entry of the α-coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) requires specific proteases to activate spike (S) protein for the membrane fusion of the virion to the host cell following receptor binding. Herein, PEDV isolate 85-7 could proliferate and induce cell-cell fusion in a trypsin independent manner on Vero cells, and eight homologous mutation strains were screened by continuous proliferation in the absence of trypsin on Vero cells. According to the whole genome sequence comparative analysis, we identified four major variations located in nonstructural protein 2, S, open reading frame 3, and envelope (E) genes, respectively. Comparative analyses of their genomic variations and proliferation characteristics identified a single mutation within the S2′ cleavage site between C30 and C40 mutants: the substitution of conserved arginine (R) by a glycine (G) (R895G). This change resulted in weaker cell-cell fusion, smaller plaque morphology, higher virus titer and serious microfilament condensation. Further analysis confirmed that this mutation was responsible for optimal cell-adaptation, but not the determinant for trypsin-dependent entry of PEDV. Otherwise, a novel variation (16-20 aa deletion and an L25P mutation) in the transmembrane domain of the E protein affected multiple infection processes, including up-regulation of the production of the ER stress indicator GRP78, improving the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and promoting apoptosis. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the potential mechanisms of viral functional proteins in PEDV replication, infection, and fitness.
f149236453e2cb5a9f253f30f6d53fa9a506f640	20 SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is 21 replicated and transcribed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme (subunits 22 nsp7/nsp8 2 /nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One of these factors is the nsp13 23 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for 24 treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryo-electron microscopic structures of the 25 SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template-product in complex with two molecules of the 26 nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirus-order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with 27 the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12-thumb. The 28 structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the 29 replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function. We also observe 30 ADP-Mg 2+ bound in the nsp12 N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase 31 domain, detailing a new pocket for anti-viral therapeutic development. 32 33 35 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses belonging to order Nidovirales 36
b97de55ba907c3b1f3048bfecf6b2b3970363541	To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.
dea9e8dfd97e1140250cbde04aec315ceb3a2fa6	Background: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) are an important public health problem. Improved identification of risk factors might enable targeted intervention. Therefore we carried out a case-control study with the aim of identifying environmental risk factors for ARTI consultations in the Dutch general population. A subset of patients visiting their GP in the period of 2000-2003 with an ARTI (cases) and age-matched controls (visiting for other complaints) were included in a case-control study. They were asked to complete a questionnaire about potential risk factors. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio's (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to estimate the independent effect of potential risk factors. Results: A total of 493 matched pairs of case and control subjects were enrolled. Exposure to persons with respiratory complaints, both inside and outside the household, was found to be an independent risk factor for visiting a GP with an ARTI (respectively OR adj = 1.9 and OR adj = 3.7). Participants exposed to dampness or mould at home (OR adj =0.5) were significantly less likely to visit their GP. In accordance with the general risk of consultations for ARTI, participants with a laboratory-confirmed ARTI who were exposed to persons with respiratory complaints outside the household were also significantly more likely to visit their GP (OR adj =2.5). This study confirmed that heterogeneity in the general population as well as in pathogens causing ARTI makes it complicated to detect associations between potential risk factors and respiratory infections. Whereas it may be difficult to intervene on the risk posed by exposure to persons with respiratory complaints, transmission of ARTI in the general population might be reduced by improved hygienic conditions.
b730fd23fff5d5e824574744d118ed363c4404c1	Isolates of Escherichia coli which produce Vero cytotoxin (VTEC) were obtained during 1983-1989 from calves raised in 5 north-central states of the USA. All of the calves experienced intestinal epithelial colonization by VTEC, diarrhea or both; twelve of the calves had bloody diarrhea. Twenty one isolates were serogroup O111 and the others were O103, 069, 045, 026, 05, or non-typable (4 isolates ). All but one of the isolates hybridized with the CVD419 probe which identifies most VTEC strains. Thirty two isolates hybridized with the VTI probe, 3 with both the VT 1 and VT2 probes, and one with neither probe. The culture filtrate of the VT probe negative isolate was partially neutralized by SLT I monoclonal antibody. For the other isolates, the results of toxin neutralization by anti-SLT I and anti-SLT II monoclonal antibodies corresponded exactly with the VT 1 and VT2 probe hybridization results. Three of the strains adhered in a localized manner to HEp-2 cells and Intestine 407 cells.
5ffe9a1602b9c0959380eb15dfb78906ced112b4	In the age of a pandemic, such as the ongoing one caused by SARS-CoV-2, the world faces limited supply of tests, PPE and reagents, and factories are struggling to meet the growing demands. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pooling specimen for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten specimens were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimen of varying viral concentrations. Pooling specimens did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) between testing of pooling specimen and subsequent individual testing was not significantly different using paired t-test. This study also identified cost savings garnered from pooling of specimen for testing at 4 differing prevalence rates, ranging from 0.1-10%. Pooling specimens to test for COVID-19 infection in low prevalence areas or in low risk population can dramatically decrease the resources burden on lab operations by up to 80%. This paves the possibility for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with low incidence of infection, or with lower risk populations.
8e7e144a3c19ba3e020eae3a23b5d18a78bf1441	We employ deep learning to propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based and data stream guided real-time incremental learning algorithm for parameter estimation of a non-intrusive, intelligent, adaptive and online analytical model of Covid-19 disease. Modeling and simulation of such problems poses an additional challenge of continuously evolving training data in which the model parameters change over time depending upon external factors. Our main contribution is that in a scenario of continuously evolving training data, unlike typical deep learning techniques, this non-intrusive model eliminates the need to retrain or rebuild the model from scratch every time a new training data set is received. After validating the model, we use it to study the impact of different strategies for epidemic control. Finally, we propose and simulate a strategy of controlled natural immunization through risk based population compartmentalization (PC) wherein the population is divided in Low Risk (LR) and High Risk (HR) compartments based on risk factors (like comorbidities and age) and subjected to different disease transmission dynamics by isolating the HR compartment while allowing the LR compartment to develop natural immunity. Upon release from the preventive isolation, the HR compartment finds itself surrounded by enough number of immunized individuals to prevent spread of infection and thus most of the deaths occurring in this group are avoided.

56db819d134f2ac6be08e08951e376bd0c2bb464	Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections, hundreds of thousands of deaths and major societal disruption due to lockdowns and other restrictions introduced to limit disease spread. Relatively little attention has been paid to understanding how the pandemic has affected treatment, prevention and control of malaria, which is a major cause of death and disease and predominantly affects people in less well-resourced settings. Main body: Recent successes in malaria control and elimination have reduced the global malaria burden, but these gains are fragile and progress has stalled in the past 5 years. Withdrawing successful interventions often results in rapid malaria resurgence, primarily threatening vulnerable young children and pregnant women. Malaria programmes are being affected in many ways by COVID-19. For prevention of malaria, insecticide-treated nets need regular renewal, but distribution campaigns have been delayed or cancelled. For detection and treatment of malaria, individuals may stop attending health facilities, out of fear of exposure to COVID-19, or because they cannot afford transport, and health care workers require additional resources to protect themselves from COVID-19. Supplies of diagnostics and drugs are being interrupted, which is compounded by production of substandard and falsified medicines and diagnostics. These disruptions are predicted to double the number of young African children dying of malaria in the coming year and may impact efforts to control the spread of drug resistance. Using examples from successful malaria control and elimination campaigns, we propose strategies to re-establish malaria control activities and maintain elimination efforts in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to be a long-term challenge. All sectors of society, including governments, donors, private sector and civil society organisations, have crucial roles to play to prevent malaria resurgence. Sparse resources must be allocated efficiently to ensure integrated health care systems that can sustain control activities against COVID-19 as well as malaria and other priority infectious diseases. Conclusion: As we deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that other major killers such as malaria are not ignored. History tells us that if we do, the consequences will be dire, particularly in vulnerable populations.
fc221d8af0a962a17778721217b1f9f914f353b4	The first imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in China recently occurred, allowing for the characterization of antibody titers in a series of the patient's sera using the following methods based on recombinant viral structural antigens: inactivated MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), recombinant MERS-CoV spike (S, or fragments of S) ELISA, nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA and MERS S pseudovirus particle-based neutralization test (ppNT). A longitudinal profile of the infection showed that seroconversion detected by ELISAs based on the recombinant extracellular domain, S, S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigens occurred as early as neutralizing antibodies were detected by the ppNT and earlier than antibodies were detected by the inactivated MERS-CoV and N-terminal domain (NTD) ELISAs. Antibodies detected by the NP ELISA occurred last. Strong correlations were found between the S1, RBD and NP ELISAs and the inactivated MERS-CoV ELISA. The S and RBD ELISAs were highly correlated with the commercial S1 ELISA. The S ELISA strongly correlated with the ppNT, although the MERS-CoV, S1, NTD and RBD ELISAs were also significantly correlated with the ppNT (Po0.001).
312a9761151e130b6e5990df0f8322aee0cfa7fc	Chest computed tomography (CT) is widely used for the management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 49 pneumonia because of its availability and rapidity 1-3 . The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests but these tests might not be available in an emergency setting and their results are not immediately available, contrary to CT. In addition to its role for early diagnosis, CT has a prognostic role by allowing visually evaluating the extent of COVID-19 lung abnormalities 4, 5 . The objective of this study is to address prediction of short-term outcomes, especially need for mechanical ventilation. In this multi-centric study, we propose an end-to-end artificial intelligence solution for automatic quantification and prognosis assessment by combining automatic CT delineation of lung disease meeting expert's performance and data-driven identification of biomarkers for its prognosis. AI-driven combination of variables with CT-based biomarkers offers perspectives for optimal patient management given the shortage of intensive care beds and ventilators 6, 7 .
26a314620b252a1807a484eeda589f025212f646	Animal modelling for infectious diseases is critical to understand the biology of the pathogens including viruses and to develop therapeutic strategies against it. Herein, we present the sequence homology and expression data analysis of proteins found in Drosophila melanogaster that are orthologous to human proteins, reported as components of SARS-CoV-2/Human interactome. The dataset enlists sequence homology, query coverage, domain conservation, OrthoMCL and Ensembl Genome Browser support of 326 proteins in D.melanogaster that are potentially orthologous to 417 human proteins reported for their direct physical interactions with 28 proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genome. Expression of these D.melanogaster orthologous genes in 26 anatomical positions are also plotted as heat maps in 27 sets, corresponding to the potential protein interactors for each viral protein. The data could be used to direct experiments and potentially predict their phenotypic and molecular outcome in order to dissect the biological roles and molecular functionality of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a convenient animal model system like D.melanogaster.
71fc7f789bf037701164bbbf0de529c8c6ecb998	This article presents a novel single-feed circularly polarized patch antenna for dual-band (2.6 and 3.4 GHz) applications. Details of the design procedure and design considerations of the proposed antenna are described. The novelties of the proposed antenna are counted by (i) a meaningful Jia-shaped patch used as the primary radiator; (ii) a 3D Lshaped feeding probe used to excite the stacked patches so that the near degenerate-modes are excited at the desired dual band; (iii) down-tilt beams achieved that are particularly suitable for wall-mount base-stations. The measured 3-dB axial-ratio bandwidths are 2.41-2.61 GHz and 3.25-3.42 GHz, where the maximum gains are recorded as 7.3 and 6.3 dBic, respectively. Methods for the adjustment of band ratio down to 1.18 are discussed. The overall antenna size is 100×100×12.8 mm 3 .
ec215f28bb3fa02d320fc7957be8e59657db7f34	The need for critical care, hemodynamic support, renal replacement therapy, and mechanical ventilation have emerged as key features of the SARS-nCoV-2 pandemic. The primary aim of this study was to determine the in-hospital mortality rate of mechanically ventilated patients. We also sought to determine the risk of in-hospital mortality by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and body mass index. We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the mortality rate among inpatient adults with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation in the Nuvance Health system between March 1, 2020 and July 17, 2020. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older, had a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, were admitted to hospitals within the Nuvance Health network (7 hospitals), and were on mechanical ventilation at any time during their inpatient stay. Overall mortality in our cohort of 304 patients was 53.3%. Multivariable logistic regression including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and BMI demonstrated patients over 71 years old had greater risk of mortality compared to patients ages 61-70, and females had half the risk compared to males. There was no significant difference in risk of mortality given race, ethnicity, or BMI. In adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care, advanced age (>71 years old) and male gender are associated with increased risk of mortality.

7236a1dfe6471dd707053f3a663074d3ddec004a	Smart technologies present numerous opportunities for enhancing mobile health care. However, some concerns regarding the viability of smart technology applications must be addressed. This study investigated these concerns by reviewing the current practices of smart technology applications to mobile health care. As a result, five factors critical to the applicability of a smart technology to mobile health care are identified, and the fuzzy geometric mean-fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FGM-FAHP) approach is proposed to assess the relative importance levels of the identified factors. The experimental results showed that the three most critical factors identified include: (a) the relaxation of the related medical laws; (b) unobtrusiveness; and (c) the precise need and situation of a user. Accordingly, approximately 44%, 26%, and 15% of the budget should be allocated to the realization of the three critical factors, respectively. In addition, the challenges involved and opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of existing applications are discussed.

As the world's largest and irrevocable annual transnational religious movement, the Hajj and its connection with health security concerns have caught attention since the ancient times, because a huge population from all over the world gathers in the holy city of Mecca, which has tropical arid climate. Currently, the international community and international organizations are implementing multilevel governance with respect to the health security issues of the Hajj. Relevant agencies include the World Health Organization and its regional branches, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (ICRC), the Ministry of Hajj as well as the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, and the public health sectors/agencies in various countries that are involved with Hajj activities. The international community has successfully held the Hajj events, even when facing the challenges brought by some viral respiratory diseases such as SARS and MERS. The Hajj has become a rare opportunity for all stakeholders to improve their capabilities in international health security governance.

112a52667f92d8936fababa4b0c9001d3686b043	The epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now is spreading worldwide. The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan.
1d0822862f16cbd3f7b73f03648e761df1b7d054	Previously, we demonstrated that the DE072 strain of IBV is a recombinant which has an IBV strain D1466-like sequence in the S gene. Herein, we analyzed the remaining 3.8 kb 3 end of the genome, which includes Gene 3, Gene 4, Gene 5, Gene 6, and the 3 non-coding region of the DE072 and D1466 strains. Those two viruses had high nucleotide similarity in Gene 4. However, the other individual genes had a much different level of sequence similarity with the same gene of the other IBV strains. The genome of five IBV strains, of which the complete sequence of the 3 end of the genome has been determined, were divided at an intergenic (IG) consensus sequence (CTGAACAA or CTTAACAA) and compared phylogenetically. Phylogenetic trees of different topology indicated that the consensus IG sequences and the highly conserved sequence around this regions may serve as recombination 'hot spots'. Phylogenetic analysis of selected regions of the genome of the DE072 serotype field isolates further support those results and indicate that isolates within the same serotype may have different amounts of nucleotide sequence similarity with each other in individual genes other than the S gene. Presumably this occurs because the consensus IG sequence serves as the template switching site for the viral encoded polymerase.
6dccfa342b218c6dbe68ead6131d72369aa6e467	The Forkhead box, subclass O (FOXO) proteins are critical transcription factors, ubiquitously expressed in the human body. These proteins are characterized by a remarkable functional diversity, being involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, oxidative detoxification, DNA damage repair, stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, cell metabolism, angiogenesis, cardiac development, aging and others. In addition, FOXO have critical implications in both normal and cancer stem cell biology. New strategies to modulate FOXO expression and activity may now be developed since the discovery of novel FOXO regulators and non-coding RNAs (such as microRNAs) targeting FOXO transcription factors. This review focuses on physiological and pathological functions of FOXO proteins and on their action as fine regulators of cell fate and context-dependent cell decisions. A better understanding of the structure and critical functions of FOXO transcription factors and tumor suppressors may contribute to the development of novel therapies for cancer and other diseases.
a69e175ff426a2a483aad1f4cb066af413dd74bd	Recent demonstration of ACE2 and TMPRSSs expressions, both necessary for entry of the virus into the host cells, in human epidermis suggests that skin might be a cellular host and a potential transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 , especially in skin fragility conditions 1 . Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a skin fragility disorder caused by mutations in genes expressed in the cutaneous basement membrane zone 2, 3 . While an International consensus panel recently provided recommendations for prevention and multidisciplinary care of EB patients during the COVID-19 pandemic 4 , the phenotypic outcome in these patients in comparison to the general population has not been reported; however EB patients, particularly those with syndromic forms, may be at higher risk for infection with severe complications 4, 5 . Here, we reported three EB patients infected by COVID-19 during this pandemic. Family 1: Two female siblings from a family with four EB patients were referred for COVID-19 ( Figure 1a ). The phenotype of the patients was compatible with severegeneralized recessive dystrophic EB with a variant in COL7A1: NM_000094.3: c.6091G>A, p.Gly2031Ser disclosed by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1b , d) 6 . This family had a party attended by two children with common cold symptoms. After a week, these siblings experienced intermittent fever, dry cough, and myalgia with positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. The symptoms of the younger 32-year-old sister were mild; during subsequent two weeks of home-quarantine her general condition improved. However, the 35-year-old sister was hospitalized following exacerbation of symptoms including severe shortness of breath. The vital signs include temperature 38.3°C, the respiratory rate 24/min This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. and oxygen saturation with oxygen mask 92%. Low-dose spiral chest CT revealed large areas of ground-glass opacities compatible with COVID-19 (Figure 1c) . The patient was treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine. Her symptoms resolved after eight days of admission. Family 2: The third patient, affected by syndromic type of EB simplex with a homozygous donor splice site mutation in CD151: NM_004357.5: c.351+2T>C, was a 35year-old male who experienced low-grade fever, pleuritic chest pain, myalgia, and dry cough (Figure 1e-g) 7 . This mutation was disclosed by gene-targeted next-generation sequencing panel for EB 8 . He initially adhered to most recommendations of isolation; however, he worked as a construction worker and experienced mild signs of infection. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Since his symptoms were mild, homequarantine was recommended. After one week, his symptoms were resolved without any specific treatment. Patients with chronic diseases such as EB, may face health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic 9 . It has been suggested that disrupted epidermal barrier may provide an entry route for SARS-CoV-2 10 . At the same time, compliance to WHO hand hygiene protocols could be challenging for EB patients due to erosions on their hands. Recommendations for EB patients in the COVID-19 pandemic emphasize the use of mild hand cleansers that do not exacerbate the skin conditions along with frequent application of petrolatum-based emollients; the EB patients should also replace their outer layer of the dressings or bandages frequently. Importantly, their family members should follow all the precautions to avoid virus transmission to the patients 4, 5 . This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Our patients did not experience a severe course of COVID-19 despite some EB related complications, including severe anemia, esophageal strictures and growth retardation; in addition, one of the kidneys of the third patient was non-functional. Two patients experienced transient symptoms while in home-quarantine, and the third one required hospitalization. Thus, the severity of the COVID-19 in these EB patients was in the spectrum experienced by the general population. However, further clinical studies are required to investigate the prevalence and course of COVID-19 in EB patients.

The analytic and simulation results predicted by the model are presented and discussed. The simulations show that using the variant coefficients results in a higher percentage of susceptible individuals and a lower percentage of removed individuals. When the noise is included in the model, the percentage of infected individuals has a wider peak and more fluctuations than that predicted using the traditional SIR model. epidemic process, SIR model, white noise, variant coefficients Gu J, Gao Z M, Li W.

607af79ca36e85e13fe1410560c514803d5a2195	Cyber-harassment victimization is one of today's major problems affecting the wellbeing of youth, particularly those that identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual and gender nonconforming (LGBTQIA+). This exploratory study aims to determine the nature of cyber-harassment victimization, its enablers, and the coping mechanisms that online platforms provide to prevent or stop cyber-harassment. An online survey of ninety (n = 90) LGBTQIA+ young adults of ages between 18 and 34 from South Africa reveals a high incidence of exclusion, outing and harassment, covering a wide variety of types, duration and experienced severity, taking place through text messaging and social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Most LGBTQIA+ youth resort to measures such as blocking, deleting offensive content and adjusting privacy settings to cope with cyber-victimization. Worryingly, the most severe effects of harassment such as depression, drug abuse, self-harm and suicide contemplation, have significant correlations with the harassment type used, harassment duration and harassment frequency. The paper discusses the implications for educational and social practice and future studies.
2e4e028545dfdf378169bab94dd081042bcdcfc3	An ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia was caused by a novel coronavirus in China in 2019. By March 19, over 200 thousand confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and over 9000 deaths have been reported throughout the world. For this infectious disease, nucleic acid detection is still the gold standard for pathogenic detection. However, nucleic acid detection takes a long time and has relatively high "false negative"; therefore, we need urgently a convenient and accurate detection method to make up for this deficiency. In this article, we will show such technical characteristics of lgM/lgG serum antibody detection, compared with nucleic acid detection. SARS-CoV-2, lgM/lgG antibody detection, novel coronavirus
5a09fda591e2442993ba9663cf16e1471671d978	Given a Boolean formula ϕ, the problem of model counting, also referred to as #SAT, is to compute the number of solutions of ϕ. The hashing-based techniques for approximate counting have emerged as a dominant approach, promising achievement of both scalability and rigorous theoretical guarantees. The standard construction of strongly 2universal hash functions employs dense XORs (i.e., involving half of the variables in expectation), which is widely known to cause degradation in the runtime performance of state of the art SAT solvers. Consequently, the past few years have witnessed an intense activity in the design of sparse XORs as hash functions. Such constructions have been proposed with beliefs to provide runtime performance improvement along with theoretical guarantees similar to that of dense XORs. The primary contribution of this paper is a rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis to understand the effect of the sparsity of XORs. In contradiction to prior beliefs of applicability of analysis for sparse hash functions to all the hashing-based techniques, we prove a contradictory result. We show that the best-known bounds obtained for sparse XORs are still too weak to yield theoretical guarantees for a large class of hashing-based techniques, including the state of the art approach ApproxMC3. We then turn to a rigorous empirical analysis of the performance benefits of sparse hash functions. To this end, we first design, to the best of our knowledge, the most efficient algorithm called SparseCount2 using sparse hash functions, which achieves at least up to two orders of magnitude performance improvement over its predecessor. Contradicting the current beliefs, we observe that SparseCount2 still falls short of ApproxMC3 in runtime performance despite the usage of dense XORs in ApproxMC3. In conclusion, our work showcases that the question of whether it is possible to use short XORs to achieve scalability while providing strong theoretical guarantees is still wide open.
f470c2e661e7f2be45253a47469ee86c55e9de3d	Over a period of 2 months, 35 of 69 (51%) cases of juvenile diarrhoea studied in eastern Malaysia were associated with rotavirus excretion; rotavirus associated diarrhoea occurred most commonly in the 6-24 month age group. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of genome ribonucleic acid showed that only 4 rotavirus electropherotypes could be detected. Of those, 2 predominated and 2 were detected only once each; one of these may have been a reassortment of the two predominant electropherotypes. Analysis of the clinical features of patients excreting rotavirus subgroup 1 or 2, determined by PAGE, demonstrated that rotavirus subgroup 1 was associated with more hypotonic dehydration and need for intravenous therapy: lethargy was signi6cantly more common among those excreting rotavirus subgroup 2.
d13f5a5fa79315e120154fcac023f97ccfe8ad6f	Type I Interferons (IFNs) are hallmark cytokines produced in immune responses to all classes of pathogens. Type I IFNs can influence dendritic cell (DC) activation, maturation, migration, and survival, but also directly enhance natural killer (NK) and T/B cell activity, thus orchestrating various innate and adaptive immune effector functions. Therefore, type I IFNs have long been considered essential in the host defense against virus infections. More recently, it has become clear that depending on the type of virus and the course of infection, production of type I IFN can also lead to immunopathology or immunosuppression. Similarly, in bacterial infections type I IFN production is often associated with detrimental effects for the host. Although most cells in the body are thought to be able to produce type I IFN, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) have been termed the natural "IFN producing cells" due to their unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and ability to produce high amounts of type I IFN. Findings from mouse reporter strains and depletion experiments in in vivo infection models have brought new insights and established that the role of pDCs in type I IFN production in vivo is less important than assumed. Production of type I IFN, especially the early synthesized IFNβ, is rather realized by a variety of cell types and cannot be mainly attributed to pDCs. Indeed, the cell populations responsible for type I IFN production vary with the type of pathogen, its tissue tropism, and the route of infection. In this review, we summarize recent findings from in vivo models on the cellular source of type I IFN in different infectious settings, ranging from virus, bacteria, and fungi to eukaryotic parasites. The implications from these findings for the development of new vaccination and therapeutic designs targeting the respectively defined cell types are discussed.
501c5d126afc8f370cde39c613a23366f99983c7	GmcA is a FAD-containing enzyme belonging to the GMC (glucose-methanol-choline oxidase) family of oxidoreductases. A mutation in the Rhizobium leguminosarum gmcA gene was generated by homologous recombination. The mutation in gmcA did not affect the growth of R. leguminosarum, but it displayed decreased antioxidative capacity at H 2 O 2 conditions higher than 5 mM. The gmcA mutant strain displayed no difference of glutathione reductase activity, but significantly lower level of the glutathione peroxidase activity than the wild type. Although the gmcA mutant was able to induce the formation of nodules, the symbiotic ability was severely impaired, which led to an abnormal nodulation phenotype coupled to a 30% reduction in the nitrogen fixation capacity. The observation on ultrastructure of 4-week pea nodules showed that the mutant bacteroids tended to start senescence earlier and accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules. In addition, the gmcA mutant was severely impaired in rhizosphere colonization. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the gmcA gene expression was significantly up-regulated in all the detected stages of nodule development, and statistically significant decreases in the expression of the redoxin genes katG, katE, and ohrB were found in gmcA mutant bacteroids. LC-MS/MS analysis quantitative proteomics techniques were employed to compare differential gmcA mutant root bacteroids in response to the wild type infection. Sixty differentially expressed proteins were identified including 33 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated proteins. By sorting the identified proteins according to metabolic function, 15 proteins were transporter protein, 12 proteins were related to stress response and virulence, and 9 proteins were related to transcription factor activity. Moreover, nine proteins related to amino acid metabolism were over-expressed.

9845c90ec0549b8375f212141214dd57f89060a5	Human beings have experienced a serious public health event as the new pneumonia , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has killed more than 3000 people in China, most of them elderly or people with underlying chronic diseases or immunosuppressed states. Rapid assessment and early warning are essential for outbreak analysis in response to serious public health events. This paper reviews the current model analysis methods and conclusions from both micro and macro perspectives. The establishment of a comprehensive assessment model, and the use of model analysis prediction, is very efficient for the early warning of infectious diseases. This would significantly improve global surveillance capacity, particularly in developing regions, and improve basic training in infectious diseases and molecular epidemiology.
d43801d39a71e2f215acc9495dc5266c97bcb9e8	Complications of prematurity often disrupt normal brain development and/or cause direct damage to the developing brain, resulting in poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Physiologically relevant animal models of perinatal brain injury can advance our understanding of these influences and thereby provide opportunities to develop therapies and improve long-term outcomes. While there are advantages to currently available small animal models, there are also significant drawbacks that have limited translation of research findings to humans. Large animal models such as newborn pig, sheep and nonhuman primates have complex brain development more similar to humans, but these animals are expensive, and developmental testing of sheep and piglets is limited. Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are born lissencephalic and undergo postnatal cortical folding to form complex gyrencephalic brains. This review examines whether ferrets might provide a novel intermediate animal model of neonatal brain disease that has the benefit of a gyrified, altricial brain in a small animal. It summarizes attributes of ferret brain growth and development that make it an appealing animal in which to model perinatal brain injury. We postulate that because of their innate characteristics, ferrets have great potential in neonatal neurodevelopmental studies.
75e9aa9e6b55fd019cedf4d6944b29285807f564	The genetic diversity of 16 canine coronavirus (CCoV) samples is described. Samples were obtained from pups infected naturally living in different areas. Sequence data were obtained from the M gene and pol 1a and pol 1b regions. The phylogenetic relationships among these sequences and sequences published previously were determined. The canine samples segregated in two separate clusters. Samples of the first cluster were intermingled with reference strains of CCoV genotype and therefore could be assigned to this genotype. The second cluster segregated separately from CCoV and feline coronavirus genotypes and therefore these samples may represent genetic outliers. The reliability of the classification results was confirmed by repeating the phylogenetic analysis with nucleotide and amino acid sequences from multiple genomic regions. #
571e2d50bbfd13f3dc277ba771cfd635ff7d21f7	Kawasaki disease (KD) is a medium vessel vasculitis with predilection for coronary arteries. Due to lack of a reliable confirmatory laboratory test, the diagnosis of KD is based on a constellation of clinical findings that appear in a typical temporal sequence. These diagnostic criteria have been modified from time to time and the most recent guidelines have been proposed by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2017. However, several children may have incomplete or atypical forms of KD and the diagnosis can often be difficult, especially in infants and young children. In this review, we have detailed the steps involved in arriving at a diagnosis of KD and also highlight the important role of echocardiography in diagnosis and management of children with KD.
23620ceeefafccfc6107a477f1c24d1cfa0fafee	Intestinal immune response plays an important defensive role for pathogens, particularly for those transmitted by the oro-faecal route or for foecal shedding modulation. This work examined three parts of intestine from twelve gilts experimentally infected with PCV2spiked semen, six vaccinated (V group) and six unvaccinated (NV group) against PCV2, 29 and 53 days post infection (DPI). An immunohistochemical investigation for IgA-, IgGand IgM-antibody bearing plasma cells (PCs) was run on intestinal samples coupled with a sandwich immunohistochemical method to reveal anti-PCV2 antibody-secreting PCs. Plasma cell density was compared in the two groups of animals at 29 and 53 DPI. The IgA, IgG and IgM PC density did not differ between groups but displayed an increase from the upper (villus) to the lower part of the crypts while a decreasing trend in PC density was identified from duodenum to ileum. In the NV group, no increase in anti-PCV2 PC density was demonstrable in the two sampling moment: the amounts of lamina propria PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs remained constant, 10.55 ± 4.24 and 10.06 ± 5.01 at 29 DPI and 53 DPI, respectively. In the V group a significant increase in PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs was observed over time. The amounts of PCV2-specific antibodyproducing PCs increased from 9.37 ± 13.36 at 29 DPI to 18.76 ± 15.83 at 53 DPI. The data on IgA, IgM and IgG PC counts can be considered reference values in a population of adult pigs. The sandwich method can be proposed as a technique able to identify specific antibodysecreting PCs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. A practical application of the sandwich method is the demonstration of a "booster-like" response of the lamina propria in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals. After virus challenge, vaccination induced an increase in the number of PCs containing specific anti-PCV2 antibodies at the level of intestinal mucosa.
23e5dea36e05557e26f1035d015839cedf2503ba	Plasma exchange has proven to be effective in diseases of established or presumed autoimmune etiology as well as in hyperviscosity syndromes and some rare metabolic disorders. Its application is thought to be relatively safe; nevertheless, severe complications may occur. We therefore analyzed the complications of 291 exchanges in 39 patients with neurological diseases. Minor complications developed in 4.8% and major complications in 2.7% of procedures, including one death. Severe infections and technical problems have been the most serious side effects, sometimes followed by organ failure or even death.
5a1cb90a3095520c81ea18a08b9fb9572333e163	Group testing is a widely used protocol which aims to test a small group of people to identify whether at least one of them is infected. It is particularly efficient if the infection rate is low, because it only requires a single test if everybody in the group is negative. The most efficient use of group testing is a complex mathematical question. However, the answer highly depends on practical parameters and restrictions, which are partially ignored by the mathematical literature. This paper aims to offer practically efficient group testing algorithms, focusing on the current COVID-19 epidemic.
818c1fb383a8ddbc435cb2bd46e77d38b2dbf23e	Understanding the current research trends, problems, and their innovative solutions remains a bottleneck due to the ever-increasing volume of scientific articles. In this paper, we propose NLPExplorer, a completely automatic portal for indexing, searching, and visualizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) research volume. NLPExplorer presents interesting insights from papers, authors, venues, and topics. In contrast to previous topic modelling based approaches, we manually curate five course-grained non-exclusive topical categories namely Linguistic Target (Syntax, Discourse, etc.), Tasks (Tagging, Summarization, etc.), Approaches (unsupervised, supervised, etc.), Languages (English, Chinese, etc.) and Dataset types (news, clinical notes, etc.). Some of the novel features include a list of young popular authors, popular URLs and datasets, list of topically diverse papers and recent popular papers. Also, it provides temporal statistics such as yearwise popularity of topics, datasets, and seminal papers. To facilitate future research and system development, we make all the processed dataset accessible through API calls. The current system is available at http://nlpexplorer.org.
9b5f7347b52c46ad29b1991560e6251bfdfd8df2	Human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are common respiratory viruses associated with acute respiratory infection. They have a global distribution. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of HCoV infection is important for the management and treatment of hospitalized patients with HCoV infection. Here, we developed a melting curve-based multiplex RT-qPCR assay for simultaneous detection of the four HCoVs. In the assay, SYTO 9 was used to replace SYBR Green I as the fluorescent dye, and GC-modified primers were designed to improve the melting temperature (Tm) of the specific amplicon. The four HCoVs were clearly distinguished by characteristic melting peaks in melting curve analysis. The detection sensitivity of the assay was 3 × 10 2 copies for HCoV-OC43, and 3 × 10 1 copies for HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 per 30 µL reaction. Clinical evaluation and sequencing confirmation demonstrated that the assay was specific and reliable. The assay represents a sensitive and reliable method for diagnosis of HCoV infection in clinical samples.
52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8	Objectives The objectives were to collect baseline data on the occurrence, testing and vaccination practices, and clinical outcomes of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in New Zealand Methods A cross-sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in New Zealand was performed to collect data on FeLV and FIV testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year. Clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA at a first-opinion veterinary practice between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity. Survival times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results The survey was completed by 112 clinics (26.4%) of which 72 performed in-house testing. Of the 2125 tests performed, 56 (2.6%) were positive for FeLV and 393 (18.5%) were positive for FIV. Fewer than 1% of cats were vaccinated for FeLV, with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating. Being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both FeLV and FIV test positivity. The median survival times of FeLV and FIV test-positive cats were 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-16) and 650 days (95% CI 431-993), respectively. Conclusions and relevance Testing and vaccination for FeLV and FIV in New Zealand appears targeted towards high-risk animals, which may bias prevalence estimates. Baseline data should be monitored for changes in FeLV epidemiology now commercial vaccines are no longer available.
14e965008442acf421cac9d1610f26fe62c5ab69	Background and Objective Early management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D over early clinical outcome and serum cytokine levels in patients with moderate to severe brain injury. Methods Thirty-five patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the ICU unit were recruited into the study. Subjects were randomly allocated to a treatment regimen comprising either a one-time oral dose of 120,000 IU (two tablets of 60,000 IU each) of vitamin D (n = 20) or 8 mg of saccharide (two tablets of 4 g each) as placebo (n = 15). The main parameters evaluated included duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and cytokine levels (interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-2). The results indicated an improvement in the level of consciousness after 7 days in the vitamin D-treated group compared with placebo. An elevation in GCS score by 3.86 units in the vitamin D-treated group with a 0.19-unit descent in the control group was recorded. Duration of mechanical ventilation was reduced in the vitamin D-treated group compared with the control group (4.7 days vs. 8.2 days, p value 0.0001). A noticeable reduction was recorded in inflammatory biomarkers (cytokines) in the vitamin D-treated group (IL-6 p = 0.08, TNF-α p = 0.02, IL-2 p = 0.36) with notable elevation in IFN-γ (p = 0.65) compared to the control group. Conclusion In the acute phase of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin D supplementation plays a vital role and has a favourable effect on the consciousness level of patients.

fadb12b24dda1e1dc8edd450ff8c5fec6853edcc	This study was carried out in the district of Lapseki in Çanakkale, Turkey. The suitability of land in Lapseki for agriculture was evaluated by using an analytic hierarchy process. In the study, the basic parameters were determined by using the soil map and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data. Land use capability classes, soil depth, erosion risk and other soil properties (limiting factors) were obtained from the soil map, while slope, elevation and aspect were obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data. To determine the weight of the parameters in the analytic hierarchy process, the opinions of the public institutions and experts were obtained. The obtained data were analyzed with the analytic hierarchy process and mapped with geographic information systems techniques, and a land suitability map was generated. The agricultural land suitability map demonstrated that 2.95% (2557 ha) of the lands in the study area were highly suitable; 10.37% (8989 ha) were moderately suitable; 53.47% (46,336 ha) were marginally suitable; and 33.21% (28,775 ha) were not suitable for agricultural use. The data from the agricultural land suitability map were compared with the Coordination of Information on the Environment 2012 data. As a result of comparison, 14.12% (361 ha) of highly suitable lands for agriculture and 2.25% (202 ha) of moderate suitable lands for agriculture are urbanized. It was seen that 45.71% (24,837 ha) of the lands that are marginally suitable for agriculture and 18.76% (5397 ha) of the not suitable lands had current land use for agriculture.
78a8d488d2fa21bd3fedcd4534718376e9333406	Common cold viruses create significant health and financial burdens, and understanding key loci of transmission would help focus control strategies. This study (1) examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) or a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year, (2) investigates evidence for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission and the characteristics of individuals implicated in transmission, and (3) builds data-based simulation models to identify factors that most strongly affect patterns of prevalence. We detected HRV, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, influenza and bocavirus with the FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC). We used logistic regression to find covariates affecting acquisition or loss of HRV including demographic characteristics of individuals, their household, their current infection status, and prevalence within their household and across the population. We apply generalized linear mixed models to test robustness of results. Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus, and higher with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Loss of HRV is reduced with a higher proportion of other household members infected. Within households, only children and symptomatic individuals show evidence for transmission, while between households only a higher number of infected older children (ages 5-19) increases the probability of acquisition. Coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and bocavirus also show evidence of intrahousehold transmission. Simulations show that age-dependent susceptibility and transmission have the largest effects on mean HRV prevalence.
025931fab21cf63c99d33a3fc8e2818c1b6c86be	Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) enables detection and quantification of antigenspecific antibodies in biological samples such as human or animal sera. Most current MERS-CoV serological assays such as neutralization, immunofluorescence, or protein microarray rely on handling of live MERS-CoV in high containment laboratories, highly trained personnel as well as the need for expensive and special equipment and reagents representing a hurdle for most laboratories especially when resources are limited. In this chapter, we describe a validated and optimized indirect ELISA protocol based on recombinant S1 subunit (amino acids 1-725) of MERS-CoV for qualitative and quantitative determination of MERS-CoVbinding antibodies.
e8041691889938fa8e374b16167f56a0a01443b4	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global shortage of personal protective equipment. While existing supply chains are struggling to meet the surge in demand, the limited supply of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has placed healthcare workers at risk. This paper presents a method for scalable and distributed manufacturing of FFR filter material based on a combination of centrifugal melt spinning utilizing readily available cotton candy machines as an example. The proposed method produces nonwoven polypropylene fabric material with filtering efficiency of up to 96% for particles 0.30-0.49 µm in diameter. We additionally demonstrate a scalable means to test for filtration efficiency and pressure drop to ensure a standardized degree of quality in the output material. We perform preliminary optimization of relevant parameters for scale-up and propose that this is a viable method to rapidly produce up to one million N95 FFRs per day in distributed manner with just six machines per site operating across 200 locations. We share this work as a starting point for others to rapidly construct, replicate and develop their own affordable modular processes aimed at producing high quality filtration material to address the current FFR shortage globally. 1 At the time of writing, the CDC is actively maintaining a growing list of counterfeit N95 products. 2 There's limited publicly-available data on the electrostatic charges of commercial polymers, and the measurement process itself is quite involved.
185b7ddc439bc3490a0c97ecc00861497c6bd481	The essential requirement of the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) in the development and maintenance of peripheral lymphoid organs is well recognized. Evidence shows that LTβR is involved in various cellular processes; however, whether it plays a role in maintaining the cellular function of intestinal porcine enterocytes (IPEC-J2), specifically during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, remains unknown. In this study, we generated LTβR null IPEC-J2 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 to examine the importance of LTβR in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the response to PEDV infection. Our results showed that the lack of LTβR leads to significantly decreased cell proliferation, potentially due to S phase arrest in LTβR −/− IPEC-J2 cells. Label-free digital holographic microscopy was used to record the three-dimensional morphology of both cell types for up to 72 hours and revealed significantly increased numbers of LTβR −/− cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that PEDV-infected LTβR −/− null IPEC-J2 cells exhibited significant suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) target genes (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8) and mucosal barrier integrity-related genes (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and IL-22), which may explain why LTβR −/− cells are more susceptible to PEDV infection. Collectively, our data not only demonstrate the key role of LTβR in intestinal porcine enterocytes, but also provide data for the improved understanding of the cellular response to PEDV infection.
8baab20255839dfc49b9318ee0c3a8fcc0a744bf	Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignancy with high morbidity/mortality, partly due to a lack of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. It is important to develop reliable biomarker(s) with specificity, sensitivity and convenience for early diagnosis. The role of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and survival of GC patients are controversial. Macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) regulates monocytes/macrophages. Elevated MCSF is correlated with invasion, metastasis and poor survival of tumour patients. IL-34, a ligand of the M-CSF receptor, acts as a "twin" to M-CSF, demonstrating overlapping and complimentary actions. IL-34 involvement in tumours is controversial, possibly due to the levels of M-CSF receptors. While the IL-34/M-CSF/M-CSFR axis is very important for regulating macrophage differentiation, the specific interplay between these cytokines, macrophages and tumour development is unclear. A multi-factorial evaluation could provide more objective utility, particularly for either prediction and/ or prognosis of gastric cancer. Precision medicine requires molecular diagnosis to determine the specifically mutant function of tumours, and is becoming popular in the treatment of malignancy. Therefore, elucidating specific molecular signalling pathways in specific cancers facilitates the success of a precision medicine approach. Gastric cancer tissue arrays were generated from stomach samples with TNM stage, invasion depth and the demography of these patients (n = 185). Using immunohistochemistry/histopathology, M-CSF, IL-34 and macrophages were determined. We found that IL-34 may serve as a predictive biomarker, but not as an independent, prognostic factor in GC; M-CSF inversely correlated with survival of GC in TNM III-IV subtypes. Increased CD68 + TAMs were a good prognostic factor in some cases and could be used as an independent prognostic factor in male T3 stage GC. Our data support the potency of IL-34, M-CSF, TAMs and the combination of IL-34/TAMs as novel biological markers for GC, and may provide new insight for both diagnosis and cellular therapy of GC. © The Author(s) 2020.

9ffde004c991e9cf3c63e9143946a64ffaa9ee2a	Background: Thousands of different microorganisms affect the health, safety, and economic stability of populations. Many different medical and governmental organizations have created lists of the pathogenic microorganisms relevant to their missions; however, the nomenclature for biological agents on these lists and pathogens described in the literature is inexact. This ambiguity can be a significant block to effective communication among the diverse communities that must deal with epidemics or bioterrorist attacks. We have developed a database known as the Microbial Rosetta Stone. The database relates microorganism names, taxonomic classifications, diseases, specific detection and treatment protocols, and relevant literature. The database structure facilitates linkage to public genomic databases. This paper focuses on the information in the database for pathogens that impact global public health, emerging infectious organisms, and bioterrorist threat agents. The Microbial Rosetta Stone is available at http://www.microbialrosettastone.com/. The database provides public access to up-to-date taxonomic classifications of organisms that cause human diseases, improves the consistency of nomenclature in disease reporting, and provides useful links between different public genomic and public health databases.
7c7e058a7a630f3529a064cd3cce2fc70f246ff1	The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by an unprecedented amount of published scientific articles. The aim of this study is to assess the type of articles published during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare them with articles published during 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic. Two operators independently extracted and assessed all articles on COVID-19 and on H1N1 swine influenza that had an abstract and were indexed in PubMed during the first 3 months of these pandemics. Of the 2482 articles retrieved on COVID-19, 1165 were included. Over half of them were secondary articles (590, 50.6%). Common primary articles were: human medical research (340, 59.1%), in silico studies (182, 31.7%) and in vitro studies (26, 4.5%). Of the human medical research, the vast majority were observational studies and cases series, followed by single case reports and one randomized controlled trial. Secondary articles were mainly reviews, viewpoints and editorials (373, 63.2%). Limitations were reported in 42 out of 1165 abstracts (3.6%), with 10 abstracts reporting actual methodological limitations. In a similar timeframe, there were 223 articles published on the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a higher prevalence of reviews and guidance articles and a lower prevalence of in vitro and animal research studies compared with the H1N1 pandemic. In conclusions, compared to the H1N1 pandemic, the majority of early publications on COVID-19 does not provide new information, possibly diluting the original data published on this disease and consequently slowing down the development of a valid knowledge base on this disease. Also, only a negligible number of published articles reports limitations in the abstracts, hindering a rapid interpretation of their shortcomings. Researchers, peer reviewers, and editors should take action to flatten the curve of secondary articles.
aabc6724a4fae18bac4c79c492e24eb91747c73d	KEYWORDS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Exacerbations Pathogenesis Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are episodes of symptom worsening which have significant adverse consequences for patients. Highly heterogeneous events associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation and physiological changes. They are triggered predominantly by respiratory viruses and bacteria, which infect the lower airway and increase airway inflammation. A proportion of patients appear to be more susceptible to exacerbations, with poorer quality of life and more aggressive disease progression. Prevention and mitigation of exacerbations are therefore key goals of COPD management.
bc67c021d6e189215a0101f6e5de32daa8e4ccee	Background: Bats are reservoirs for a diverse range of coronaviruses (CoVs), including those closely related to human pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV. There are approximately 139 bat species reported to date in Thailand, of which two are endemic species. Due to the zoonotic potential of CoVs, standardized surveillance efforts to characterize viral diversity in wildlife are imperative. Findings: A total of 626 bats from 19 different bat species were individually sampled from 5 provinces in Eastern Thailand between 2008 and 2013 (84 fecal and 542 rectal swabs). Samples collected (either fresh feces or rectal swabs) were placed directly into RNA stabilization reagent, transported on ice within 24 hours and preserved at −80°C until further analysis. CoV RNA was detected in 47 specimens (7.6%), from 13 different bat species, using broadly reactive consensus PCR primers targeting the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase gene designed to detect all CoVs. Thirty seven alphacoronaviruses, nine lineage D betacoronaviruses, and one lineage B betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV related) were identified. Six new bat CoV reservoirs were identified in our study, namely Cynopterus sphinx, Taphozous melanopogon, Hipposideros lekaguli, Rhinolophus shameli, Scotophilus heathii and Megaderma lyra. Conclusions: CoVs from the same genetic lineage were found in different bat species roosting in similar or different locations. These data suggest that bat CoV lineages are not strictly concordant with their hosts. Our phylogenetic data indicates high diversity and a complex ecology of CoVs in bats sampled from specific areas in eastern regions of Thailand. Further characterization of additional CoV genes may be useful to better describe the CoV divergence.
3332d033b8fdccd2a2bc6e8a0c5f639eee248b1d	Increasingly, research attention is being afforded to various forms of problematic media use. Despite ongoing conceptual, theoretical, and empirical debates, a large number of retrospective self-report scales have been produced to ostensibly measure various classes of such behaviour. These scales are typically based on a variety of theoretical and diagnostic frameworks. Given current conceptual ambiguities, building on previous studies, we evaluated the dimensional structure of 50 scales targeting the assessment of supposedly problematic behaviours in relation to four technologies: Internet, smartphones, video games, and social network sites. We find that two dimensions ('compulsive use' and 'negative outcomes') account for over 50% of all scale-items analysed. With a median of five dimensions, on average, scales have considered fewer dimensions than various proposed diagnostic criteria and models. No relationships were found between the number of items in a scale and the number of dimensions, or the technology category and the dimensional structure. The findings indicate, firstly, that a majority of scales place an inordinate emphasis on some dimensions over others and, secondly, that despite differences in the items presented, at a dimensional level, there exists a high degree of similarity between scales. These findings highlight shortcomings in existing scales and underscore the need to develop more sophisticated conceptions and empirical tools to understand possible problematic interactions with various digital technologies.
f8adfe163136beec1ce05f46194aa24c0822bc5b	Purpose of Review This article provides an overview of the common and important chest injuries that the anesthesiologist may encounter in patients following trauma including blunt injury, pneumothorax, hemothorax, blunt aortic injury, and blunt cardiac injury. Recent Findings Rib fractures are frequently associated with chest injury and are associated with significant pain and other complications. Regional anesthesia techniques combined with a multimodal analgesic strategy can improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. There is increasing evidence for paravertebral blocks for this indication, and the myofascial plane blocks are a popular emerging technique. Recent changes to recommended management of tension pneumothorax are also described. Summary Chest trauma is commonly encountered, and anesthesiologists have the potential to significantly improve morbidity and mortality in this group of patients.
3b9561f73912aa671b35a6fcdbd1faebcd55763e	Hypothesis: The delayed lung damage after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by an autoimmune response to ACE2 induced by forced presentation of the ACE2 protein in a complex with CoV Spike in Fc Receptor positive Antigen Presenting Cells in the lung. The likelihood that this hypothesis is valid is low, but it is easily tested. Testable predictions: 1) Autoantibodies and T cells to ACE2 may be found in patients with the lung damage but not in those without 2) There may be an HLA linkage with the delayed lung disease 3) Vaccines based on the spike protein might initiate the process by amplifying Fc mediated uptake of ACE2-Spike complexes into APCs. Practical Implications: The development of autoantibodies to ACE2 might predict the development of the inflammatory phase of Covid-19 disease. It might be wise to consider engineering versions of the spike that no longer bind to ACE2 for inclusion in vaccines. Background: Infection by SARS-CoV-2 is followed by an inflammatory pneumonia in ~14% of cases (1) and widespread organ damage (2). The risk increases with age and certain predisposing conditions. Of these, hypertension stands out with 6.3% risk of death (3). The virus enters cells by binding to the ACE2 protein (4). ACE2 expression may be increased in hypertension, and this could be the basis for the predisposition by enhancing uptake of virus into cells that express ACE2 in lung, heart, blood vessels and kidney (5).
4631d1a1d9384ce4aa9d96d6695417357855ce84	Background: This scoping review maps population-based surveys and mental health literacy (MHL) interventions undertaken in China during 1997-2018 in order to identify research gaps. Method: Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. Results: MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China (n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. Conclusions: More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.
75aa45fec583443ad040672ab48b2c90825a94bb	Background: Quantitative survey of research articles, as an application of bibliometrics, is an effective tool for grasping overall trends in various medical research fields. This type of survey has been also applied to infectious disease research; however, previous studies were insufficient as they underestimated articles published in non-English or regional journals.
01e22956c79df3220a67bce71cf22de95d29b723	Humans who experience a primary dengue virus (DENV) infection develop antibodies that preferentially neutralize the homologous serotype responsible for infection. Affected individuals also generate cross-reactive antibodies against heterologous DENV serotypes, which are non-neutralizing. Dengue cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies can enhance infection of Fc receptor bearing cells and, potentially, exacerbate disease. The actual binding sites of human antibody on the DENV particle are not well defined. We characterized the specificity and neutralization potency of polyclonal serum antibodies and memory B-cell derived monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) from 2 individuals exposed to primary DENV infections. Most DENV-specific hMAbs were serotype cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing. Moreover, many hMAbs bound to the viral pre-membrane protein and other sites on the virus that were not preserved when the viral envelope protein was produced as a soluble, recombinant antigen (rE protein). Nonetheless, by modifying the screening procedure to detect rare antibodies that bound to rE, we were able to isolate and map human antibodies that strongly neutralized the homologous serotype of DENV. Our MAbs results indicate that, in these two individuals exposed to primary DENV infections, a small fraction of the total antibody response was responsible for virus neutralization.
a279f185e2b33e75f209bc892ddccedc36133ef5	This paper discusses the aspects of data reliability and user privacy for the emerging practice of mobile phone based contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic. Various countries and large technology companies have already used or plan to design and use mobile phone based solutions, in an effort to urgently expedite the process of identifying people who may have been exposed to the disease and limit its spread to the general population. However, serious concerns have been raised both in terms of the validity of the collected data as well as the extent to which implemented approaches can breach the privacy of the mobile phone users. This review examines the weaknesses of existing implementations and concludes with specific recommendations that can contribute towards increasing the safety of infrastructures that collect and process this kind of information, as well as the adoption and acceptance of these solutions from the public.
f0f0ef13afba2979ade2879b534fe05b8eb048c0	The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has prompted healthcare professionals to re-design and modify the standards of care and operating procedures relevant to dealing with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. The aim of this review is to highlight the key recommendations related to obstetric anaesthesia from scientific bodies in the United Kingdom and United States and to summarize recently developed and implemented clinical pathways for care of obstetric patients -specifically those requiring urgent general anaesthesia for caesarean section within a large maternity unit in London. The need to perform an emergency operative delivery in a timely manner while ensuring clinicians are suitably equipped and protected represents a uniquely challenging scenario, given the higher risk of viral transmission with aerosol generating procedures. In these settings, emphasis needs to be put on meticulous preparation, safety checklists and specific equipment and staffing adjustments. We present a structured framework comprised of four critical steps aimed to facilitate the development of local strategies and protocols.
7bb2233fecf687276332f5cfe4630d5286966390	Background: Griffithsin is a broad spectrum antiviral lectin that inhibits viral entry and maturation processes through binding clusters of oligomannose glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins. An efficient, scaleable manufacturing process for griffithsin active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is essential for particularly cost-sensitive products such as griffithsin -based topical microbicides for HIV-1 prevention in resource poor settings. Our previously published purification method used ceramic filtration followed by two chromatography steps, resulting in a protein recovery of 30%. Our objective was to develop a scalable purification method for griffithsin expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants that would increase yield, reduce production costs, and simplify manufacturing techniques. Considering the future need to transfer griffithsin manufacturing technology to resource poor areas, we chose to focus modifying the purification process, paying particular attention to introducing simple, low-cost, and scalable procedures such as use of temperature, pH, ion concentration, and filtration to enhance product recovery. Results: We achieved >99% pure griffithsin API by generating the initial green juice extract in pH 4 buffer, heating the extract to 55°C, incubating overnight with a bentonite MgCl 2 mixture, and final purification with Capto™ multimodal chromatography. Griffithsin extracted with this protocol maintains activity comparable to griffithsin purified by the previously published method and we are able to recover a substantially higher yield: 88 ± 5% of griffithsin from the initial extract. The method was scaled to produce gram quantities of griffithsin with high yields, low endotoxin levels, and low purification costs maintained. Conclusions: The methodology developed to purify griffithsin introduces and develops multiple tools for purification of recombinant proteins from plants at an industrial scale. These tools allow for robust cost-effective production and purification of griffithsin. The methodology can be readily scaled to the bench top or industry and process components can be used for purification of additional proteins based on biophysical characteristics.

76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3	Its apparent endemicity and the wide spread of its reservoir host (dromedary camels) in the Arabian Peninsula highlight the ongoing public health threat of this virus. Therefore, development of effective prophylactic vaccine needs to be urgently explored given that there are no approved prophylactics or therapeutics for humans or animals to date. Different vaccine candidates have been investigated but serious safety concerns remain over protein or full-length spike (S) protein-based vaccines. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of naked DNA vaccines expressing different fragments of MERS-CoV S protein in mice. We found that plasmids expressing full-length (pS) or S1-subunit (pS1) could induce significant levels of S1-specific antibodies (Abs) but with distinct IgG isotype patterns. Specifically, pS1 immunization elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response and generally higher levels of all IgG isotypes compared to pS vaccination. Interestingly, only mice immunized with pS1 demonstrated significant S1specific cellular immune response. Importantly, both constructs induced cross-neutralizing Abs against multiple strains of human and camel origins. These results indicate that vaccines expressing S1-subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein could represent a potential vaccine candidate without the possible safety concerns associated with full-length protein-based vaccines. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen recovered first from a fatal human case in Saudi Arabia in 2012 1 and continued to infect almost 1800 people in over 25 countries. Saudi Arabia has reported the largest number of cases so far with cases continuing to increase. The virus causes severe respiratory infection associated with fever, cough, acute pneumonia, shortness of breath, systemic infection and occasional multi-organ failure in infected individuals leading to death in 35-40% of the cases 2-4 . Such a severe disease usually occurs in immunocompromised patients, individuals with comorbidities and the elderly 1,4-6 . Most of the reported MERS cases are linked to hospital outbreaks and family clusters due to close contact with infected patients 4,7-10 . However, accumulating epidemiological data show high prevalence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from several Arabian and African countries, suggesting that dromedaries might be the reservoir hosts of this virus 4,11-15 . The continued endemicity of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula and the associated high death rate clearly represent a public health concern with potential global spread as observed in the recent outbreak in South Korea 10 . This is further complicated by the lack of prophylactic or therapeutic measures, underscoring the importance of preparedness research against this potential pandemic virus. Several supportive therapies and antivirals were proposed and examined for the treatment of MERS-CoV infections [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, most of these strategies were based on the experience gained during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak or from MERS-CoV in vitro studies and require further preclinical and
c21f187377f454dff39c726a947077a5c74ae016	The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirotris) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirusinduced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three Gtetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs. /). Support for G-quadruplex structures (G4) are four-stranded, inter-and intramolecular structures formed from guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences. The sequences can be identified by four tracts of two or more guanine bases that are separated by one or more nucleotides of varying composition. The sequences fold to form stacks of G-tetrads, planar structures composed of four guanine bases held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (Fig 1) [1] . The stacked G-tetrads are connected by loops which vary in size and sequence composition. The number of G-tetrads, the loop lengths, and the loop sequence composition are all known to affect the stability of the folded structure, with higher numbers of G-tetrads and shorter loop lengths tending toward greater stability [2, 3] . G4 are known to be involved in a series of key biological functions. In humans, G4 are found in telomeric repeats and serve to prevent degradation and genomic instability [4] . Their formation in this region is also known to decrease telomerase activity which is selectively expressed in a vast majority of cancers [5] . G4 located in the promoter region of genes act as transcriptional regulators [6] while those found in intronic and exonic regions play a role in alternative splicing [7, 8] . In RNA, G4 identified in 3' and 5' untranslated regions are known to regulate protein synthesis [9, 10] . G4 function as regulators through at least a couple of different mechanisms [1]. Their formation can inhibit transcription by blocking the activity of RNA polymerase. Alternatively, G4 can bind with other regulatory elements that either activate or repress transcription. A variety of different proteins are now known to bind with G4 in DNA and RNA [11] . In RNA, this includes proteins involved in splicing as well as protein synthesis [12] . Although much of the research on G4 is focused on humans, a regulatory role for G4 in prokaryotic cells is currently being established. In Escherichia coli, G4 are capable of forming and altering expression levels [13] , and in Neisseria gonorrhea, a G4 structure plays a critical role in antigenic variation [14] . Several G4 sequences have been identified in the promotor region of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) where ligand stabilization of a G4 located in the Nef gene reduced gene expression and repressed HIV-1 infectivity in an antiviral Fig 1.

3da1a03cb675f463b0d8e30744aa33512241dd29	Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is evidence that they have strong infectious ability. Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.

dd4af74690f14666094d9bd0130a260101f27c4f	A clinical prediction rule to prioritize SARS-CoV-2 testing improves daily case detection, flattens and delays the curve, and reduces hospital burden. Abstract: Prompt identification of cases is critical for slowing the spread of COVID-19. However, many areas have faced diagnostic testing shortages, requiring difficult decisions to be made regarding who receives a test, without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions. We used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive, and found that its application to prioritize testing increases the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. To consider the implications of these gains in daily case detection on the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized disease transmission model. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e. "flattens the curve"), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent social distancing measures), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden. In conclusion, we present a novel approach to evidence-based allocation of limited diagnostic capacity, to achieve public health goals for COVID-19.
b23cac0612d57e9423715244000640cfa844178d	A 52-year-old patient with SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia and treated with darunavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). After LMWH cessation, he developed superior mesenteric arterial thrombosis. An abdominal CT scan showed arterial thrombosis of vessels efferent of the superior mesenteric artery with bowel distension. COVID-19 may predispose to venous and arterial thromboembolism. Anticoagulation prophylaxis should be considered in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and potential thromboembolism investigated in each symptomatic patient affected by SARS-CoV-2. LEARNING POINTS • Potential thromboembolism must be investigated in each symptomatic patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. • The preventive and therapeutic use of antithrombotic agents should be strongly considered in order to mitigate thrombotic and haemorrhagic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
7d301234c3251abee951f0877e8d3a3b1fca6221	Background: Pneumonia, a leading cause of childhood mortality, is associated with household air pollution (HAP) exposure. Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). Methods: Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. Results: In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.
1002ecf8d075ecbffe0e379e7a8fb98f9789c8e7	1) Background: Virtual screening studies on the therapeutically relevant proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) require a detailed characterization of their druggable binding sites, and, more generally, a convenient pocket mapping represents a key step for structure-based in silico studies; (2) Methods: Along with a careful literature search on SARS-CoV-2 protein targets, the study presents a novel strategy for pocket mapping based on the combination of pocket (as performed by the well-known FPocket tool) and docking searches (as performed by PLANTS or AutoDock/Vina engines); such an approach is implemented by the Pockets 2.0 plug-in for the VEGA ZZ suite of programs; (3) Results: The literature analysis allowed the identification of 16 promising binding cavities within the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the here proposed approach was able to recognize them showing performances clearly better than those reached by the sole pocket detection; and (4) Conclusions: Even though the presented strategy should require more extended validations, this proved successful in precisely characterizing a set of SARS-CoV-2 druggable binding pockets including both orthosteric and allosteric sites, which are clearly amenable for virtual screening campaigns and drug repurposing studies. All results generated by the study and the Pockets 2.0 plug-in are available for download.
ee1c20d3d0762e07830b93f37313b5549c08dc25	In 2015, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus occurred in Saudi Arabia and necessitated special measures to be implemented to control the spread of the virus. In this article, we will discuss how the outbreak was managed in the vascular and interventional radiology (VIR) suite in a large tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. Various measures were taken to reduce the risk of transmission of infection. Unit-level education played an important role in the care of patients. A hospital-wide educational program was implemented to ensure zero transmission of infection. Special attention was made to monitor staff who acquired the virus. VIR suite was able to handle the situation and control the outbreak.
3959ab255fd5f8ba79cd04285ac445d848a77659	Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect humans and many animal species, and are associated with respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and central nervous system diseases. The large size of the CoV genome and the instability of some CoV replicase gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria, represent serious obstacles for the development of reverse genetic systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense RNA viruses. To overcome these limitations, several alternatives to more conventional plasmid-based approaches have been established in the last thirteen years. In this report, we briefly review and discuss the different reverse genetic systems developed for CoVs, paying special attention to the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV).
bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are formally described by isolation of their circular double-stranded DNA genomes and establishment and comparison of the nucleotide sequence of these genomes. Alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of HPVs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible. Novel HPV isolates have traditionally been described as "types". The analysis of specific HPV types is of medical importance, because HPV types typically induce type-specific lesions, i.e. they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia, or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas. Recently, it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses. Within the papillomavirus family, closely or remotely related types form species or genera. These formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses, bacteria and higher organisms, although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited. Notably, however, HPV types that are closely related (i.e. form "species") are associated with similar lesions. Confusion of the terms "type" and "subtype" should be avoided, as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages. In contrast to many RNA viruses, HPV types evolve very slowly, and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2%. These divergent isolates are called "variants". HPVs evolved together with humankind and Homo sapiens was never without HPVs, and consequently never without warts and cervical cancer. Variants of the same HPV type may have different pathogenicity and may account for part of the worldwide disparities in the occurrence of genital cancers.

The duration, coronavirus takes to spread from one country to another country, could be seen in this dataset and could predicted the same for future pandemics through this dataset. It is highly dependent on the cabalistic number of variables that is the main navel of these datasets. Information for this dataset is collected from trusted websites, local and international popular newspapers. This coronavirus dataset not only help to track the spreading route of coronavirus but also can be used for predicting the possible spreading route of similar future pandemics. This dataset consists of 186 countries' useful data related to COVID-19 pandemic from November 17, 2019, to May 16, 2020, with 8 unique variables that provide the information of the nature of the spread of COVID-19. The datasets mainly focus on two major fields, first one is First Case which consists of information of Date of First Case(s), Number of confirm Case(s) at First Day, Age of the patient(s) of First Case, Last Visited Country and the other one First Death information consist of Date of First Death and Age of the Patient who died first for every Country mentioning corresponding Continent.This dataset also can perform a bunch of predictions using Machine Learning applications, like -how fast the virus is spreading, affect rate, death rate, death rate and able to represent comparison between other pandemics. Using this dataset, any similar pandemic spreadness could be predicted earlier and necessary precaution measures could be taken.
73caa9dfad143230cc44af79f24b4d99194a848f	Rotavirus NSP2 is an abundant non-structural RNA-binding protein essential for forming the viral factories that support replication of the double-stranded RNA genome. NSP2 exists as stable doughnut-shaped octamers within the infected cell, representing the tail-to-tail interaction of two tetramers. Extending diagonally across the surface of each octamer are four highly basic grooves that function as binding sites for single-stranded RNA. Between the N and C-terminal domains of each monomer is a deep electropositive cleft containing a catalytic site that hydrolyzes the γ-β phosphoanhydride bond of any NTP. The catalytic site has similarity to those of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide-binding proteins. Due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts, we investigated the possibility that the RNA-binding activity of the groove promoted the insertion of the 5′-triphosphate moiety of the RNA into the cleft, and the subsequent hydrolysis of its γ-β phosphoanhydride bond. Our results show that NSP2 hydrolyzes the γP from RNAs and NTPs through Mg 2+dependent activities that proceed with similar reaction velocities, that require the catalytic His225 residue, and that produce a phosphorylated intermediate. Competition assays indicate that although both substrates enter the active site, RNA is the preferred substrate due to its higher affinity for the octamer. The RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) activity of NSP2 may account for the absence of the 5′-terminal γP on the (−) strands of the double-stranded RNA genome segments. This is the first report of a HIT-like protein with a multifunctional catalytic site, capable of accommodating both NTPs and RNAs during γP hydrolysis.

For this reason, data must be transferred to the ground station and processed through a time/computing-consuming focusing algorithm. Thanks to the advances in avionic technology, now GPUs are available for onboard processing, and an opportunity for SAR focusing opened. Due to the unavailability of avionic platforms for this research, we developed a GPU-parallel algorithm on commercial off-theshelf graphics cards, and with the help of a proper scaling factor, we projected execution times for the case of an avionic GPU. We evaluated performance using ENVISAT (Environmental Satellite) ASAR Image Mode level 0 on both NVIDIA Kepler and Turing architectures.
f720a25037eb5929356b35a90306a3b88642f04e	We formulate three basic assumptions that should ideally guide any welldesigned COVID-19 prevalence study. We provide, on the basis of these assumptions alone, a full derivation of mathematical formulas required for statistical analysis of testing data. In particular, we express the disease prevalence in a population through those for its homogeneous subpopulations. Although some of these formulas are routinely employed in prevalence studies, the study design often contravenes the assumptions upon which these formulas vitally depend. We also designed a natural prevalence estimator from the testing data and studied some of its properties. The results are equally valid for diseases other than COVID-19 as well as in non-epidemiological settings.
1000bb530ad4470adf1759d6db0bdf35bcddfe60	On March 13th, 2020, The World Health Organization effectively established that Europe is the new the COVID-19 pandemic world epicenter, as cases in Italy and other European nations soared. The numbers in Italy have climbed with over 80,000 cases as of March 25th, 2020 and with over 8000 deaths, placing Italy now as the country with the highest mortality rate. Importantly, older adults are particularly vulnerable to get severe illness, complications, and to have a higher mortality rate than any other age group. The clinical presentation in older adults with severe illness, in the experience from geriatricians in Lombardy, is described as quite sudden; patients can develop severe hypoxemia with the need of ventilation support in few hours. Geriatric syndromes are not a common form of presentation for COVID-19 in severe illness. It is suggested that stratification by frailty level may help to detect the most vulnerable, and decisions about healthcare resource prioritization should not be taken based only on age itself or previous diagnosis, such as having dementia.
639d72e58322c4b81bb89ad026ac84908fbcab7e	It is not widely known that quite a few researchers are faced with difficulties in using various resources of disaster management research in Korea. The article aims to assess how rigorously the Korean field of disaster management research resources has been managed or how it can be improved for the ultimate goal of disaster management. Descriptive content analysis has been used as the major methodology by referring to the Johari window. In doing so, electronic research resources have been systematically compared with integrated research resources via the perspective of Korean-speaking researchers and that of English-speaking researchers. The conclusion is that two researchers have to be integrated with all four research resources (open, blind, hidden, and unknown resources) by implementing assigned responsibilities as well as freely asking questions. Ultimately, this will be conducive to reducing down the impacts of disaster in Korea.
7da72db559c616a430aa3e2d779528f0239e3993	To confirm the relationship between sex and the progression of Coronavirus , and its potential mechanism, among severe patients. For this retrospective study, we included 168 consecutive severe patients with pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized between January 16th and February 4th, 2020, at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and outcomes were compared and analyzed between males and females. In the present study, we analyzed 168 severe patients with COVID-19, including 86 males and 82 females, and 48 patients (28.6%) were diagnosed as critically ill. Of 86 male patients, 12.8% (11/86) died and 75.6% (65/86) were discharged; of 82 female patients, 7.3% (6/82) died and 86.6% (71/82) were discharged. Eleven laboratory parameters showed significant differences between male and female patients, and six of them were higher during the whole clinical course in patients who died than in patients who were discharged. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, males with comorbidities presented a higher risk of being critically ill than males without comorbidities (OR = 3.824, 95% CI = 1.279-11.435). However, this association attenuated to null in female patients (OR = 2.992, 95% CI = 0.937-9.558). A similar sex-specific trend was observed in the relation between age and critically ill conditions. We highlighted sexspecific differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis. Male patients appeared to be more susceptible to age and comorbidities. Sex is an important biological variable that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Herpes virus y más especialmente citomegalovirus y virus de Epstein-Barr son los que con más frecuencia afectan a estos enfermos, así como los virus respiratorios. El tratamiento consiste en la combinación de reducir la inmunodepresión inducida junto con tratamiento antiviral. Se ha realizado una revisión de la literatura pormenorizada y actualizada de la epidemiología, la patogenia, las manifestaciones clínicas y la aproximación terapéutica de las infecciones virales en estos enfermos. Abstract Being a solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient as well as receiving chemotherapy for a malignant hematological disease clearly predispose the subject to a variety of viral infections, both common and opportunistic diseases. The patient may have acquired these infections from the community as well as from the donor organ (donor-derived infections) and/or from reactivation of an endogenous latent virus. Herpes viruses and especially the cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus are among the most common of the opportunistic viral pathogens affecting these patients, in addition to respiratory viruses. Treatment consists in antiviral drug therapies combined with the reduction in the degree of the induced immunosuppression. A review of the literature has been performed in order to update the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and therapeutic approach of the viral infections in these immunocompromised patients.
713ebd54a9147bcf49995bab8fe959a8735ec2ed	Genetic information is passed with high accuracy from the parental organism to the offspring and its expression governs the biochemical and physiological tasks of the cell. Although different types of cells exist and are shaped by development to fill different physiological niches, all cells have fundamental similarities and share common principles of organization and biochemical activities. This chapter gives an overview of general principles of the storage and flow of genetic information. It aims to summarize and describe in a broadly approachable way, from the point of view of molecular biology, some general terms, mechanisms and processes used as a base for the molecular computing in the subsequent chapters. In the majority of living organisms the genetic information is stored in the desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), molecules that govern the development and functions of the organisms. The high accuracy of duplication and transmission of the DNA is determined by its structural features and the unique fidelity of the proteins participating in this process. DNA is composed of four nucleotides, also called bases: adenosine (A), cytidine (C), guanosine (G), and thymidine (T), each of which consists of a phosphate group, a sugar (deoxyribose), and a nucleobase (pyrimidine -thymine and cytosine, or purine -adenine and guanine). The nucleotides are covalently linked through the sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate residue and form the backbone of one DNA strand (Fig. 3.1) . These two different elements Z.

The presented method solves an inverse problem to discover the effectively decisive topology of a heterogeneous network and reveal the transmission parameters which govern the stochastic spreads over the network from a dataset on an infectious disease outbreak in the early growth phase. Populations in a combination of epidemiological compartment models and a meta-population network model are described by stochastic differential equations. Probability density functions are derived from the equations and used for the maximal likelihood estimation of the topology and parameters. The method is tested with computationally synthesized datasets and the WHO dataset on SARS outbreak.
ac4a3bbe27272cd6780e7168906b0bf1413fc749	The detection of nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors is an ancient and 27 conserved component of the innate immune system. Notably, RNA virus genomes 28 are sensed by mammalian cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors, thereby activating 29 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to restrict viral replication. However, 30 recent evidence indicates that the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway also 31 protects against RNA viruses. So far, the mechanisms responsible for DNA sensing 32 of RNA viruses, which replicate without known DNA intermediates, remain unclear. 33 By using cGAS gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell 34 , we discovered that DNA sensing and cGAMP synthase activities are 35 required for cGAS-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis 36 virus. The level of cGAMP produced in response to RNA virus infection was below 37 the threshold of detection, suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of 38 cGAMP are produced during RNA virus infections. To clarify the DNA ligands that 39 activate cGAS activity, we confirmed that cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA in the 40 cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of 41 cGAS-associated mitochondrial DNA did not change in response to virus infection. 42 Rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs, including mitochondrial DNA and 43 endogenous cDNAs, may serve as stimuli for basal cGAS activation. Importantly, 44 cGAS knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cGAS drives 45 low-level ISG expression at steady state. We propose that cGAS-STING restricts 46 RNA viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely 47 primed by endogenous cellular DNA ligands. 48 . Importance 49 Many medically important RNA viruses are restricted by the cGAS-STING 50 DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. Since these viruses replicate 51 without DNA intermediates, it is unclear what DNA ligand(s) are responsible for 52 triggering this pathway. We show here that cGAS's DNA binding and signaling 53 activities are required for RNA virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it 54 restricts DNA viruses. Furthermore, we confirmed that cGAS continuously binds host 55 DNA, which was unaffected by RNA virus infection. Finally, cGAS expression 56 correlated with the low-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes in uninfected 57 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that cGAS-mediated sensing of 58 endogenous DNA ligands contributes to RNA virus restriction by establishing a 59 baseline of innate immune activation. doi: bioRxiv preprint 61 A key feature of innate immunity is the detection of pathogen-associated 62 molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (1). For 63 mammalian cells, viral nucleic acids are detected by distinct PRRs, triggering 64 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to set up an antiviral state. During RNA 65 virus infections, uncapped and double-stranded RNAs are detected in the cytosol by 66 the PRRs retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and related RIG-I-like receptors 67 (RLRs). However, the recent discovery of the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing 68 pathway, and the observation that it can also restrict RNA viruses (2), reveals a need 69 to further investigate the mechanisms of nucleic acid sensing during RNA virus 70 infection. 71 The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum-and 72 mitochondrial-bound protein that spontaneously activates ISG expression when 73 overexpressed (2). Although STING is involved in DNA sensing, STING -/mice and 74 mouse endothelial fibroblasts (MEFs) are more permissive for vesicular stomatitis 75 virus (VSV), a negative-stand RNA virus (2, 3). Additionally, studies in MEFs 76 deficient in three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), a nuclease important for the 77 turnover of cytosolic retroelement cDNAs (4), have described enhanced antiviral 78 phenotypes in response to a wide array of RNA viruses and retroviruses, 79 presumably due to the accumulation of DNA in the cytosol (5, 6). It appears that this 80 DNA-based restriction is broad, as many RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to 81 subvert the cGAS-STING pathway, including flaviviruses (7-9), hepaciviruses (10, 82 STING does not directly interact with cytosolic DNA, but functions as an innate 84 immune adaptor protein to transduce signals between cyclic GMP-AMP synthase 85 (cGAS) and Tank-binding kinase 1, which subsequently phosphorylates the 86 transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to initiate an ISG response doi: bioRxiv preprint 157 158 growth of VSV-GFP, VSVΔM51A-GFP, and SINV-GFP, while THP-1 KO cells or 159 THP-1 KO cells reconstituted with inactive hcGAS-HA3x mutants showed little or no 160 restriction (Figure 3D-3F). As observed previously in MEFs, VSVΔM51A-GFP was 161 more potently restricted than VSV-GFP, but unlike in MEFs, infected fewer cells 162 expressing mutant cGAS. This was also true for SINV-GFP, albeit restriction with 163 WT hcGAS-HA3x was extremely potent, comparatively. It is unclear whether these 164 modest decreases in infection of the cGAS mutants was due to hcGAS-HA3x 165 overexpression in THP-1 cells, residual hcGAS activities, or normal clonal 166 variation of cells. Nevertheless, these results are most consistent with an integral 167 role for cGAS DNA binding and cGAMP synthase activities in RNA virus restriction. 168 Detection of cGAMP produced in response to DNA transfection but not 169 RNA virus infection. Because cGAMP synthesis activity was essential for RNA 170 virus restriction, we next sought to identify cGAMP produced in response to RNA . 676 2013.

04c5c55f5258fa7fe5f5d404e6af5a5262f273c1	We find that the novel A/H1N1 influenza viruses exhibit very low genetic divergence and suffer strong purifying selection among human population and confirm that they originated from the reassortment of previous triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses including genomic segments from both avian and human lineages with North American and Eurasian swine lineages. The longer phylogenetic branch length to their nearest genetic neighbors indicates that the origin of the novel A/H1N1 is unlikely to be a very recent event. Seventy-six new unique mutations are found to be monomorphically fixed in the novel A/H1N1 virus lineages, suggesting a role of selective sweep in the early evolution of this virus.

6166f34d37b237974f413b6dc5a9b85f82fe0d3e	The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 has caused, by May 24th 2020, more than 5.3 million confirmed cases worldwide. The necessity of keeping open and accessible public commercial establishments such as supermarkets or pharmacies increases during the pandemic provided that distancing rules and crowd control are satisfied. Herein, using agent-based models, we explore the potential spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 considering the case of a small size supermarket. For diverse distancing rules and number of simultaneous users (customers), we question flexible and limited movement policies, guiding the flow and interactions of users in place. Results indicate that a guided, limited in movement and well-organized policy combined with a distance rule of at least 1 m between users and a small number of them (15) may aid in the mitigation of potential new contagions in more than 90% compared to the usual policy of flexible movement with more users (30) which may reach up to 64% of mitigation of potential new infections under the same distancing conditions. This study may guide novel strategies for the mitigation of the current COVID-19 pandemic, at any stage, and prevention of future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses. All rights reserved.

The world is currently impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which is caused by the severe acute 2 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that, by May 24th 2020, has caused more than 5.3 million confirmed cases. 3 Many authorities at the global level have adopted measures known as "physical distancing" or "social distancing" (SD) which 4 go from schools and workplaces closure to limiting gatherings, quarantining infected individuals and their family members 5 and self-quarantining to avoid getting infected 1, 2 . Besides, hygiene measures have been large recommended, these include 6 washing hands, covering up when coughing or sneezing, and avoid touching the face with unwashed hands since these may be 7 frequently touched by other potentially infected people. One of the first reported studies of the potential effect of SD strategies 8 on COVID-19 burden was developed in Singapore 3 and the interventions continued in other several European countries 4 . The 9 objective of the SD interventions is to decelerate the spread of infection and reduce the intensity of the epidemic to avoid 10 potential overwhelming health systems and, at the same time, gain a time-line to develop treatments and vaccines. However, 11 a matter of consideration is that these interventions may hold for long periods with certain relaxing phases as population 12 immunity gradually increases allowing the measures to loosen 1, 5 . There is still limited evidence to support SD measures as 13 schemes of reducing transmission and slowing down the spread, however, accessible evidence may suggest that staggered 14 and cumulative implementation of these interventions, in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases 6 15 following close scientific and ethical basis, show the most effective outcome against COVID-19 7-9 . 16 One of the most important players of goods supply chains for the population, as well as key social encounter places, are 17 public commercial establishments. Supermarkets, pharmacies, grocery stores, discount stores, and other commercial chains can 18 act as a route of spread for both, clients (users) and place workers 10 . Public commercial establishments are generally enclosed 19 places usually with one entrance and one exit gates that under normal situations, SD measures and the number of users has no 20 relevance. Inside the establishment, users freely interact with each other following pretty well-defined trajectories as those of 21 supermarket corridors. In this manner, users and working personnel in place can be characterized in terms of their movements 22 when following the corridors as well as their physical interactions and the physical distance between and among them, under a 23 physical metric. In this direction, agent-based (AB) modeling schemes can map all desired characteristics of users and workers, 24 the agents, and their interactions in the establishment's corridors, identified as agents' trajectories or paths. AB schemes have 25 previously been used to devise strategies on health behaviors, social epidemiology 11 , and to advise on the mitigation of previous 26 influenza outbreaks 12 as well as to explore immune responses to this virus 13 . Under this approach, AB schemes are also to be 27 employed for testing population strategies for enclosed environments for the coronavirus pandemic 14 that may add to the forces 28 of non-pharmaceutical interventions 15 especially in high-density population places, like urban scenarios 16 . Moreover, since 29 specific conditions and characterizations can be implemented for agents and trajectories, diverse behavioral aspects can be 30 designed and tested, for instance, the checkout area design of a supermarket to model the users flow and guidance strategies 17 . Herein, we explore the potential spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in public commercial establishments using an AB 32 approach.

db361f98f584f900325b649f3ffa0e8057d0f20c	Background: Patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's often present with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia and retention) resulting from damage to the peripheral and central nervous systems. These studies were designed to examine the changes in the function of the bladder that may underlie neurogenic bladder dysfunction using a mouse model of demyelination in the CNS. Methods: Bladders from 12 week old male C57BL/6J mice with coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (CIE, a chronic, progressive demyelinating disease model of human MS), and age-matched controls, were cut into 5-7 strips and suspended in physiological muscle baths for tension measurement in response to agonists and electric field stimulation (EFS). Experiments were performed on intact and denuded (with mucosa removed) bladder strips. Results: The maximum effect of EFS was not significantly different between CIE and control bladders. Nerve-evoked EFS contractions (tetrodotoxin-sensitive) were blocked by a combination of atropine (cholinergic antagonist) and a,b-methylene ATP (an ATP analog that desensitizes purinergic receptors). In response to EFS, the a,b-methylene ATP-resistant (cholinergic) component of contraction was significantly reduced, while the atropine-resistant (purinergic) component was significantly increased in CIE bladders. Removal of the mucosa in CIE bladders restored the cholinergic component. Bethanechol (muscarinic receptor agonist) potency was significantly increased in CIE bladders. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate a deficit in the nerve-evoked cholinergic component of contraction that is not due to the ability of the smooth muscle to respond to acetylcholine. We conclude that neurodegenerative bladder dysfunction in this model of multiple sclerosis may be due, in part, to pathologic changes in the mucosa that causes suppression of muscarinic receptor-mediated contractile response and augmentation of purinergic response of the underlying muscle. Further studies utilizing CIE mice should help elucidate the pathological changes in the mucosa resulting from demyelination in the CNS.
068b862614556a9971ba12b044337e14875b65b7	Pathogenesis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is poorly understood. Most histologic studies come from post-mortem analysis, with existing data indicating that histologic features of acute respiratory distress syndrome are typically present in fatal cases. However, this observation may be misleading, due to confounding factors in pre-terminal disease, including injury resulting from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Ante-mortem lung biopsy may provide major pathogenetic insights, potentially providing a basis for novel treatment approaches. This comparative, multicenter, prospective, observational study was planned to identify antemortem histological profile and immunohistochemical features of lung tissue in patients with Covid-19 in early and late phases of the disease, including markers of inflammatory cells and major pathways involved in the cytokine storm triggering. Enrolled patients underwent lung biopsy, according to the study protocol approved by local Ethical Committee, either within 15 days of the first symptoms appearing (early phase) or after >15 days (more advanced disease). Key exclusion criteria were excessive or uncorrectable bleeding risk and cardiovascular disease with heart failure. Lung samples were obtained by conventional transbronchial biopsy, trans-bronchial lung cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy. 23 patients were enrolled: 12 patients underwent lung biopsy within 15 days and 11 patients more than 15 days after the onset of symptoms. Early biopsies were characterized by spots of patchy acute lung injury (ALI) with alveolar type II cells hyperplasia and significant vascular abnormalities (disordered angiogenesis with alveolar capillary hyperplasia, luminal enlargement and thickened walls of pulmonary venules, perivascular CD4-T-cell infiltration), with no hyaline membranes.

9c9f4048c8a20fe4874977a6cffc56ebfeab6edf	The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber, Rüppell, 1842) is a unique eusocial rodent with the unusually long lifespan (an order of magnitude longer than the lifespan of laboratory mice and rats), and this is the reason for increasing interest in this animal of biologists with differ ent specialties [1 8]. Sometimes these animals are referred to as an ageless species (more accurately, to species with negligibly small aging) [1 4] or considered an example of neoteny among mammals [5 8]. Studies on spontaneous and experimentally induced pathologic changes in the naked mole rat are among the most inter esting aspects of its biology, especially on the age related and neoplastic changes and on the possible causes of its natural mortality. Although in all these aspects there are still more questions than answers, some definite findings were obtained recently, and we think that a review of them would be useful as a jumping off place for further studies. We think that studies not only in pathologic anatomy of this unusual animal could be useful, but also in the fields where the naked mole rat is an important model animal in gerontology and biology of eusocial animals. According to the tradition adopted in pathology of laboratory ani mals, all lesions known in the naked mole rat will be sub divided into infectious and noninfectious pathologies. Problems of tumor growth, age related changes of organs and tissues, and causes of spontaneous death of this rodent will be considered separately. Abbreviations: CPN, chronic progressive nephropathy; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; ras, (rat sarcoma) oncogene; SV40 TAg, simian virus 40 tumor antigen. Abstract-The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber, Rüppell, 1842) is a unique eusocial rodent with unusually long lifes pan. Therefore, the study of spontaneous and experimentally induced pathologies in these animals is one of the most impor tant tasks of gerontology. Various infections, noninfectious pathologies (including age dependent changes), and tumors have been described in the naked mole rat. The most frequent pathologies are traumas (bite wounds), purulent and septic com plications of traumatic injuries, renal tubular calcinosis, chronic progressive nephropathy, hepatic hemosiderosis, testicular interstitial cell hyperplasia, calcinosis cutis, cardiomyopathy, and dysbiosis related infectious lesions of the digestive system. However, the summarized data on pathology (including tumor incidence) and on the causes of mortality are insufficient. There are only few publications about the results of experiments where pathologies were induced in the naked mole rat. All these problems could be subjects for promising future studies without which adequate studies on mechanisms providing the long lifespan of the naked mole rat are impossible, as well as the elucidation of causes of tumor resistance of this species.
b54c233ac33061fe13fc6b56ddc4b62cd956c33b	An increase in coronavirus disease infections prompted Level 4 lockdown throughout New Zealand from 25 March 2020. We have investigated trends in coronary and electrophysiology (EP) procedures before and during this lockdown. The number of acute procedures for ST elevation myocardial infarction remained stable. In contrast, the number of in-patient angiograms and percutaneous intervention procedures fell by 53% compared with the previous 4 weeks in 2020 and by 56% compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Further study is required to determine the reasons for these trends.
03302abf698fc986829cbbbd9f660abdbf9321e3	Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious respiratory coronavirus of domestic chickens. Although mortality is low, infection with IBV results in substantial losses for the egg and meat chicken industries. Despite the economic importance of IBV and decades of research into the pathogenesis of infection, significant gaps in our knowledge exist. The aim of this study was to compare the early progression of air sac lesions in birds receiving a vaccine strain of the virus or a more virulent field strain. The air sacs are lined by different types of epithelia and are relatively isolated from the environment, so they represent a unique tissue in which to study virus-induced lesions. Both the pathogenic and vaccine strains of the virus produced significant lesions; however, the lesions progressed more rapidly in the birds receiving the pathogenic strain. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in birds infected with the pathogenic strain of virus, IBV spike protein is detected first in the ciliated cells lining the air sac. These preliminary data provide important clues regarding potential mechanisms for IBV tissue tropism and spread and show that the nature of the virus isolate influences the early progression of IBV infection.
6101fcc0282d2e355b5e094de10aafaa05e749c6	Purpose: To investigate the association between necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and red blood cell transfusions in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. Methods: We studied were 180 VLBW preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of CHA Gangnam Hospital from January of 2006 to December of 2009. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: an NEC group (greater than stage II on the modified Bell's criteria) and a control group (less than stage II on the modified Bell's critieria). We defined red blood cell transfusion before NEC diagnosis as the frequency of transfusion until NEC diagnosis (mean day at NEC diagnosis, day 18) in the NEC group and the frequency of transfusion until 18 days after birth in the control group. Results: Of the 180 subjects, 18 (10%) belonged to the NEC group, and 14 (78%) of these 18 patients had a history of transfusion before NEC diagnosis. The NEC group received 3.1±2.9 transfusions, and the control group received 1.0±1.1 transfusions before the NEC diagnosis (P=0.005). In a multi variate logistic regression corrected for gestational age, Apgar score at 1 minute, the presence of respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, premature rupture of membrane, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and death were confounding factors. The risk of NEC increased 1.63 times (95% confidence interval, 1.145 to 2.305; P=0.007) with transfusion before the NEC diagnosis. Conclusion: The risk for NEC increased significantly with increased transfusion frequency before the NEC diagnosis.
31c34a61eda68c99f550f22dd6a2393b53573fb1	Ken Burns, a well-known documentarian has produced a film titled, "The Gene: An Intimate History" based on Siddhartha Mukherjee's book by the same name. The film focuses sharply on the history of genetics, the science of inheritance and variation, in particular, the gene, the central player in genetics, its discovery, structure and function as well as its myriad influence on development, growth, health, disease and evolution of all organisms. Importantly, he has shown how geneticists, physicians, patients and their families as well as society at large must cooperate, develop mutual trust and share ethical responsibilities in order to predict, prevent, manage and cure many inherited disorders. Mr. Burns has reinforced these ideas beautifully with illustrations, archived film footage, location filming and commentaries. The film also hints at the need for taking a unified Darwinian-Mendelian and Hippocratic approach toward building a healthier human society. In short, this is a beautiful and engrossing documentary on the future of Genetic Medicine.
e06e5e35cbdabb92f66c9a4dace03761d3685051	Circuit compliance close to lung compliance can create serious problems in effective and safe mechanical ventilation of preterm infants. We considered what ventilation technique is the most beneficial in this case. A hybrid (numerical-physical) simulator of infant respiratory system mechanics, the Bennett Ventilator and NICO apparatus were used to simulate pressure-controlled ventilation (PC) and volume-controlled ventilation with constant flow (VCV CF ) and descending flow (VCV DF ), under permissive hypercapnia (PHC) (6 ml kg −1 ) and normocapnia (SV) (8 ml kg −1 ) conditions. Respiratory rate (RR) was 36 or 48 min −1 and PEEP was 0.3 or 0.6 kPa. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean airway pressure (MAP), and work of breathing by the ventilator (WOB) were lower (P < 0.01, 1 − β = 0.9) using the PHC strategy compared to the SV strategy. The WOB increased (P < 0.01; 1 − β = 0.9) when the RR increased. The PC, VCV CF , and VCV DF modes did not differ in minute ventilation produced by the ventilator (MV V ), but the PC mode delivered the highest minute ventilation to the patient (MV T ) (P < 0.01; 1 − β = 0.9) at the same PIP, MAP, and WOB. The most beneficial ventilation technique appeared to be PC ventilation with the PHC strategy, with lower RR (36 min −1 ).
7cfc90942e02ac47be6cb1fc0baac645673a93a5	The maintenance of infectious diseases requires a sufficient number of susceptible hosts. Host culling is a potential control strategy for animal diseases. However, the reduction in biodiversity and increasing public concerns regarding the involved ethical issues have progressively challenged the use of wildlife culling. Here, we assess the potential of wildlife culling as an epidemiologically sound management tool, by examining the host ecology, pathogen characteristics, eco-sociological contexts, and field work constraints. We also discuss alternative solutions and make recommendations for the appropriate implementation of culling for disease control.
93d080273b1f33330243dd140a35ba890ddd2973	Background: Nurses leaving their jobs and the profession are an issue of international concern, with supplydemand gaps for nurses reported to be widening. There is a large body of existing literature, much of which is already in review form. In order to advance the usefulness of the literature for nurse and human resource managers, we undertook an overview (review of systematic reviews). The aim of the overview was to identify high quality evidence of the determinants and consequences of turnover in adult nursing. Methods: Reviews were identified which were published between 1990 and January 2015 in English using electronic databases (the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, CINAHL plus and SCOPUS) and forward searching. All stages of the review were conducted in parallel by two reviewers. Reviews were quality appraised using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews and their findings narratively synthesised. Results: Nine reviews were included. We found that the current evidence is incomplete and has a number of important limitations. However, a body of moderate quality review evidence does exist giving a picture of multiple determinants of turnover in adult nursing, with -at the individual level -nurse stress and dissatisfaction being important factors and -at the organisational level -managerial style and supervisory support factors holding most weight. The consequences of turnover are only described in economic terms, but are considered significant. In making a quality assessment of the review as well as considering the quality of the included primary studies and specificity in the outcomes they measure, the overview found that the evidence is not as definitive as previously presented from individual reviews. Further research is required, of rigorous research design, whether quantitative or qualitative, particularly against the outcome of actual turnover as opposed to intention to leave.

This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006-2014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch between the vaccine lineage and the predominant circulating lineage (91.4% [2013]) was observed. Local surveillance data reveal a distinct and dynamic distribution of respiratory viruses over the years. Data from published literature and abstracts show that influenza B is a significant cause of disease with an unpredictable circulation pattern and showing trends indicating reemergence of the B/Victoria lineage. The abstracts report notable levels of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages (2000-2013). Mismatch between the Southern hemisphere vaccine and the most prevalent circulating viruses in Brazil were observed in five influenza seasons. The evidence on co-circulation of two influenza B lineages and mismatched seasons in Brazil indicates the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines in conferring broader seasonal influenza protection. Additionally, improving influenza surveillance platforms in Brazil is important for monitoring disease trends and the impact of introducing seasonal influenza vaccination.
798b2da065262143700d1707c9aa67ca5fe1c8b3	When specific events seem to spur others in their wake, marked Hawkes processes enable us to reckon with their statistics. The underdetermined empirical nature of these event-triggering mechanisms hinders estimation in the multivariate setting. Spatiotemporal applications alleviate this obstacle by allowing relationships to depend only on relative distances in real Euclidean space; we employ the framework as a vessel for embedding arbitrary event types in a new latent space. By performing synthetic experiments on short records as well as an investigation into options markets and pathogens, we demonstrate that learning the embedding alongside a point process model uncovers the coherent, rather than spurious, interactions. Preprint. Under review. arXiv:2005.02515v3 [stat.ML] 2 Jun 2020 their separation in space, invariant to absolute positioning. We show that it is feasible to conjure a latent metric representation of the event types by harnessing a spatiotemporal approach outside the spatial context. We tailor the latent space towards the precise interactions between events. Our first contribution is a model that captures multivariate point-process regularities in a compressed metric space; the second is a couple of estimation algorithms founded on the expectationmaximization (EM) technique in identifying Hawkes processes [10, 11, 12] . A latent structure introduced in the E-step to codify potential causality (Figure 1 ) permits tractable solutions in the M-step, which we exploit to optimize the embedding directly. Third, our findings on diverse social datasets beat the state of the art with qualitatively intuitive representations [13, 14, 15] . We successfully learn the regional diffusion process for the 2014-2015 ebola outbreak as well as the influences between options trades in different stocks. We also optimized an embedding for the South Korean early outbreak record [22] , showcased in Appendix B for lack of sufficient space. One active line of work, paralleling ours, embeds each event based on some conceived heuristic like temporal proximity [16, 17, 18] ; another direction of inquiry entails the estimation of low-rank multivariate Hawkes processes [19, 20, 21] . We differ from both in learning an actual metric-space representation vis-à-vis the real Hawkes likelihood. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a Euclidean embedding scheme driven entirely by an underlying marked Hawkes [23] process.
6ecf2ae82ffc0d505d034ec608fe394153c56c86	The recently emerged coronavirus in Wuhan, China has claimed at least six lives as of January 22 and infected hundreds if not thousands of individuals. The situation has drawn international attention, including from the virology community. We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists, but we also believe that increased transparency on disease reporting and data sharing with international colleagues are crucial for curbing the spread of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world. It is now clear that the mysterious respiratory illness in Wuhan is caused by a new type of coronavirus distantly related to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1, 2] . We applaud the rapid release to the public of the genome sequence of the new virus by Chinese virologists [3], as this represents an important first step in curbing the spread of the new virus to other parts of the world. Viruses emerge and re-emerge globally without consideration for borders. In the recent past, we have witnessed outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, Chikungunya, and Zika [4] . With each new outbreak, lives are lost, and the world is placed on high alert. Lessons have been learned from the initial coverup and misidentification of the SARS pathogen in 2003 [5, 6] , and the recent slow response of the World Health Organization to the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak [7] . From this perspective, it is understandable that Chinese scientists cautiously released the identity and genome sequence of this new virus [3] . However, transparency on disease reporting to the public and data sharing with international colleagues must continue. With an increasing number of new cases of infection by the new coronavirus reported in China and neighboring countries, such as Japan and Thailand [8], human-to-human transmission should be thoroughly investigated.
0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c	A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R 0 -the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R 0 vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of R 0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation intervalḠ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. We then apply our framework to early estimates of R 0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early R 0 estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R 0 , including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate R 0 at the outset of an epidemic.
a73e544236588d55fca3340b9c62e40e6bb0ea93	Gastrointestinal tract involvement is a rare complication of plasma cell neoplasia. We present a case of non-secretory type primary plasma cell leukaemia (PCL) with multiple gastric involvement. Dual surface antigen analysis of bone marrow cells revealed that atypical plasma cells coexpressed CD38 and myeloid antigen CD13. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy disclosed multiple submucosal masses in the body of the stomach. Endoscopic biopsy specimens showed marked infiltration of atypical plasma cells consistent with a diagnosis of gastric involvement by PCL. Since CD13 antigen is identical to aminopeptidase N, a membrane-bound glycoprotein thought to be involved in the process of tumour invasion, CD13 expression on neoplastic plasma cells may be related to the gastric involvement in this patient.
0487d0e154f0ccede640b41cab10d76e9c2a87a3	The nasopharyngeal swab is currently the main testing method used to diagnose COVID-19. The principle is to collect respiratory cells infected by the virus and to use the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription -Polymerase Chain Reaction) technique to detect the RNA of the virus. The false negative rate is high, about 30%, which can mainly be explained by an incorrect execution of the technique may increase the false negative rate and decrease the test's sensitivity. The aim of this note is to help healthcare providers to perform this test correctly in adults and children.
981a43b9ee49c6ebc8dbb327b38a7ee6f279d87f	General medical training programs are aimed at promoting competency in general practice skills with a holistic perspective of patient-centered medicine for the new generation of physicians. The faculty development program was implemented to promote learning and application of the six core competencies established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. This article describes the implementation and outcome of the current faculty development program. Additional assessment tools of the faculty development program are recommended to evaluate different perspectives of outcome. Our experience suggests that OSTEs are a realistic and well-received approach for faculty development that merits further investigation. According to the clinical instructors' response, our faculty development program effectively increased familiarity with various teaching and assessment skills needed to teach PGY 1 residents and ACGME competencies, and these clinical instructors also then subsequently applied these skills.
f85b87d6ac0cb37ce1c1ffe67c055d1b55a44a8b	Objective: The recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and significant mortality. We aim here to identify the risk factors associated with mortality of coronavirus infected persons using a supervised machine learning approach. Research Design and Methods: Clinical data of 1085 cases of COVID-19 from 13 th January to 28 th February, 2020 was obtained from Kaggle, an online community of Data scientists. 430 cases were selected for the final analysis. Random Forest classification algorithm was implemented on the dataset to identify the important predictors and their effects on mortality. Results: The Area under the ROC curve obtained during model validation on the test dataset was 0.97. Age was the most important variable in predicting mortality followed by the time gap between symptom onset and hospitalization. Conclusions: Patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients.
e6dd11bf76e2c2bcb955c99f5b5a5bdd113ecb69	As a consequence of missing data on tests for infection and imperfect accuracy of tests, reported rates of cumulative population infection by the SARS CoV-2 virus are lower than actual rates of infection. Hence, reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context. We find that the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find that the infection fatality rate in Illinois, New York, and Italy is substantially lower than reported.
52d28d82e2265e869f72292bd07e1c083e0bebc9	To date, there has been little articulation of specific One Health clinical activities for veterinary and human health care providers regarding emerging infectious diseases, yet they could play a critical role. Under current clinical paradigms, both human and animal health professionals routinely diagnose and treat zoonotic infectious diseases in their patients, but tend to work in parallel with little cross-professional communication or coordination of care. For this to evolve toward a One Health model, both types of clinicians need to see how individual cases can be ''sentinel events'' indicating environmental risk for disease emergence, and develop mechanisms of rapid communication about these risks. Human and animal clinicians also need to take a more proactive and preventive approach to zoonotic diseases that includes the occupational health of animal workers in farms, laboratories, veterinary clinics, and other settings, as well as the recognition of increased risk among immunocompromised individuals in contact with animals. This requires training in One Health clinical competencies including the ability to diagnose and treat zoonotic diseases, implement preventive care interventions for individual patients, provide occupational health services for animal workers, recognize sentinel cases, report cases to public heath and clinical colleagues, and assess and help to intervene with environmental factors driving infectious disease risk in humans and animals. To provide an evidence base for such competency training, there is a need for development and testing of innovative protocols for One Health clinical collaborations.
6ddc2b6e3c19d389fa4a1956a88ec9d2b4a8dd99	MuseLearn is a platform that enhances the presentation of the exhibits of a museum with multimedia-rich content that is adapted and recommended for certain visitor profiles and playbacks on their mobile devices. The platform consists mainly of a content management system that stores and prepares multimedia material for the presentation of exhibits; a recommender system that monitors objectively the visitor's behavior so that it can further adapt the content to their needs; and a pose estimation system that identifies an exhibit and links it to the additional content that is prepared for it. We present the systems and the initial results for a selected set of exhibits in Herakleidon Museum, a museum holding temporary exhibitions mainly about ancient Greek technology. The initial evaluation that we presented is encouraging for all systems. Thus, the plan is to use the developed systems for all museum exhibits as well as to enhance their functionality.
610cdf0a90ee7272f51c5531375a7355768f865a	Viral protein synthesis is completely dependent upon the host cell's translational machinery. Canonical translation of host mRNAs depends on structural elements such as the 5 ′ cap structure and/or the 3 ′ poly(A) tail of the mRNAs. Although many viral mRNAs are devoid of one or both of these structures, they can still translate efficiently using non-canonical mechanisms. Here, we review the tools utilized by positive-sense single-stranded (+ss) RNA plant viruses to initiate non-canonical translation, focusing on cis-acting sequences present in viral mRNAs. We highlight how these elements may interact with host translation factors and speculate on their contribution for achieving translational control. We also describe other translation strategies used by plant viruses to optimize the usage of the coding capacity of their very compact genomes, including leaky scanning initiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon readthrough. Finally, future research perspectives on the unusual translational strategies of +ssRNA viruses are discussed, including parallelisms between viral and host mRNAs mechanisms of translation, particularly for host mRNAs which are translated under stress conditions.

cbacec17b09e3c2f5664368a56a23940d7d831cb	Background: Critical illness due to 2009 H1N1 influenza has been characterized by respiratory complications, including acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and associated with high mortality. We studied the severity, outcomes, and hospital charges of patients with ALI/ARDS secondary to pandemic influenza A infection compared with ALI and ARDS from other etiologies. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted that included patients admitted to the Cleveland Clinic MICU with ALI/ARDS and confirmed influenza A infection, and all patients admitted with ALI/ARDS from any other etiology from September 2009 to March 2010. An itemized list of individual hospital charges was obtained for each patient from the hospital billing office and organized by billing code into a database. Continuous data that were normally distributed are presented as the mean ± SD and were analyzed by the Student's t test. The chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate differences in proportions between patient subgroups. Data that were not normally distributed were compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: Forty-five patients were studied: 23 in the H1N1 group and 22 in the noninfluenza group. Mean ± SD age was similar (44 ± 13 and 51 ± 17 years, respectively, p = 0.15). H1N1 patients had lower APACHE III scores (66 ± 20 vs. 89 ± 32, p = 0.015) and had higher Pplat and PEEP on days 1, 3, and 14. Hospital and ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were comparable. SOFA scores over the first 2 weeks in the ICU indicate more severe organ failure in the noninfluenza group (p = 0.017). Hospital mortality was significantly higher in the noninfluenza group (77 vs. 39%, p = 0.016). The noninfluenza group tended to have higher overall charges, including significantly higher cost of blood products in the ICU. Conclusions: ALI/ARDS secondary to pandemic influenza infection is associated with more severe respiratory compromise but has lower overall acuity and better survival rates than ALI/ARDS due to other causes. Higher absolute charges in the noninfluenza group are likely due to underlying comorbid medical conditions.
f25fde80df624acbc1d0c9268aa7725a25036fb8	We propose a mathematical model based on probability theory to optimize COVID-19 testing by a multi-step batch testing approach with variable batch sizes. This model and simulation tool dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of the tests in a large population at a low cost. The proposed method combines statistical modeling with numerical methods to solve nonlinear equations and obtain optimal batch sizes at each step of tests, with the flexibility to incorporate geographic and demographic information. We also conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that our method reduces the false negative rate by 80%. Our method substantially improves the false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. The proposed method will be particularly useful for the prevention of a second wave of the coronavirus outbreaks, and more generally for the early stages of future pandemics. The proposed work will have broader impacts on medical testing for contagious diseases in general.
eeb09181c7e8cd16c5183bc520b3a2fe4fb946e4	Ten calves which had contracted acute diarrhoea caused by rotavirus, coronavirus and Cryptosporidium were used to test the hypothesis that feeding lactose-hydrolysed cow's milk instead of unprocessed cow's milk improves sugar absorption in diarrhoeic calves. The animals were rehydrated with an orally administered solution containing electrolytes and glucose. Thereafter the calves received one test meal of whole fresh cow's milk whose lactose had been hydrolysed by added lactase and one test meal of unprocessed cow's milk at an interval of 24 h in a cross-over design trial. In comparison with unprocessed milk, the intake of milk containing hydrolysed lactose resulted in a slight decrease of mean breath hydrogen concentration (P = 0.18), but also a slight decrease of mean blood galactose concentration (P = 0.14). There was no treatment effect on mean plasma glucose concentration. Peak plasma glucose and blood galactose concentration tended to be delayed after the intake of lactose-hydrolysed milk, which implies that gastric emptying was probably delayed. The results show that feeding milk which contains hydrolysed lactose does not significantly improve lactose utilization in calves that are suffering from benign infectious diarrhoea.
af266fac8970a7960e96630a67d91bec5dda0335	Estimating key infectious disease parameters from the COVID-19 outbreak is quintessential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies. Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution.

054c0f0243580931ab610cfdab99c3ef6ad2f186	Immigration legal services providers (ISPs) are a principal source of support for low-income immigrants seeking immigration benefits. Yet there is scant quantitative evidence on the prevalence and geographic distribution of ISPs in the United States. To fill this gap, we construct a comprehensive, nationwide database of 2,138 geocoded ISP offices that offer low-or no-cost legal services to low-income immigrants. We use spatial optimization methods to analyze the geographic network of ISPs and measure ISPs' proximity to the low-income immigrant population. Because both ISPs and immigrants are highly concentrated in major urban areas, most low-income immigrants live close to an ISP. However, we also find a sizable fraction of low-income immigrants in underserved areas, which are primarily in midsize cities in the South. This reflects both a general skew in non-governmental organization service provision and the more recent arrival of immigrants in these largely Southern destinations. Finally, our optimization analysis suggests significant gains from placing new ISPs in underserved areas to maximize the number of low-income immigrants who live near an ISP. Overall, our results provide vital information to immigrants, funders, and policymakers about the current state of the ISP network and opportunities to improve it.
b022afc799e4faea03c71335a62fbda966751dcf	In late 2019, a queer type of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan city in the central part of China. On investigation, it was found to be caused by the coronavirus. Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s. There are a total of seven types of coronaviruses that infect humans: 229E and NL63 are the alpha coronaviruses; OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV are beta coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus. COVID-19 surfaced in China at the culmination of the year 2019. The pandemic then fanned out rapidly, involving Italy, Japan, South Korea, Iran, and the rest of the world.

Developing simple, sensitive, and cost-effective tools that allow the rapid and accurate assembly and isolation of molecular biomarkers has the potential to improve both patient care and hospital logistic efficiency towards personalized and affordable treatments of diseases.In this work, we presenta method consisting ofUV-vis-spectroscopy assisted-magnetophoresis for the monitoring of DNA hybridization. For this purpose, a magnetic device generating 7.5 T/m uniform magnetic field gradient was designed and incorporated to a commercial spectrophotometer. Different batches of colloidal superparamagnetic particles (SMPs), with different elemental compositions, were functionalized with twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides, TB1 and TB2. When the functionalized SMPs-TB1 and SMPs-TB2 are mixed and incubated, the hybridization process of TB1 and TB2 occurs resulting in the formation of colloidal aggregates. When brought under the magnetic field, depending on the magnetic strength (Γ) of the formed aggregates, they separate either faster or slower than the non-functionalized SMPs. The difference in magnetic separation time (Δt) is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the suspension at specific wavelengths. The detection of aggregates at concentrations of 0.001% w/v was achieved, showing |Δt| ranging from 113−228 s. Based on the changes of Δt, the study addresses how electrosteric, magnetic, and hydrogen bonding interactions affect the hybridization process and suggests optimum experimental conditions for accurate monitoring of TB1-TB2 hybridization.
7b5eb3181315448503fbf8300becb7d3373414a9	The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in immunocompetent patients raises significant concern for immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). This level of concern, both on the part of the KTRs and transplant professionals, is heightened by a lack of prior knowledge on how SARS-CoV-2 may manifest differently in immunosuppressed patients. Characterizing how KTRs may present differently than the general population would allow for more targeted and timely evaluation and treatment of KTRs with COVID-19 infection. Methods: Without prior knowledge of how this virus would affect our transplant center's delivery of care to KTRs who are SARS-CoV-2 positive or Patients Under Investigation (PUIs), and in the setting of limited testing availability, we initiated a Quality Assurance and Improvement Project (QAPI) to track KTRs followed at our transplant center through the SARS-CoV-2 testing process. Results: Of the 53 symptomatic patients, 20 (38%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 either on presentation to the emergency department, or referral to a designated outpatient testing center. In addition, 16 (80%) of the 20 patients who tested positive required inpatient treatment. Intriguingly, patients with a history of polyoma BK viremia (BKV) had a higher incidence of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to patients without history of BKV (80% and 28%, respectively; p= 0.002). The Positive Predictive Value and Likelihood ratio was 80% and 6.6 for this association, respectively. Among our KTRs tested, those receiving belatacept had a lower likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. This finding approached, but did not achieve, statistical significance (p=0.06). Background:

In this review, the authors reveal practical aspects that are important during the COVID-19 pandemic with regards to the safe delivery of cardiac anesthesia. Timing for operations of the cardio-vascular system may be well programmed, in most cases. Hence, the level of priorities must be defined for any single patient. The postponement of surgery may be convenient for most cases, if it is made in the best interest of the patient. The preanesthetic evaluation should keep attention to the respiratory history of the patient. Cardiac anesthesia is always implying some respiratory monitoring; hence the existing clinical situation of the patient's respiratory system should be clear. In case of emergency surgery, the patient should be treated as if they potentially have or are at risk for the virus. In the case of a COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient, attention must be made to preserve operating room and team integrity. The machineries are to be draped with plastic, in order to simplify the disinfection after the operation. Perioperative management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients must strictly follow the most relevant international guidelines. This review article has synthesized the common aspect present in the most important of these.
e1a39658583a2c387c7c6d8d1a9227fad632a8c5	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses several challenges to the management of patients with leukemia. The biology of each leukemia and its corresponding treatment with conventional intensive chemotherapy, with or without targeted therapies (venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors, IDH1/2 inhibitors, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors), introduce additional layers of complexity during COVID-19 highrisk periods. The knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulating rapidly. An important distinction is the prevalence of "exposure" versus "clinical infectivity," which determine the risk versus benefit of modifying potentially highly curative therapies in leukemia. At present, the rate of clinical infection is < 1-2% worldwide. With a mortality rate of 1-5% in CO-VID-19 patients in the general population and potentially of > 30% in patients with cancer, careful consideration should be given to the risk of COVID-19 in leukemia. Instead of reducing patient access to specialized cancer centers and modifying therapies to ones with unproven curative benefit, there is more rationale for less intensive, yet effective therapies that may require fewer clinic visits or hospitalizations. Here, we offer recommendations on the optimization of leukemia management during high-risk COVID-19 periods.
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	Cystatins are thiol proteinase inhibitors (TPI), present ubiquitously in animals, plants and microorganisms. These are not merely inhibitors rather they are at heart of many pathological conditions ranging from diabetes to renal failure. These are essential for maintenance of protein balance of the cell; once this balance gets disturbed, it may lead to cell death. Thus, cystatins cannot be merely regarded as TPI's as these have been found to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies have reported the variation in cystatin level in incidences of different types of cancer; highlighting an important role played by these inhibitors in cancer development and progression. Cystatin C is increasingly replacing creatinine as a biomarker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) thereby highlighting the importance of this important inhibitor. Some recent studies have also reported the interaction pattern of various anti-cancer drugs with cystatins in a bid to find how these drugs affect this important inhibitors and whether these drugs have any side effect on cystatins. Thus, in this growing disease era it can be said that cystatins are no more just inhibitors blocking the activity of thiol proteases rather they play a pivotal role in variety of pathological conditions.

Pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccinations should be also provided to avoid superimposed pneumonia in patients affected by Covid-19. 2) maintaining social distancing and strengthening hygiene measures to prevent the spread of influenza and ILIs. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Given the airborne transmissibility of pathogens causing Influenza and ILIs [6], actions should be taken in order to prevent the spread of such infections by adoption of social distancing in both working and community settings. Hygiene measures (i.e. face masks and hand hygiene) should be adopted and strengthened, since they have been already proved effective to prevent influenza and ILIs; in particular: avoiding close contact with sick people, limiting contact with others while sick (by staying home for at least 24 hours after flu-like symptoms appear if needed), covering one's nose and mouth with a tissue while coughing or sneezing and throwing the tissue in the trash after use, keeping hands clean by regular washing with soap and water, avoiding touching mouth, nose, and eyes, and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces [7]. 3) protecting people recently affected by influenza or ILIs and, therefore, susceptible to COVID-19. In our study [2] we speculated previous influenza and ILI being a potential trojan horse for COVID-19; given this hypothesis, we suggest that, in addition to the well-known conditions of individual susceptibility for severe COVID-19 (i.e. advanced age, cardiac injury, COPD, immunodepression, cancer, etc.), recent influenza or ILI are other host risk factors to be considered. Therefore, we think that people recently affected by influenza or ILI should be considered as "fragile" for COVID-19 and strength protected from the infection.

cd4718d48c17834493c70d01ed2888bf53b75817	1 KLINISCHE PR AKTIJK E en ernstige infectie waarvan de oorzaak onduidelijk blijft, komt weinig voor. Bij de meeste patiënten met een dergelijke infectie werkt een empirische behandeling. Wij beschrijven een patiënt met encefalitis bij wie de maximale inzet van therapie niet hielp. De oorzaak van de infectie werd pas 2 maanden na zijn overlijden ontdekt. Dit kwam mede doordat een dergelijke infectie nog niet eerder in Nederland was beschreven. Toch betrof het geen exotisch micro-organisme, maar een vrij-levende amoebe die wereldwijd voorkomt in water en aarde. Deze infectie wordt beschouwd als zeldzaam, al kan het ziektebeeld eerder zijn gemist, omdat de verwekker maar bij weinig artsen bekend is. Patiënt A, een 41-jarige man, werd ingestuurd naar de Spoedeisende Hulp vanwege al 10 dagen bestaande hoofdpijn. De hoofdpijn begon geleidelijk, was zeurend en drukkend, en zat boven het rechter oog. Daarbij was hij misselijk en greep hij mis naar voorwerpen. Patiënt had een uitgebreide voorgeschiedenis. Zo maakte hij op zijn 23e een necrotiserende pancreatitis met sepsis door. Dit leidde tot terminaal nierfalen. 8 jaar later onderging hij een niertransplantatie, waarvoor hij langdurig immuunsuppressiva gebruikte en waarna hij diabetes mellitus ontwikkelde. Behalve een diabetisch voetulcus had hij geen infecties gehad. Patiënt gebruikte onder andere het immuunsuppressivum mycofenolaatmofetil, prednison, insuline, atenolol, losartan, atorva-Achtergrond Encefalitis die wordt veroorzaakt door een vrij-levende amoebe is relatief zeldzaam en verloopt meestal fataal. Dit komt omdat de diagnose vaak pas laat wordt gesteld en de behandeling moeizaam is. cAsus Een 41-jarige patiënt, met in de voorgeschiedenis een niertransplantatie, kwam naar de SEH met een encefalitisbeeld. Beeldvormend onderzoek van de hersenen liet diverse hypodensiteiten zien, die mogelijk abcessen waren. Hoewel een infectieuze oorzaak waarschijnlijk leek, had zelfs de meest uitgebreide antimicrobiële behandeling geen effect. Pas 2 maanden na het overlijden van patiënt werd de oorzaak gevonden: een infectie met Balamuthia mandrillaris. Om deze amoebe te kunnen detecteren werd een PCR-test verricht. conclusie Deze casus beschrijft de eerste patiënt in Nederland bij wie granulomateuze amoebe-encefalitis veroorzaakt door B. mandrillaris werd gediagnosticeerd. Amoeben kunnen de oorzaak zijn van encefalitis met een fulminant beloop of van encefalitis met een geleidelijke toename van symptomen, zonder effect van gebruikelijke anti-infectieuze therapie.

150f9bc1ec1ab991863c3c8c3adb45ec2c2651ed	1) Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak. Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2. The rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the OT studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles. It is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the NF-κB/Nrf2 pathways and IL-6/IL-1β expression. (3) Results: In experimental models and the few existent clinical studies, homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by OT was associated with a modulation of NF-κB/Nrf2 balance and IL-6 and IL-1β expression. These molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of OT against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. (4) Conclusions: The potential cytoprotective role of OT in the management of organ damage induced by COVID-19 merits further research. Controlled clinical trials are needed.
aed6af6e457e60fbbfa1813be7e7ac2ea6b5fed1	Background: Morbidity and mortality from respiratory infections are higher in resource-limited countries than developed countries, but limited studies have been conducted in resource-limited settings to examine pathogens from patients with acute respiratory infections. Influenza surveillance has been conducted in Zambia since 2008; however, only 4.3% of patients enrolled in 2011-2012 were positive for influenza. Therefore, we examined non-influenza respiratory pathogens in children with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Zambia, to estimate the scope of disease burden and determine commonly-identified respiratory pathogens. Methods: Two reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods (single and multiplex) were used to analyze nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected from SARI cases under five years of age from January 2011 through December 2012. All specimens were negative for influenza by rRT-PCR. The panel of singleplex reactions targeted seven viruses, while the multiplex assay targeted thirty-three bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Results: A set of 297 specimens were tested by singleplex rRT-PCR, and a different set of 199 were tested by multiplex rRT-PCR. Using the singleplex assay, 184/297 (61.9%) specimens were positive for one or more viruses. The most prevalent viruses were human rhinovirus (57/297; 19.2%), human adenovirus (50/297; 16.8%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (45/297; 15.2%). Using multiplex PCR, at least one virus was detected from 167/199 (83.9%) specimens, and at least one bacteria was detected from 197/199 (99.0%) specimens. Cytomegalovirus (415/199; 208.5%) and RSV (67/199; 33.7%) were the most commonly detected viruses, while Streptococcus pneumonie (109/199; 54.8%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (92/199; 46.2%) were the most commonly detected bacteria. Conclusions: Single infections and co-infections of many viruses and bacteria were identified in children with SARI. These results provide an estimate of the prevalence of infection and show which respiratory pathogens are commonly identified in patients. Further studies should investigate causal associations between individual pathogens and SARI.
507ec4769026bf913eec878987b8fb0c2f00756f	Purpose: To identify the prognostic factors for pulmonary metastasectomy (PM-ectomy) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with pulmonary metastases (PM) from HCC who had undergone curative PM-ectomy at National Taiwan University Hospital between 1990 and 2004. Univariate (log-rank) and multivariate (CoxÕs model) analyses of survival were used to identify the significant prognostic factors. Results: In total, 34 patients were eligible for curative PM-ectomy. The overall survival rates (Kaplan-Meier) after PM-ectomy were 65.2% and 27.5% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. High alpha-fetoprotein level, positive hepatic resection margin, and short disease-free interval (DFI) were unfavorable factors for overall survival from univariate analysis, however, only DFI (P = 0.028) was identified as an independently prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. Bilateral distribution and more PMs were unfavorable factors for PM-free survival from univariate analysis, with only PM number identified as an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis (P = 0.017). Conclusion: Patients with longer DFIs and fewer PMs can benefit from PM-ectomy in HCC.
1839d344ed15c61f2c26ae4d12cbdd617c7d0b5f	A goal of HIV vaccine development is to elicit antibodies with neutralizing breadth. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to HIV often have unusual sequences with long heavy-chain complementarity-determining region loops, high somatic mutation rates and polyreactivity. A subset of HIV-infected individuals develops such antibodies, but it is unclear whether this reflects systematic differences in their antibody repertoires or is a consequence of rare stochastic events involving individual clones.

1a9597a57cd6c3255a954c3a466dc211f5673382	We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a chimeric alphavirus vaccine candidate in mice with selective immunodeficiencies. This vaccine candidate was highly attenuated in mice with deficiencies in the B and T cell compartments, as well as in mice with deficient gamma-interferon responsiveness. However, the level of protection varied among the strains tested. Wild type mice were protected against lethal VEEV challenge. In contrast, alpha/beta (αβ) TCR-deficient mice developed lethal encephalitis following VEEV challenge, while mice deficient in gamma/delta ( γδ) T cells were protected. Surprisingly, the vaccine potency was diminished by 50% in animals lacking interferon-gamma receptor alpha chain (R1)-chain and a minority of vaccinated immunoglobulin heavy chain-deficient (μMT) mice survived challenge, which suggests that neutralizing antibody may not be absolutely required for protection. Prolonged replication of encephalitic VEEV in the brain of pre-immunized mice is not lethal and adoptive transfer experiments indicate that CD3 + T cells are required for protection.

There is a near complete absence of neurosurgeons in the rural communities in Nigeria with over 95% resident in urban area. Starting a neurosurgical services takes a huge sacrifice from the neurosurgeon who is faced with a decision to do something in the presence of a near absence of material and manpower, and in turn circumvent processes with extra burden so as to ensure he/she provides leadership with respect to patients care and assists in the training of allied surgeons and other healthcare staffs to mitigate against morbidity and mortality. Our research is aimed to highlight the total number of patients attended to in the neurosurgical unit, challenges, prospect, and future.
300183d862ef809c734535bb79928efa4cdcd208	The COVID-19 infections in Pakistan are spreading at an exponential rate and a point may soon be reached where rigorous prevention measures would need to be adopted. Mathematical models can help define the scale of an epidemic and the rate at which an infection can spread in a community. We used an SIR model to predict the magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan and compared the numbers with the reported cases on the national database. Our results indicate that Pakistan could hit peak number of infectious cases on May 26th, 2020 and by June 24th, 2020, 90% of the population will have become infected with the virus if policy interventions seeking to curb this infection are not adopted aggressively. Since the emergence of COVID-19, several mathematical models have been developed to simulate the rate of infection spread, infections per day and the resolution of the epidemic. The SIR model refers to the number of susceptible, infected and recovered cases during an epidemic at any given time. The model assumes that susceptible cases (S), infected cases (I) and .

In related SARS-CoV-1, 3a is implicated in viral release, inflammasome activation, and cell death and its deletion reduces viral titer and morbidity in animal models, suggesting 3a-targeted therapeutics could treat SARS and COVID-19. However, the structural basis for the function of 3a is unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 3a forms large conductance cation channels and present cryo-EM structures of dimeric and tetrameric 3a in lipid nanodiscs. 3a adopts a novel fold and is captured in a closed or inactivated state. A narrow bifurcated exterior pore precludes conduction and leads to a large polar cavity open to the cytosol. 3a function is conserved in a common variant among circulating SARS-CoV-2 that alters the channel pore. We identify 3a-like proteins in all Alphaand Beta-coronaviruses that infect bats and humans, suggesting therapeutics targeting 3a could treat a range of coronaviral diseases.
ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has devastated pig industries worldwide for many years. It is caused by a small RNA virus (PRRSV), which targets almost exclusively pig monocytes or macrophages. In the present study, five SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) libraries derived from 0 hour mock-infected and 6, 12, 16 and 24 hours PRRSVinfected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) produced a total 643,255 sequenced tags with 91,807 unique tags. Differentially expressed (DE) tags were then detected using the Bayesian framework followed by gene/mRNA assignment, arbitrary selection and manual annotation, which determined 699 DE genes for reactome analysis. The DAVID, KEGG and REACTOME databases assigned 573 of the DE genes into six biological systems, 60 functional categories and 504 pathways. The six systems are: cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, metabolism, organismal systems and human diseases as defined by KEGG with modification. Self-organizing map (SOM) analysis further grouped these 699 DE genes into ten clusters, reflecting their expression trends along these five time points. Based on the number one functional category in each system, cell growth and death, transcription processes, signal transductions, energy metabolism, immune system and infectious diseases formed the major reactomes of PAMs responding to PRRSV infection. Our investigation also focused on dominant pathways that had at least 20 DE genes identified, multi-pathway genes that were involved in 10 or more pathways and exclusively-expressed genes that were included in one system. Overall, our present study reported a large set of DE genes, compiled a comprehensive coverage of pathways, and revealed systembased reactomes of PAMs infected with PRRSV. We believe that our reactome data provides new insight into molecular mechanisms involved in host genetic complexity of antiviral activities against PRRSV and lays a strong foundation for vaccine development to control PRRS incidence in pigs.
266638c157eeaa50a5be5c734ed71240faeafe93	Background: The major infectious diseases of hepatitis B has constituted an acute public health challenge in China. An effective and affordable HBV control model is urgently needed. A national project of Community-based Collaborative Innovation HBV (CCI-HBV) demonstration areas has optimized the existing community healthcare resources and obtained initial results in HBV control. Methods: Based on the existing community healthcare network, CCI-HBV project combined the community health management and health contract signing service for long-staying residents in hepatitis B screening. Moreover, HBV field research strategy was popularized in CCI-HBV areas. After screening, patients with seropositive results were enrolled in corresponding cohorts and received treatment at an early stage. And the uninfected people received medical supports including health education through new media, behavior intervention and HBV vaccinations. In this process, a cloud-based National Information Platform (NIP) was established to collect and store residents' epidemiological data. In addition, a special quality control team was set up for CCI project. Results: After two rounds of screening, HBsAg positive rate dropped from 5.05% (with 5,173,003 people screened) to 4.57% (with 3,819,675 people screened), while the rate of new HBV infections was 0.28 per 100 person-years in the fixed cohorts of 2,584,322 people. The quality control team completed PPS sampling simultaneously and established the serum sample database with 2,800,000 serum samples for unified testing.
85544c40199592db3f81823f341f19f303fef7ec	Beijing, China from 2015 to 2017. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected from 30 sentinel hospitals in Beijing and subjected to EV and EV-D68 detection by real-time PCR. The VP1 gene region and complete genome sequences of EV-D68 positive cases were analyzed. Of 21816 ARTI cases, 619 (2.84%) were EV positive and 42 cases were EV-D68 positive. The detection rates of EV-D68 were 0 (0/6644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7650) in 2017, respectively. Two peaks of EV-D68 infections occurred in late summer and early-winter. Ten cases (23.81%) with upper respiratory tract infection and 32 cases (76.19%) presented with pneumonia, including 3 cases with severe pneumonia. The phylogenetic analysis suggested 15 subclade D3 strains and 27 subclade B3 strains of EV-D68 were circulated in China from 2016 to 2017. A total of 52 amino acid polymorphisms were identified between subclades D1 and D3. These data suggest an upsurge of EV-D68 occurred in Beijing in 2016, the new subclade D3 emerged in 2016 and co-circulated with subclade B3 between 2016 and 2017. Enteroviruses (EV) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA in the family Picornaviridae 1,2 . The length of enteroviruses is approximately 7.5 kilobases, and divided into 15 species (EV-A to L and rhinovirus A to C) 3-6 . Seven species, including EV-A to D and rhinovirus (RV) A to C, caused a wide spectrum of diseases in human 7,8 . Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a member of the species EV-D, was first identified from bronchiolitis and pneumonia in California in 1962 9 . EV-D68 infections have been rarely reported until the worldwide outbreaks 10-18 . A nationwide outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory tract infection was reported in the USA from mid-August 2014 to January 15, 2015 and 1,153 cases were confirmed with clinical characteristics of patients mainly resembling pneumonia with severe dyspnea syndrome during this epidemic 19 . In China, sporadic cases of EV-D68 were reported between 2006 and 2014 13,20-23 . The similar results were found that few patients confirmed with EV-D68 infections during the surveillance among US 24 , China 21 in 2015. However, an upsurge of EV-D68 infections occurred in 2016, ranging from Europe to North America, including Netherlands, France, Sweden and United states 24-27 . In addition, sporadic cases have been reported in Hong Kong, Italy, Germany, Portugal and UK in 2016 28, 29 . Earlier phylogenetic analysis revealed that EV-D68 strains circulating worldwide during 1961-2013 were divided into three clades (clades A to C) or lineages (lineages 1 to 3) 10,11,29-31 . With the deepening of the study, the clades of EV-D68 were further refined. After the outbreak of the United States in 2014, EV-D68 was grouped into four clades and five subclades, including clade A, clade B (subclades B1 to B3), clade C and clade D (subclades D1 to D2) 32,33 . The subclade B1 and B3, as the major subclade, circulated around the world in 2014 and in 2016, respectively. To raise awareness of this upsurge of EV-D68 infection, we performed an EV-D68 surveillance study on ARTI cases from the Respiratory Virus Surveillance System (RVSS) in Beijing and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of EV-D68 infections from 2015 to 2017 in Beijing. Results A total of 21, 816 ARTI cases were collected from RVSS from January 2015 to December 2017. The median age of them was 36 years old (range: 1 day to 101 years). Among 21, 816 cases, 619 (2.84%) cases were enterovirus positive and 42 (0.19%) cases were EV-D68 positive. 359 cases were successfully amplified among 619 enterovirus positive cases, including 326 cases belonging to EV-A to D, 26 cases and 7 cases belonging to RV-A and RV-C respectively, and no case belonging to RV-B. Of 326 cases belonging to EV-A to D, they were genotyped to 30 serotypes including 9 of EV-A, 16 of EV-B, 4 of EV-C and 1 of EV-D and the dominant serotypes were CVA6, EV-D68, CVA4, CVA2, CVA10, CVA5 and CVA12, accounting for 16.27%, 12.88%, 11.83%, 11.54%, 8.28%, 5.62% and 5.03%, respectively (Fig. 1) . No samples of EV-D68 co-infected with other enteroviruses were found. The annual detection rates of EV-D68 were 0 (0/6, 644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7, 522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7, 650) in 2017, respectively (Table 1) . Twenty cases were aged younger than 18 years, 15 were aged 18 to 60 years and 7 were aged over 60 years. No statistically significant difference of EV-D68 positive rates was identified in the different age groups in 2016 (P = 0.062). Statistical analysis. The differences of EV-D68 positive cases among different age groups were performed using chi-square test. The comparison of EV-D68 different subclades proportions in different age groups were performed using fisher's exact test. The comparison of respiratory diseases by different subclades of EV-D68 were performed using fisher's exact test. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 17.0.
9da31d3a605927d64311c2f59c22e80fc48e3839	Antiviral activities of a recombinant feline interferon (rFeIFN) KT-80 were evaluated against feline enteropathogenic viruses in feline and canine cell lines. Sensitivity to antiviral activities of the rFelFN varied with cell types; Felis cams whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells were more sensitive than Crandell feline kidney cells, but no sensitivity was found for Madin-Darby canine kidney cells when vesicular stomatitis virus was used as a challenge virus. Reductions were generally IFN dose-dependent and were more consistent when the cells were continuously treated with the rFelFN than when they were pretreated only before viral challenge. Compared with each virus control culture of fcwf-4 cells, yields of rotavirus, feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), feline calicivirus and feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus were reduced by ranges of 1.3 to ~< 3.1 loglo, 0.6 to 1.6 log2, 0.8 to 3.7 log~o and 0.5 to 0.6 log~o, respectively, in the cultures continuously treated with 10 to 10000 U of the rFelFN. The yield reduction of FPLV was considered to be in part attributable to inhibition of cell growth by the rFeIFN supplemented in the medium.
233ce2cb87493d1003d08455a0ff230013489d0f	Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly in the last decade and continue to develop in terms of dimension and complexity offering wide range of devices to support diverse set of applications. With ubiquitous Internet, connected sensors and actuators, networking and communication technology, and artificial intelligence (AI), smart cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide services rendering assistance to humans in their daily lives. However, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic has exposed and highlighted the limitations of current technological deployments to curtail this disease. IoT and smart connected technologies together with data-driven applications can play a crucial role not only in prevention, continuous monitoring, and mitigation of the disease, but also enable prompt enforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks. In this paper, we envision an IoT-enabled ecosystem for intelligent monitoring, proactive prevention and control, and mitigation of COVID-19. We propose different architectures, applications and technology systems for various smart infrastructures including E-health, smart home, smart supply chain management, smart locality, and smart city, to develop future connected communities to manage and mitigate similar outbreaks. Furthermore, we present research challenges together with future directions to enable and develop these smart communities and infrastructures to fight and prepare against such outbreaks. and identified 9,661 positive cases. Taiwan 7 leveraged database from national health insurance and integrated it with its immigration and customs database to begin the creation of big data for analytics, and generated real-time alerts during a clinical visit based on travel history and clinical symptoms to aid case identification. Similarly, Chinese government 8 installed CCTV cameras at home or apartment door of those under a quarantine period to monitor the patient activity. Drones are used to notify people to wear their masks, and digital barcodes on mobile apps highlight the health status of individuals. Researchers at the University of Michigan together with the team at Voxel51 9 have presented the Physical Distancing Index (PDI) to help track how COVID-19 news or events impact human activity around the globe in real time. The free AI-powered interactive tool enables users to explore a day-by-day timeline of social activity in some of the world's most populated areas to track social distancing behaviors. Currently, Voxel51 gathers and analyzes historical and real time video streams from public street cameras in Ann Arbor, Detroit, Times Square; Abbey Road in London; Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas; Seaside Heights in New Jersey; a beach in Ft. Lauderdale; and intersections in Dublin and Prague. In the United States, 13% positive cases belong to New York 10 , which has became the battlefront. The fatality rate of this city is 11% as of May 10, and 0.5% of fatalities have been in nursing homes. Nursing homes are the most vulnerable spot in terms of health risks. Technology can assist in enforcing the prevention measures and mitigation strategies in nursing homes to flatten the curve of fatality rate. Some states Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Texas have partially reopened, and the models 11 have predicted that the number of cases and fatalities will increase as the country moves towards reopening businesses and cities. These evidences show that communities are not prepared to reopen, operate, and handle such pandemics. There are several requirements to assist in tracking and monitoring COVID-19 patients, such as enforcing proper sanitizing, social distancing, mass quarantine for mild-symptoms people, and testing at large scale for early detection. According to Harvard Global Health Institute 12 , 31 states in United States have insufficient testing levels, and 10 states would need at least 10,000 more tests a day to begin a gradual reopening. For example, New York, the state with the largest number of cases, would need to increase testing by more than 10,000 per day. Due to lack of enough testing kits, an antibody test online is offered for those people who recently got sick and think that they might have

93b0077bb11f6325fe62ea73f92250f3585872c1	Background: Enteroviruses are the most common causative agents of human illness. Enteroviruses have been associated with regional and global epidemics, recently, including with severe disease (Enterovirus A71 and D68), and are of interest as emerging viruses. Here, we typed Enterovirus A-D (EV) from central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory infections in Viet Nam. Methods: Data and specimens from prospective observational clinical studies conducted between 1997 and 2010 were used. Species and serotypes were determined using type-specific RT-PCR and viral protein 1 or 4 (VP1, VP4) sequencing. Results: Samples from patients with CNS infection (51 children -10 CSF and 41 respiratory/rectal swabs) and 28 adults (28 CSF) and respiratory infection (124 children -124 respiratory swabs) were analysed. Twenty-six different serotypes of the four Enterovirus species (A-D) were identified, including EV-A71 and EV-D68. Enterovirus B was associated with viral meningitis in children and adults. Hand, foot and mouth disease associated Enteroviruses A (EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus [CV] A10) were detected in children with encephalitis. Diverse serotypes of all four Enterovirus species were found in respiratory samples, including 2 polio-vaccine viruses, but also 8 CV-A24 and 8 EV-D68. With the exception of EV-D68, the relevance of these viruses in respiratory infection remains unknown. We describe the diverse spectrum of enteroviruses from patients with CNS and respiratory infections in Viet Nam between 1997 and 2010. These data confirm the global circulation of Enterovirus genera and their associations and are important for clinical diagnostics, patient management, and outbreak response.
156ec194f388fab04aff7ad38c14648b2d44c112	What is the key question: Do race and ethnic disparities exist in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and how can these disparities be explained? What is the bottom line: African American race and Hispanic ethnicity are associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially mediated by residence in high population density areas. We provide novel estimates of higher likelihood of race and ethnic disparities in susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 infection from a large heterogenous metropolitan in the U.S. Introduction: Data on race and ethnic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited. We analyzed socio-demographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore mediating pathways for race disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: Cross sectional analysis of COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR), which captures data for a large healthcare system comprising of one central tertiary care, seven large community hospitals, and an expansive ambulatory / emergency care network in the Greater Houston area. Nasopharyngeal samples for individuals inclusive of all ages, races, ethnicities and sex were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed, socio-demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, household income, residence population density) and comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease) factors. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to provide adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) for likelihood of positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework was utilized to explore three mediation pathways (low income, high population density, high comorbidity burden) for association between African American race and SARS-CoV-2 infection. : Among 4,513 tested individuals, 754 (16.7%) tested positive. Overall mean (SD) age was 50.6 (18.9) years, 62% females and 26% were African American. African American race was associated with lower socio-economic status, higher comorbidity burden, and population density residence. In the fully adjusted model, African American race (vs. White; aOR, CI: 1.84, 1.49-2.27) and Hispanic ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic; aOR, CI: 1.70, 1.35-2.14) had a higher likelihood of infection. Older individuals and males were also at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SEM framework demonstrated a statistically significant (p = 0.008) indirect effect code household income, insurance type, zip population density and comorbidities) in our final multivariable model. We assessed the model fit utilizing the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test and crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR and aOR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Age, income and population density variables were categorized to improve model fit. Post-estimation marginal probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection were determined from the fully adjusted model for major covariates (race, ethnicity and age). A comorbidity burden score was calculated by assigning one point each for presence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity or a combination of Coronary Artery Disease / Myocardial Infarction / Congestive Heart Failure (CAD / MI / CHF). We explored the mediation influence of comorbidity burden, socio-economic status (median income), and lack of social distancing (population density) on the relationship between African American race and high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Generalized Structural Equation Modeling (GSEM) framework. The GSEM framework was set up to provide estimates of direct and indirect effect of African American race on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) indirect effects represent full or partial mediation by a tested covariate. We included all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 across our healthcare system and did not perform formal sample size calculations. Patient and public involvement: There was no direct patient involvement in the design and conduct of this study. From the HM CURATOR, during an approximate 5-week (37-day) time period, we identified a total of 4,513 presumed cases tested for SARS-CoV-2, among whom 754 (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.6 -17.8) tested positive. Figure 1 represents temporal course of total, positive, and negative SARS-CoV-2 tests across the 37-day timeline in our hospital system.
b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770	Background: Inappropriate use of antibiotics increases resistance and reduces their effectiveness. Despite evidencebased guidelines, antibiotics are still commonly used to treat infections likely caused by respiratory viruses. In this study, we examined the temporal relationships between antibiotic usage and respiratory infections in the Republic of Korea. Methods: The number of monthly antibiotic prescriptions and the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections between 2010 and 2015 at all primary care clinics were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The monthly detection rates of respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, human coronavirus, and human rhinovirus, were collected from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cross-correlation analysis was conducted to quantify the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and respiratory virus activities as well as respiratory infections in primary clinics. Results: The monthly use of different classes of antibiotic, including penicillins, other beta-lactam antibacterials, macrolides and quinolones, was significantly correlated with influenza virus activity. These correlations peaked at the 0-month lag with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.45 (p < 0.01), 0.46 (p < 0.01), 0.40 (p < 0.01), and 0.35 (< 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between acute bronchitis and antibiotics, including penicillin (0.73, p < 0.01), macrolides (0.74, p < 0.01), and quinolones (0.45, p < 0.01), at the 0-month lag. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a significant temporal relationship between influenza virus activity and antibiotic use in primary clinics. This relationship indicates that interventions aimed at reducing influenza cases in addition to effort to discourage the prescription of antibiotics by physicians may help to decrease unnecessary antibiotic consumption.
efde489f714f11bc87ce338652add37531b65ad9	RT-LAMP detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown as a valuable approach to scale up COVID-19 diagnostics and thus contribute to limiting the spread of the disease. Here we present the optimization of highly cost-effective in-house produced enzymes, and we benchmark their performance against commercial alternatives. We explore the compatibility between multiple DNA polymerases with high strand-displacement activity and thermostable reverse transcriptases required for RT-LAMP. We optimize reaction conditions and demonstrate their applicability using both synthetic RNA and clinical patient samples. Finally, we validated the optimized RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw nasopharyngeal samples from 184 patients. We anticipate that optimized and affordable reagents for RT-LAMP will facilitate the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing globally, especially in sites and settings with limited economic resources.
2c5c896fb57b4bd8bec47dc52cc7ed9ff62d58a4	Sustainability certification schemes such as FAIRTRADE, FLO, WFTO and FT-USA have gained increasing markets. The significant growth of the fair trade (FT) movement in the last decades draws attention to ethical consumption. FT's aim at improving the livelihoods of producers in developing countries and promotion of social change is considered a model that shows the benefits of trade to development. Although conveying a large number of publications, not all questions about the movement are explored. The literature is prolific on coffee, cacao, flowers, wine, and gold. In contrast, the engagement with staple foods -a prominent globally traded food category -seems minor. The primary objective of this review was to map the existing literature about FT and staple foods; then, to investigate the role of staple foods in the FT movement. The search strategy was designed to retrieve publications on the intersection of FT and staple foods. To date, there is no review about FT and staple foods nexus. Our systematic review addressed this gap considering FT as an alternative capable of addressing unsustainable food consumption and production impacts. Our research protocol included keywords searching across four databases, screening, and comparative analysis. From 283 documents retrieved, 49 were deemed relevant to reflect the role of staple foods in the FT movement. This systematic review discusses challenges and opportunities for the FT model to further engage with staples and recommends improvement of its environmental credentials. The present study can contribute by informing decision makers, policy makers, businesses, NGOs, producers, and consumers.
16e0d6a1e48d067c51d6142249d852696ff9adc4	The peak of the daily new infections in COVID-19 remained qualitative in description and elusive in arrival. Because of the lack of clarity in what to expect from the peak, apart from the hope that one day the peak will be reached, there has been no metric to describe the success of the implemented strategies. We propose a way of predicting the number of infections that can be expected after a lockdown, assuming they come from the asymptomatic cases prior to the lockdown and using linear response theory. These predictions for several western countries faithfully follow the observed infections for several weeks after the lockdown, suggesting universalities in the recovery pattern of several countries. At the same time, the gap between the quantitative predictions of the recovery patterns for New York and Milan and the observations is striking. These gaps which arise even while emulating the recovery patterns of other western countries raise the possibility of an audit of the success of the implemented strategies, and the potential newer sources of infection.
c1f8df65b2c0cc3ead7d7bcf94732cc68b472e64	The interferon (IFN) response is a powerful system that was evolutionarily acquired by vertebrates including mammals to protect against viral infection. The cytoplasmic RNA helicases, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), were discovered in 2004 as viral sensors that trigger the antiviral IFN response by recognizing the nonself signatures of viral RNAs. The mechanisms underlying the recognition of viral RNAs and signal transduction leading to the production of type I IFN have been intensively studied following the discovery of RLRs. Moreover, a dysregulation in the expression of RLR or aberrant RLR signaling has been implicated in the development of a number of autoimmune diseases. We herein provide an overview of recent advances in RLR research and discussed future directions.
