d55c31191018d29b21fd07ed2c3a1c4b63dbe174	Human rhinovirus-C (HRV-C) has been increasingly detected in patients with acute respiratory diseases (ARDs). Prolonged surveillance was performed on children with ARD to investigate the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of HRV in Chongqing, China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with ARD during 2009-2012. HRV-C was genotyped by sequencing the VP4/VP2 coding region. Among the 1,567 NPAs obtained, 223 (14.2%) were HRV positive, and 75.3% of these 223 NPAs were co-infected with other viruses. HRV-A (54.7%) and HRV-C (39.9%) accounted for the majority of HRV infections. Logistic regression models demonstrated significant associations between HRV-A, HRV-C, and asthma attacks, as well as between HRV-C and wheezing. A phylogenetic tree showed that HRV-C2 was the predominant type of HRV-C, followed by HRV-C43, HRV-C1, and HRV-C17. Three novel genotypes were proposed on the basis of a low identity with the known HRVs. Our results showed that HRV-A and HRV-C were the predominant types of HRV infection, and HRV-C showed a high genetic variation in Chongqing, China. HRV infection was associated with asthma attacks and wheezing; furthermore, HRV infections played a minor role in causing severe pneumonia. This knowledge provides information for the prevention and control of HRV associated with ARDs.
dee7baf2d8f9fa1e70aac5ff68f1403dc663767a	Background: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) continues to be great challenge in calf rearing units. The urgent need to decrease the use of antibiotics and increase animal welfare in beef production has forced us to introduce new preventive methods. Vaccinations could contribute to the solution, but the high incidence of BRD already at an early age has made it difficult to introduce suitable vaccination programs. Challenge studies have shown promising results in 3-14 day old calves vaccinated with intranasal BRD vaccine, but very few field trials are available to assess the efficacy of the intranasal vaccines in field conditions. We evaluated the effect of one dose of commercial intranasal vaccination on calf mortality, daily gain, and treatment incidence for BRD in one calf rearing unit. In total, 497 calves (mean age 19 days) were included in our study, 247 of which were vaccinated at the time of arrival to the unit and 250 served as negative controls (unvaccinated). Vaccinated and unvaccinated calves were situated in separate compartments until weaning. Daily gain, treatment incidence, and mortality were recorded until the calves were transported to the finishing unit, which averaged 154.5 days from arrival. Results: Average daily gain over the complete study period was 1151.9 g/day (SD 137.9) for the vaccinated calves and 1139.5 g/day (SD 135.9) for the unvaccinated calves. Intranasal vaccination combined with older arrival age (17 days or older) resulted in a higher daily gain (47.8 g/day) compared with unvaccinated calves (coef. 0.0478, p = 0.003). This association was not recorded in calves that were younger than 17 days upon arrival. Intranasal vaccination was not significantly associated either with mortality (OR 0.976, p = 0.968) or treatment incidence for BRD (OR 1.341, p = 0.120). In total, six vaccinated calves (2.43%) and six unvaccinated calves (2.40%) died during the study period. Conclusions: Vaccinating arriving calves with intranasal vaccine in the calf rearing unit did not decrease the mortality or treatment incidence for BRD, but it significantly improved the weight gain in calves transported to the unit at the age of 17 days or older.
acb470a7f8d734e4f257454a90cbb1d933d8bebf	Antiviral defense in the liver during acute infection with the hepatotropic virus murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) involves complex cytokine and cellular interactions. However, the mechanism of viral sensing in the liver that promotes these cytokine and cellular responses has remained unclear. Studies here were undertaken to investigate the role of nucleic acidsensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in initiating antiviral immunity in the liver during infection with MCMV. We examined the host response of UNC93B1 mutant mice, which do not signal properly through TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9, to acute MCMV infection to determine whether liver antiviral defense depends on signaling through these molecules. Infection of UNC93B1 mutant mice revealed reduced production of systemic and liver proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-a, IFN-c, IL-12 and TNF-a when compared to wild-type. UNC93B1 deficiency also contributed to a transient hepatitis later in acute infection, evidenced by augmented liver pathology and elevated systemic alanine aminotransferase levels. Moreover, viral clearance was impaired in UNC93B1 mutant mice, despite intact virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the liver. Altogether, these results suggest a combined role for nucleic acid-sensing TLRs in promoting early liver antiviral defense during MCMV infection.

2bf8ae683ef919a724c5623efda3a71110d57ddd	IFIT proteins are interferon-inducible, innate immune effector molecules that are thought to confer antiviral defence through disruption of protein-protein interactions in the host translation initiation machinery. However, recently it was discovered that IFITs could directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5′-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here, we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an N-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double stranded viral PPP-RNA, RIG-I. Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a nonsequence specific manner and requires approximately a 3-nucleotide 5′-overhang. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 were found to cause a defect in the anti-viral response by HEK cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA and lend insight into their downstream effector function.
46e5064094ed75015cad5a226c704a0dc21b15c1	Recent advances in the diagnostic and metagenomic investigations of the feline enteric environment have allowed the identification of several novel viruses that have been associated with gastroenteritis in cats. In the last few years, noroviruses, kobuviruses, and novel parvoviruses have been repetitively detected in diarrheic cats as alone or in mixed infections with other pathogens, raising a number of questions, with particular regards to their pathogenic attitude and clinical impact. In the present article, the current available literature on novel potential feline enteric viruses is reviewed, providing a meaningful update on the etiology, epidemiologic, pathogenetic, clinical, and diagnostic aspects of the infections caused by these pathogens.
f50562c5a5e9f206dba3c559e6b4f5b65aadf7f4	A 21-year-old man presented with nasal obstruction of the right nasal fossa of 1 year duration. Nasal endoscopy revealed in the right inferior turbinate head a rounded neoplasm about 1 cm in diameter. Cytologic study of a nasal scraping specimen disclosed numerous clusters containing columnar cells with cytomegaly, prominent multinucleation, markedly sparse shortened cilia; the cytoplasm contained an acidophil area and a small round area that stained poorly; cells with a large intracytoplasmic vacuole that was acidophil and PAS+. Serology tests using the nested polymer chain reaction (PCR) technique on serum, nasal and pharyngeal smears revealed an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection that was confirmed at electron microscopy. The clinical and cytological features resolved 19 months after the initial evaluation. The authors advise carrying out clinical (endoscopy, serology, etc.) evaluation of all endonasal neoplasms and to routinely perform cytological study on nasal scraping specimens. When samples test positive for EBV, nasal and nasopharyngeal endoscopy should be performed regularly to detect possible evidence for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
33bf989feabff5e78b735d5b00fd210382df755e	Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA viruses that can emerge from endemic reservoirs and infect zoonotically, causing significant morbidity and mortality. CoVs encode an endoribonuclease designated EndoU that facilitates evasion of host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, but the target of EndoU activity was not known. Here, we report that EndoU cleaves the 5′-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA, which is the product of polyA-templated RNA synthesis. Using a virus containing an EndoU catalytic-inactive mutation, we detected a higher abundance of PUN RNA in the cytoplasm compared to wildtype−infected cells. Furthermore, we found that transfecting PUN RNA into cells stimulates a robust, MDA5-dependent interferon response, and that removal of the polyuridine extension on the RNA dampens the response. Overall, the results of this study reveal the PUN RNA to be a CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). We also establish a mechanism for EndoU activity to cleave and limit the accumulation of this PAMP. Since EndoU activity is highly conserved in all CoVs, inhibiting this activity may serve as an approach for therapeutic interventions against existing and emerging CoV infections. C oronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The positivesense virion RNA is translated to generate the viral replication machinery, which then replicates the positive-sense RNA into negative-sense, genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). The negative-sense RNAs then function as templates for synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA and sgRNA (1, 2). This replication strategy can generate long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates (3), that may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (4, 5). The specific PRR that recognizes CoV RNA is MDA5, which can activate the type I interferon (IFN) response in macrophages (6). Other host dsRNA PRRs, such as PKR and OAS, are also activated and operate to limit CoV replication (7-11). CoVs encode multiple proteins that antagonize these innate immune responses, particularly the activation of the IFN response (9, 12-16), ultimately leading to a dysregulated immune response and increased immunopathogenesis (17, 18). Understanding the mechanisms used by CoVs to delay IFN signaling may provide opportunities for the development of antivirals and live-attenuated vaccines to limit CoV infections. Here, we investigate the mechanism used by one CoV IFN antagonist, the nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), which is an endoribonuclease designated EndoU. EndoU is highly conserved in all known CoVs (19, 20) . EndoU is similar to the cellular endoribonuclease XendoU, as revealed by bioinformatic analysis of the amino acid sequence (21). X-ray structures of EndoU revealed conserved endoribonuclease folds with catalytic histidine residues required for endoribonuclease activity (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Purified EndoU was shown to cleave single-stranded RNA and dsRNA at uridine residues in in vitro assays (22, 25, (27) (28) (29) (30) . However, the target of EndoU activity during viral infection was unknown. Initial studies revealed that EndoU colocalizes with the viral replication complex (31, 32), and it was suggested that EndoU was necessary for efficient virus RNA replication in cell culture (28, 29) . More recent findings, however, revealed that EndoU catalytic mutant (EndoUmut) viruses replicate as well as wild-type virus in IFN-nonresponsive cells, but are severely impaired for replication in IFN-responsive macrophages (10, 11). These recent results revealed that EndoU activity is important for limiting the sensing of viral RNA by host dsRNA sensors such as MDA5, PKR, and OAS/RNaseL. Limiting viral RNA recognition contributes to delayed type I IFN responses; thus viruses with intact EndoU activity are more virulent than their EndoU-mutant counterparts (10, 11, 20) . In this study, we show that CoV EndoU activity limits the abundance and length of the polyuridine (polyU) extension on 5′-polyU-containing, negative-sense (PUN) RNAs for both the beta-CoV mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) and the alpha-CoV PEDV. Importantly, we found that the PUN RNAs can act as PAMPs recognized by MDA5. Overall, we propose a mechanism for EndoU, which is to cleave polyU sequences from PUN RNAs, thus limiting the formation of a PAMP and impeding the ability of MDA5 to activate the innate immune response to infection.
a58e8f6574084d5b03fc98bada5516acf68c19ef	Modeling of infectious diseases is essential to comprehend dynamic behavior for the transmission of an epidemic. This research study consists of a newly proposed mathematical system for transmission dynamics of the measles epidemic. The measles system is based upon mass action principle wherein human population is divided into five mutually disjoint compartments: susceptible Using real measles cases reported from January 2019 to October 2019 in Pakistan, the system has been validated. Two unique equilibria called measles-free and endemic (measles-present) are shown to be locally asymptotically stable for basic reproductive number R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1, respectively. While using Lyapunov functions, the equilibria are found to be globally asymptotically stable under the former conditions on R 0 . However, backward bifurcation shows coexistence of stable endemic equilibrium with a stable measles-free equilibrium for R 0 < 1. A strategy for measles control based on herd immunity is presented. The forward sensitivity indices for R 0 are also computed with respect to the estimated and fitted biological parameters. Finally, numerical simulations exhibit dynamical behavior of the measles system under influence of its parameters which further suggest improvement in both the vaccine efficacy and its coverage rate for substantial reduction in the measles epidemic.

41a504717108158f8d53a47619ae2ef5e04f6a8a	Invertebrates are hosts to diverse RNA viruses that have all possible types of encapsidated genomes (positive, negative and ambisense single stranded RNA genomes, or a double stranded RNA genome). These viruses also differ markedly in virion morphology and genome structure. Invertebrate RNA viruses are present in three out of four currently recognized orders of RNA viruses: Mononegavirales, Nidovirales, and Picornavirales, and 10 out of 37 RNA virus families that have yet to be assigned to an order. This mini-review describes general properties of the taxonomic groups, which include invertebrate RNA viruses on the basis of their current classification by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).

c4605351a6f163494f4d470cbc57eb2194af2ca1	We have previously reported the generation of the attenuated KNU-141112-S DEL5/ORF3 virus by continuous propagation of highly virulent G2b porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Vero cells. The present study aimed to assess the safety of S DEL5/ORF3 and to evaluate its effectiveness as a live vaccine for prime-booster vaccinations. Reversion to virulence experiments revealed that the S DEL5/ORF3 strain retains its attenuated phenotype and genetic stability after five successive passages in susceptible piglets. Pregnant sows were primed orally with an S DEL5/ORF3 live vaccine and boosted intramuscularly twice with a commercial killed vaccine at 2-week intervals prior to parturition. This sow vaccination regimen completely protected nursing piglets against virulent G2b challenge, as evidenced by the increase in survival rate from 0% to 100% and the significant reduction in diarrhea intensity, including the amount and duration of PEDV fecal shedding. In addition, despite a 2-3 day period of weight loss in piglets from vaccinated sows after challenge, their daily weight gain was recovered at 7 days post-challenge and became similar to that of unchallenged pigs from unvaccinated sows over the course of the experiment. Furthermore, strong antibody responses to PEDV were verified in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows with the prime-boost treatment and their offspring. Altogether, our data demonstrated that the attenuated S DEL5/ORF3 strain guarantees the safety to host animals with no reversion to virulence and is suitable as an effective primary live vaccine providing durable maternal lactogenic immunity for passive piglet protection.
fd7f3bda446027639a5b9f37fe72751c69414746	Frequent natural disasters and man-made catastrophes have threatened the safety of citizens and have attracted much more attention. The rescue mission under disaster environment is very complicated and dangerous for a rescue team. Search and rescue (SAR) robots can not only improve the efficiency of rescue operations but also reduce the casualty of rescuers. Robots can help rescue teams and even replace rescuers to perform dangerous missions. Search and rescue robots will play a more and more important role in the rescue operations. A survey of the research status of search and rescue robots in Japan, USA, China and other countries has been provided. According to current research, experiences and the lessons learned from applications, the five key performances of a search and rescue robot are survivability, mobility, sensing, communicability and operability. Multi-technique fusion and multi-agent intelligent network are considered to be requirements for the future development of the search and rescue robot. Disaster prevention, disaster reduction and disaster rescue are the important parts of national public safety. They are also crucial for the safety of citizens and their estates. Search and rescue robotic technique is an urgent needed, strategic and core technique for national development. It will be important and strategic for national economy and safety.
b6ff75f90b3cd4c41399d2861891b6167a8bac6c	A 2-year prospective study was performed of children with prolonged coughing to investigate the frequency of different respiratory pathogens, the rate of mixed infections, and possible differences in severity of disease between single and mixed infections. Sera from 135 children (136 episodes of prolonged coughing lasting 1-6 weeks) were tested for antibodies to different viruses and bacteria. Swabs were taken for culture and PCR to detect different viral and bacterial pathogens. One or more pathogens were found in 91 (67%) patients. One infectious agent was found in 49 (36%) patients, two agents in 35 (26%) patients, and more than two agents in seven (5%) patients. The most frequent pathogens encountered were rhinovirus (n = 43; 32%), Bordetella pertussis (n = 23; 17%) and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 15; 11%). The most frequent mixed infection was B. pertussis and rhinovirus (n = 14; 10%). No significant differences in clinical symptoms were observed between patients with or without pathogens; however, patients with mixed infections were significantly older. There was a strong seasonal influence on the number of infections, but not on the number of mixed infections. In children with prolonged coughing, there was a high frequency of mixed infections regardless of the season. However, mixed infection was not associated with increased disease severity. No clinical symptoms were found that allowed discrimination between specific pathogens.
aa700e4f5680906142964185c1a154b3f6730996	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ingestion of pasteurized and subsequently frozen-thawed pooled colostrum (≥50 mg Ig/mL) with different bacterial counts and immunoglobulin concentration (IgC) on the occurrence of diarrhea and pneumonia in 306 neonatal Holstein calves in a hot environment. Calves were assigned to be fed colostrum with total bacterial counts (TBC) lower or greater than 100 000 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL, total coliform counts (TCC) greater or lower than 10 000 cfu/mL, and IgC lower or higher than 85 mg Ig/mL. Calves fed colostrum with TBC ≥100 000 cfu/mL were more likely (risk ratio 1.34, confidence interval 1.05-1.71; P < 0.05) to present pneumonia than calves receiving colostrum with lower TBC (incidence 53.2 vs. 39.8%). Calves fed colostrum with high TCC had increased chances of suffering pneumonia (51.4 vs. 42.1%; P < 0.05) than calves fed colostrum with lower TCC. Calves fed colostrum with ≥85 mg Ig/mL tended to present higher daily weight gain (505 AE 113 vs. 484 AE 126 g; P = 0.09). TBC and TCC in colostrum did not influence the incidence rate of diarrhea. It was concluded that under the conditions of the present study, heavy contamination of on-farm pasteurized frozen-thawed colostrum is seemingly unavoidable and this contamination poses a threat for pneumonia, but not for diarrhea.
0fd56ba03368732e4d1c89a290d5dacc2e705ad4	Objective: To compare the difference of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female COVID-19 patients and figure out a possible explanation for different outcome between male and female patients. Methods: A total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The plasma of these patients were collected during hospitalization and were detected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Afterwards, the difference of IgG antibody between male and female patients was analyzed. The level of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed on difference between male and female. In severe status, the average IgG antibody level in female patients tended to be higher than that of in male patients. Compared with male patients, most of the female patients generated a relatively high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in severe status. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female tended to be stronger than male patients in disease early phase. The inconsistent of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody generation in male and female patients may account for the different outcome of COVID-19 between gender.
6341c582ec98c886d4b5f76ef4ac402f066a54f1	Propagation of new human respiratory virus pathogens in established cell lines is hampered by a lack of predictability regarding cell line permissivity and by availability of suitable antibody reagents to detect infection in cell lines that do not exhibit significant cytopathic effect. Recently, molecular methods have been used to amplify and identify novel nucleic acid sequences directly from clinical samples, but these methods may be hampered by the quantity of virus present in respiratory secretions at different time points following the onset of infection. Human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, which effectively mimic the human bronchial environment, allow for cultivation of a wide variety of human respiratory viral pathogens. The goal of the experiments described here was to determine if propagation and identification of a human respiratory virus may be achieved through inoculation of HAE cultures followed by whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) and sequence analysis. To establish proof-of-principle human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was evaluated, and the first visualization of HCoV-NL63 virus by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is reported. Initial propagation of human respiratory secretions onto HAE cultures followed by TEM and WTA of culture supernatant may be a useful approach for visualization and detection of new human respiratory pathogens that have eluded identification by traditional approaches.
49528bcccaed92a1bf66fdc108109bfe2a48e9a0	Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) can cause neurological disease when inoculated intracerebrally (ic) into mice and rats. Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated ic into 2-dayold Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated ic into lo-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHVJHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATllf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2-or lo-dayold intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATllf brain virus and ATlIe brain virus. ATllf brain virus and ATlIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitiswhen reinoculated into 2-or 1 O-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, these two variants did not form syncytia and had a reduced ability to replicate in G26-24 cells. o 1999Academic press, I~C.
e8d53e5527ae6c362e16b85de85a53cc3486f72f	Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be associated with various disorders. Among these, coronavirus infection may cause life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this review, we present animal models and techniques for the study of ARDS, and discuss the roles and possible mechanisms of various chemical factors, including nitric oxide (NO). Our early work revealed that cerebral compression elicits severe hemorrhagic pulmonary edema (PE), leading to central sympathetic activation that results in systemic vasoconstriction. The consequence of systemic vasoconstriction is volume and pressure loading in the pulmonary circulation. Vasodilators, but not oxidant radical scavengers, are effective in the prevention of centrogenic PE. In isolated perfused lung, exogenous and endogenous NO enhances lung injury following air embolism and ischemia/reperfusion. In contrast, NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors reverse such lung injury. Although NO is important in maintaining vasodilator tone, hypoxiainduced pulmonary vasoconstriction is accompanied by an increase instead of a decrease in NO release. In animal and isolated lung studies, endotoxin produces acute lung injury that is associated with increases in cytokines and inducible NOS mRNA expression, suggesting that NO is toxic to the lung in endotoxin shock. Recently, we reported several rare cases that indicate that ARDS in patients with Japanese B encephalitis, lymphangitis with breast cancer and fat embolism is caused by different mechanisms. Our early and recent studies on ARDS and PE may provide information for clinical practice and the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.
bdeacc039ad94473a0239c402ed7e9360885b259	Purpose: This brief report aims to provide the first large-scale analysis of public discourse regarding family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. Method: We analyzed 301,606 Tweets related to family violence and COVID-19 from April 12 to July 16, 2020, for this study. We used the machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and identified salient themes, topics, and representative Twitter examples. Results: We extracted nine themes on family violence and COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the Impact of COVID-19 on family violence (e.g., rising rates, hotline calls increased, murder & homicide); (2) the types (e.g., child abuse, domestic violence, sexual violence) and (3) forms of family violence (e.g., physical aggression, coercive control); (4) risk factors of family violence (e.g., alcohol abuse, financial constraints, gun, quarantine); (5) victims of family violence (e.g., LGBTQ, women, and women of color, children); (6) social services of family violence (e.g., hotlines, social workers, confidential services, shelters, funding); (7) law enforcement response (e.g., 911 calls, police arrest, protective orders, abuse reports); (8) Social movement/ awareness (e.g., support victims, raise awareness); and (9) domestic violence-related news (e.g., Tara Reade, Melissa Derosa). Conclusions: The COVID-19 has an impact on family violence. This report overcomes the limitation of existing scholarship that lacks data for consequences of COVID-19 on family violence. We contribute to the understanding of family violence during the pandemic by providing surveillance in Tweets, which is essential to identify potentially effective policy programs in offering targeted support for victims and survivors and preparing for the next wave.
d8eb14ca18661130fdaf099482d6cd5b46032efe	Background: Fibrinogen alpha C chain 5.9 kDa fragment (FIC5.9) is a new serum biomarker for chronic hepatitis that was discovered by proteomics analysis. Previous studies have shown that FIC5.9 is derived from the C-terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain and the serum levels of FIC5.9 decrease in chronic hepatitis. It also have been reported that FIC5.9 cannot be detected in the blood stream of the systemic circulation and it is released from fibrinogen during blood clotting in collecting tube. However, the mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is unclear. We formulated a hypothesis that FIC5.9 is released by enzymes that are activated by post-blood collection and may be coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen in healthy blood. Our analysis showed that thrombin acts as an initiator for FIC5.9 releasing, and that mainly plasmin cleaves N-terminal end of FIC5.9 and neutrophil elastase cleave C-terminal end of FIC5.9.

2765e893c0fe54ab6820f2f4abba35cea1dfc07c	Background. Nations are imposing unprecedented measures at large-scale to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies indicate that measures such as lockdowns may have slowed down the growth of COVID-19. However, in addition to substantial economic and social costs, these measures also limit the exposure to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicate the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. In this observational study, we empirically outline the independent protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI), whilst also examining whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role. Methods. We apply a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 162 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6049). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable and isolate the mitigating influence of lockdown severity on the association between UVI and growth-rates of COVID-19 deaths from time-constant countryspecific and time-varying country-specific potentially confounding factors. Findings. After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a unit increase in UVI and lockdown severity are independently associated with 17% [-1.8 percentage points] and 77% [-7.9 percentage points] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate, indicating their respective protective roles. However, the widely utilized and least severe lockdown (recommendation to not leave the house) already fully mitigates the protective role of UVI by 95% [1.8 percentage points] indicating its downside. Interpretation. We find that lockdown severity and UVI are independently associated with a slowdown in the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths. However, we find consistent evidence that increase in lockdown severity is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI in reducing COVID-19 deaths.

Further, the nation needs to fully establish and activate the national emergency operation framework.
6aaf920479e8c440f99cd8a14a3e9ebd9250d15f	The monomer of influenza haemagglutinin is synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor that during maturation is cleaved by proteases into two active subunits. Other studies have demonstrated that the human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) can cleave the HA of human seasonal influenza viruses. Consequently, we have investigated the use of human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 to produce high titre influenza haemmagglutinin (HA) lentiviral pseudotypes from Group 2 influenza viruses. Such pseudotypes represent powerful and safe tools to study viral entry and immune responses. Influenza pseudotype particles are obtained by co-transfecting human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells using plasmids coding for the influenza HA, HIV gag-pol and a lentiviral vector incorporating firefly luciferase. However, in order to produce Group 2 pseudotypes, it was necessary to co-transfect a plasmid expressing the TMPRSS2 endoprotease, to achieve the necessary HA cleavage for infective particle generation. These lentiviral pseudotypes were shown to transduce HEK293T/17 cells with high efficiency. This demonstrates that TMPRSS2 is necessary for the functional activation, in vitro, of both the HA of human seasonal influenza and other Group 2 HA influenza strains. Additionally, we show that the Group 2 influenza pseudotype particles can be used as surrogate antigens in neutralization assays and are efficiently neutralized by corresponding influenza virus reference sera. These data demonstrate that the viral pseudotype system is a powerful method for serological surveillance of a wide range of influenza viruses.

When imbibed, liquorice acts like hyperaldosteronism which presents with typical symptoms including high blood pressure, low blood potassium, and muscle pain and weakness. This article appraises physiological and pharmacological effects on health of liquorice, critiques products containing liquorice, describes a typical case report of liquorice-induced hypertension, and appraises oral effects from consumption of liquorice products.
3209c1ef66fae7f4fd86055983b4dba42c44c976	The early and reliable detection of COVID-19 infected patients is essential to prevent and limit its outbreak. The PCR tests for COVID-19 detection are not available in many countries and also there are genuine concerns about their reliability and performance. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper proposes a deep uncertainty-aware transfer learning framework for COVID-19 detection using medical images. Four popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2 are first applied to extract deep features from chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. Extracted features are then processed by different machine learning and statistical modelling techniques to identify COVID-19 cases. We also calculate and report the epistemic uncertainty of classification results to identify regions where the trained models are not confident about their decisions (out of distribution problem). Comprehensive simulation results for X-ray and CT image datasets indicate that linear support vector machine and neural network models achieve the best results as measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. Also it is found that predictive uncertainty estimates are much higher for CT images compared to X-ray images.
581f943755d091349cb6acce8a2ba50872432e82	The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak, which started in the year 2015, is considered the fastest and most widely spread outbreak reported for this flavivirus. The polymerase domain of the NS5 protein has been targeted in other viral infections and is recognized as a suitable target in ZIKV infection. Different novel modified compounds against ZIKV NS5 have been tested in silico. A few structures have been solved for ZIKV polymerase and deposited in the protein data bank website. Two of these solved structures (with a resolution of less than 1.9 A) are used in this study to test the binding of 74 novel compounds in silico. Molecular docking is used to quantify the binding affinities of ZIKV polymerase and compare it to the hepatitis C virus NS5B. A total of 19 novel compounds revealed results that are either similar to or better than the physiological molecule, guanosine triphosphate. Water molecules are found to facilitate the binding of the compounds to ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) structures. The presented 19 novel compounds represent good binders to ZIKV RdRp and could be suitable candidates for developing a new and effective anti-ZIKV polymerase nucleotide inhibitor.

b670d2abb62ed3eb4d75e7cd7582b03a898a5f12	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were classified into four clinical stages (uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia) depending on disease severity. We aim to investigate the corresponding clinical, radiological and laboratory characteristics between different clinical stages. A retrospective, single-centre study of 101 confirmed patients with COVIDwas enrolled; follow-up endpoint was on 8 February 2020. Clinical data were collected and compared during the course of illness. The median age of the 101 patients was 51.0 years and 33.6% were medical staff. Fever (68%), cough (50%) and fatigue (23%) are the most common symptoms. About 26% patients underwent the mechanical ventilation and 98% patients were treated with antibiotics. Thirty-seven per cent patients were cured and 11 died. On admission, the number of patients with uncomplicated illness, mild, severe and critical pneumonia were 2 [2%], 86 [85%], 11 [11%] and 2 [2%]. Forty-four of the 86 mild pneumonia progressed to severe illness within 4 days, with nine patients worsened due to critical pneumonia within 4 days. Two of the 11 severe patients improved to mild condition while three others deteriorated. Significant differences were observed among groups of different clinical stages in numbers of influenced pulmonary segments (6 vs. 12 vs. 17, P < 0.001). A significantly upward trend was witnessed in ground-glass opacities overlapped with striped shadows (33% vs. 42% vs. 55% vs. 80%, P < 0.001), while pure ground-glass opacities gradually decreased as disease progressed (45% vs. 35% vs. 24% vs. 13%, P < 0.001) within 12 days. Lymphocytes, prealbumin and albumin showed a downtrend as disease progressed from mild to severe or critical condition, an uptrend was found in white blood cells, C-reactive protein, neutrophils and lactate dehydrogenase. The proportions of serum amyloid A > 300 mg/l in mild, severe and critical conditions were 18%, 46% and 71%, respectively.
fe87ceac1205b76d0839854ddb905d0201fbe3de	Unemployment has been routinely used as a measure of the economic cycle. In addition, regional unemployment rates are characterized by, among other factors, their relation to the national unemployment rate. In this regard, the literature on regional sensitivity to the economic cycle has analyzed how fluctuations in the national unemployment rate affect the regions. In recent years, due to the great impact of past crises, the development of new econometric techniques and the possible arrival of new crises, the debate on how sensitive regions are to the economic cycle has reopened. In Spain, this debate is necessary since unemployment rates are very high and display a great deal of heterogeneity. We analyzed regional unemployment rates in Spain between 1978 and 2018 through a recently developed dynamic spatial econometric model with common factors and found that some regions are more sensitive than others to the economic cycle. The results seem to show that in Spain, the sensitivity to the economic cycle displays a geographical pattern where the most sensitive regions are those located on the Mediterranean coast. Specifically, we find that the sensitivity to the economic cycle of unemployment is not determined by the fact that regions have high or low unemployment; it seems that geographical location plays an important role. These results can be useful for the national and regional governments when they implement countercyclical policies.
8398a58122af240a367fa4af583ff4adea08ede8	Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been shown to play a role in many inflammatory conditions. Currently anti-TNF-α drugs (e.g. etanercept) are used in humans for treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of TNF-α in the development of virus-endotoxin-induced respiratory disease. Twenty-two caesarean derived colostrum deprived pigs were used. Initially, the availability in the lungs and circulation, and possible clinical and inflammatory effects of etanercept alone were assessed in 4 pigs after intratracheal and intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 mg/per route/per pig. High anti-TNF-α activity was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, peritoneal lavage fluids and serum of all animals for at least 8 hours post inoculation (HPI). No clinical symptoms, lung lesions, lung cell infiltration or induction of IFN-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α in BAL were detected. Subsequently, the ability of etanercept to block porcine TNF-α and its effect on the above mentioned parameters and on lung virus titres were assessed in 8 pigs. They were inoculated intratracheally with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 hours later. Etanercept was administered at the time of LPS inoculation via the same routes and dose as in the initial experiment. The parameters were compared with a control group (n=8), receiving only PRCV-LPS. Half of the animals from each group were euthanized at 4 and the rest at 8 hours after LPS inoculation. TNF-α was completely neutralized in 3 of the 4 animals euthanized at 4 HPI and significantly lower than in the PRCV-LPS group at all times. No significant differences in disease severity, lung lesions, virus replication, lung cell infiltration or levels of IFN-α, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23 were observed between the two groups. Blocking of TNF-α alone was not sufficient to ameliorate disease in the PRCV-LPS model of respiratory disease, possibly due to the redundancy in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, or the involvement of other unidentified disease mediators.
2e84c01cad3e1f37940539a14a1f043fadf5b36d	In this study we combined an inventory of the major applications, geographic regions and diseases covered by participatory epidemiology (PE) activities in the field of animal health since 1980, together with an email discussion forum with PE practitioners from different regions of the world. The inventory included the search of peer-reviewed papers, master and technical reports, conference proceedings, manuals, training materials and projects. The search resulted in a low number of PE activity results until the year 2000, followed by a considerable increase (especially from 2012). Most of the identified activities were implemented in Africa and Asia, and focused on surveillance, disease survey and prioritization, and disease control. Seventy-nine PE practitioners working predominantly in Africa, Asia and Europe (29, 22 and 18 respectively) contributed to the email discussion forum. They proposed various modifications to the existing PE definition and discussed different issues related to the applicatoin of PE, its institutionalization for use in policy development, as well as the priorities for future development. The need to increase the number of PE trained people together with some methodological developments and the application of this methodology in developed countries, were some of the points highlighted during the forum. These factors stress the importance of further developing PE as a useful approach for engaging communities in addressing animal and related public health risks.

0dc8bdf618a7e5d6a7fe83232808a139e440ca85	A dataset was constructed to examine Vietnamese student's learning habits during the time schools were suspended due to the novel coronavirus -SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), in response to a call for interdisciplinary research on the potential effects of the coronavirus pandemic (Elsevier, 2020). The questionnaires were spread over a network of educational communities on Facebook from February 7 to February 28, 2020. Using the snowball sampling method, researchers delivered the survey to teachers and parents to provide formal consent before they forwarded it to their students and children. In order to measure the influence of students' socioeconomic status and occupational aspirations on their learning habits during school closures, the survey included three major groups of questions: (1) Individual demographics, including family socioeconomic status, school type, and occupational aspirations; (2) Student's learning habits, including hours of learning before and during the period of school suspension, with and without other people's support; and (3) Students' perceptions of their self-learning during the school closures. There was a total of 920 clicks on the survey link, but only 460 responses accompanied by consent forms were received. Non-credible answers (e.g., year of birth after 2009, more than 20 hours of learning per day) were eliminated. The final dataset included 420 valid observations.
0e0c2dc9e1f1b8622503931c0e67351784107288	Blood plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses by secreting high levels of IFN-α following acute bacterial and viral infections and indirectly by augmenting cell-mediated immunity. Cross-sectional studies have shown that the number of circulating pDCs in HIV patients, compared to that in uninfected individuals, is reduced.
0c58c5ce46bfa52188d231685cc1c6a440840b85	Background: Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are important causes of upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) and lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). To analyse epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the four types of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) were studied in Guangzhou, southern China. Methods: Throat swabs (n=4755) were collected and tested from children and adults with ARTI over a 26-month period, and 4447 of 4755 (93.5%) patients' clinical presentations were recorded for further analysis.
4cb664a894b92f9d4dafdd0497c475f2f6b70aa2	The detection data of IgM and IgG antibodies in 169 patients with coronavirus disease were analyzed to evaluate differences in clinical performance between the colloidal gold method and chemiluminescence method. In this study, chemiluminescence detection of IgM antibody showed a positive conversion earlier (about 1~2 days earlier), positive conversion rates higher in different stages of disease, and a trend of declining positive rate later than colloidal gold method. For IgG antibody, the chemiluminescence method showed a positive conversion earlier and the positive rate climbing more quickly than the colloidal gold method. No obvious negative-converting tendency of IgG detection was observed within 35 days after the onset of disease. Although colloidal gold method is generally less sensitive than chemiluminescence method, it shows advantages of shorter turn-around time, more simple procedure and no special equipment required. The two methodologies can be chosen according to different laboratory conditions. A reasonable understanding of the performance of reagents with different methodologies can help in clinical disease diagnosis effectively and assist in the diagnosis of the progression of COVID-19, for which the dynamic changes of antibody will provide reliable evidence.
dc0c46650c501e1ee04ee2f78c56c7049546b8fe	To study response to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) under ammonia stress, Penaeus japonicus were exposed to 5 mg l À1 ammonia-N and challenged orally with WSSV (NW). Controls consisted of an ammonia-N-exposed control group (N), a WSSV-challenged positive control group (W), and an untreated control group (control). Immune parameters measured were total haemocyte count (THC), haemocyte phagocytosis, plasma protein content and haemolymph enzymatic activities for prophenoloxidase (proPO), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). THC and plasma protein had downward trends with time in all treatment groups (NW, N, and W) in contrast to the untreated control group (control). The percentage phagocytosis, NOS activity, and ALP and proPO activity of W and NW decreased initially then increased from 6 to 78 h (except for NOS and ALP, from 6 to 54 h) before declining thereafter until the end of the experiment. Compared with untreated controls (control), there was a downward trend for all measured parameters in the treatment groups (N, NW, and W), but the degree was WNNWNN. WSSV was detected at 78 h 0044-8486/$ -see front matter D postchallenge in both W and NW. In conclusion, 5 mg l À1 ammonia-N reduced the immunocompetence of P. japonicus and may have decreased the virulence of WSSV. D
8006e0c5ae130001f8b63257a3a85e3e1ee1661c	We study global dynamics of an SIR model with vaccination, where we assume that individuals respond differently to dynamics of the epidemic. Their heterogeneous response is modeled by the Preisach hysteresis operator. We present a condition for the global stability of the infection-free equilibrium state. If this condition does not hold true, the model has a connected set of endemic equilibrium states characterized by different proportion of infected and immune individuals. In this case, we show that every trajectory converges either to an endemic equilibrium or to a periodic orbit. Under additional natural assumptions, the periodic attractor is excluded, and we guarantee the convergence of each trajectory to an endemic equilibrium state. The global stability analysis uses a family of Lyapunov functions corresponding to the family of branches of the hysteresis operator.
83e5553035f500f4bcc4aeeaa41aa74ebf578567	Viral respiratory infections are among the most common causes of disease in humans, particularly in young children, and remain a major public health problem worldwide. For many geographic regions, there is limited epidemiological information on the main causative agents of these diseases. In this article, we investigated, in a prospective study, the viral agents leading to acute respiratory disease in children younger than 15 years of age who were admitted to the pediatric emergency unit of a major teaching hospital in Erbil City, capital of the Kurdistan region, Iraq. Nasopharyngeal samples obtained from 269 hospitalized children were analyzed for viral respiratory pathogens using the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast assay, and the data were correlated with the clinical and demographic information available for these patients. One or more respiratory virus(es) were detected in 203 out of 269 (75.5%) samples. The most frequent viruses were enterovirus/rhinovirus (n = 88; 32.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 55; 20.4%), and human metapneumovirus (n = 36; 13.4%). In 42 samples (15.6%), coinfections with 2 or more respiratory viruses were detected, with enterovirus/rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus being identified as the most common agents in viral coinfections in these patients.
2d40b0d5b2f2b639faef810f7be822c6be2a8147	The COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic with community circulation in many countries, including the United States, with confirmed cases in all states. The course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information. Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. Using an event study framework for all US states, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away. However, the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements are followed by increasingly strong policy measures. Specifically, searches for "coronavirus" increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis should track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information. COVID-19 | Google Trends | information T he first confirmed case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States occurred in Washington State on January 21, 2020. Since then, the virus has spread across the country (1, 2). There are confirmed cases in every state, and the vast majority are not connected to international travel (3), indicating that the virus had been circulating for several weeks before the first positive test (4, 5). Slowing the transmission of the virus will help reduce the burden of the disease, save lives, and reduce strain on the health care system (4, 6). In the absence of a vaccine, the main strategies for reducing transmission involve sanitation and handwashing, disciplined social distancing, quarantines, and school and workplace closures (6). These nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective and powerful ways to control transmission (7), as shown by earlier epidemics (8) and the steady decline of COVID-19 cases in China (2). To be successful, NPIs require people to undertake behavioral changes that may be personally costly. This is particularly true in countries with deeply rooted norms about personal freedom and reluctance to impose mandatory policies. In settings where restrictions on the free movement of residents are less strictly enforced, it is especially critical for public officials to know whether and for how long statements from leaders motivate individuals to efficiently seek and absorb information, as officials put their communication strategies in place. Such coordinated actions are needed at the first signs of community spreading and cannot be guided through traditional polling methods, which take too long. Because the extent of the epidemic is likely to be underestimated at this stage, it is crucial to know how much the early case announcements induce heightened collective attention and information-seeking behavior. To provide rapid evidence to inform policy making, we use internet search data in an event study design to examine how collective attention and information-seeking behaviors respond to state government announcements of first COVID-19 cases. We highlight changes in search patterns occurring in the days leading up to and following first case announcements in a state (1, 2). Fig. 1 depicts the event study estimates of the effects of initial announcements on overall coronavirus search. Searches for "coronavirus" increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the announcement but quickly decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two (Fig. 1) . There was no observable trend in the search behavior in the days leading up to the announcements, suggesting the first "local" case indeed heightened the collective attention to the pandemic. However, the increased level of information seeking faded within 2 wk, even though many announcements of school closures or other mitigation strategies followed, suggesting that increased attention is only short-lived. This is consistent with no observable trend in the sense of urgency prior to the local announcement. Fig. 2 shows the event studies of internet search for 1) symptoms and treatments, 2) hand sanitizer and diagnostic tests, 3) coordinated responses, and 4) narratives that undermine public responses. News of the first COVID-19 case in a state leads to a 52% increase in searches for "coronavirus symptoms" but does not increase searches for coronavirus treatment options. The second row shows searches for "hand sanitizer" increasing 35% immediately after first case announcements, and, unlike in the previous two cases, the search activity remains high for the remainder of the observable period. However, the announcements do not induce searches for nearby coronavirus testing opportunities, at least in the period under study. The third row suggests that first case announcements do not induce search for community-level policies Results
6b72cf69eb0577766ee2a34c2e2417fa9d857dcb	Development of effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is still a priority in prevention of re-emergence of SARS. Our previous studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein elicits highly potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized animals. But it is unknown whether RBD can also induce protective immunity in an animal model, a key aspect for vaccine development. In this study, BALB/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10 g of RBD-Fc (RBD fused with human IgG1 Fc) and boosted twice at 3-week intervals and one more time at 12th month. Humoral immune responses of vaccinated mice were investigated for up to 12 months at a 1-month interval and the neutralizing titers of produced antibodies were reported at months 0, 3, 6 and 12 post-vaccination. Mice were challenged with the homologous strain of SARS-CoV 5 days after the last boost, and sacrificed 5 days after the challenge. Mouse lung tissues were collected for detection of viral load, virus replication and histopathological effects. Our results showed that RBD-Fc vaccination induced high titer of S-specific antibodies with long-term and potent SARS-CoV neutralizing activity. Four of five vaccinated mice were protected from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge because no significant virus replication, and no obvious histopathological changes were found in the lung tissues of the vaccinated mice challenged with SARS-CoV. Only one vaccinated mouse had mild alveolar damage in the lung tissues. In contrast, high copies of SARS-CoV RNA and virus replication were detected, and pathological changes were observed in the lung tissues of the control mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RBD, which can induce protective antibodies to SARS-CoV, may be further developed as a safe and effective SARS subunit vaccine.
82a2c9757676e33f030ac98ffe2083ec37dbf7fe	Straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum), which have been identified as natural hosts for several zoonotic pathogens, such as lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, and ebolavirus, are associated with human settlements in Nigeria where they are commonly consumed as a delicacy. However, information on the viruses harbored by these bats is scarce. In this study, coronavirus sequences were detected using a nested RT-PCR targeting 440 bp of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in six of 79 fecal samples collected from an urban colony of E. helvum in Ibadan, Nigeria. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six sequences were monophyletic and clustered in lineage D of Betacoronavirus. The extension of two fragments allowed us to classify our sequences within the RdRp Group Unit defined for Kenyan Betacoronavirus from the same host species. These findings are consistent with the previous suggestion on the existence of a single epidemiological unit of E. helvum across sub-Saharan Africa. This theory, which is supported by the genetic structure of continental E. helvum, could facilitate viral mixing between different colonies across the continent.
333f835edce4857e7b15f79bbc25ef1f098aa849	KEYWORDS Bovine Mucosal Immunology Gastrointestinal Respiratory Reproductive Microbiome The largest organ of the immune system is the mucosa making the management of it essential for productivity and health. The mucosal barrier consists of mucous, antimicrobial peptides, and IgA and is a "kill zone" to prevent microbial invasion of the epithelium. The mucosal epithelial cells are key cells that maintain the "kill zone" and "mucosal firewall" and respond to metabolites and microbial components from the lumen and signals from immune cells to maintain tight junctions and prevent leaky gut. The mucosal immune system has a unique circulatory system where immune cells that have activated in mucosal region recirculate to mucosal regions, a system termed the common mucosal system.
5f36e6c3da64e8d95c81d9c63ad4909144f9191c	Occurrence of different viruses in acute respiratory tract infections of Nigerian children was examined. Respiratory swabs were collected from 246 children referred to hospital clinics because of acute respiratory symptoms from February through May 2009. Validated real-time RT-PCR techniques revealed nucleic acids of at least one virus group in 189 specimens (77%). Human rhinoviruses and parainfluenza viruses were present each in one third of the children. Adenoviruses, enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and influenza C virus were also relatively common. Possibly due to their seasonal occurrence, influenza A and B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus were detected rarely. We conclude that all major groups of respiratory tract viruses are causing illness in Nigerian children.
6c5f9f42d91f3b4534ae8357c12a625584e360aa	Gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are rare and have primarily been limited to diarrhea or vomiting. Intussusception is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in infants, with up to 30% of pediatric intussusception cases having a preceding viral illness. We present the rare case of intussusception in a SARS-CoV-2 positive infant. This is the first documented case of survival in a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient presenting with intussusception as the primary manifestation. As our knowledge of this disease evolves, surgeons need to remain suspicious for possible gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.

6691e80554ffcc290cf34d96a115600634774d20	The current study compared the amplitude of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and latencies of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) between asymptomatic COVID-19 PCR-positive cases and normal non-infected subjects. Methods: Twenty cases who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 and had none of the known symptoms for this viral infection formed the test group for 2 full weeks. Their age ranged between 20-50 years to avoid any age-related hearing affection. Patients who had definite symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as those who had a history of hearing loss or a history of any known cause of hearing loss were excluded from the examined sample. TEOAEs amplitude was measured for all participants. The high frequency pure-tone thresholds as well as the TEOAE amplitudes were significantly worse in the test group. Conclusions: COVID-19 infection could have deleterious effects on cochlear hair cell functions despite being asymptomatic. The mechanism of these effects requires further research.
fa54802099cd09681c4eeedc4423fc7c3e1886c1	This multi-wave study examined the extent that both preference and motivation for time alone shapes ill-being during self-isolation. Individuals in the USA and the UK are self-isolating in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Different motivations may drive their self-isolation: some might see value in it (understood as the identified form of autonomous motivation), while others might feel forced into it by authorities or close others (family, friends, neighbourhoods, doctors; the external form of controlled motivation). People who typically prefer company will find themselves spending more time alone, and may experience ill-being uniformly, or as a function of their identified or external motivations for self-isolation. Self-isolation, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to distinguish two constructs coming from disparate literatures. This project examined preference and motivation (identified and external) for solitude, and tested their independent and interacting contributions to ill-being (loneliness, depression and anxiety during the time spent alone) across two weeks. Confirmatory hypotheses regarding preference and motivation were not supported by the data. A statistically significant effect of controlled motivation on change in ill-being was observed one week later, and preference predicted ill-being across two weeks. However, effect sizes for both were below our minimum threshold of interest.
0d7c95184b8a77a7fc0e35995ddc804ba4145429	Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the leading infectious cause of death and the sixth-leading cause of death overall worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae, with more than 90 serotypes, remains the most common identified cause of community-acquired acute bacterial pneumonia. Antibiotics treat LRTIs with a bacterial etiology. With the potential for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, defining the etiology of the LRTI is imperative for appropriate patient treatment. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are point-of-care tests that may differentiate bacterial versus viral etiologies of LRTIs. Major advancements are currently advancing the ability to make rapid diagnoses and identification of the bacterial etiology of LRTIs, which will continue to support antimicrobial stewardship, and is the focus of this review.
e59a011ddbbf94c65b86c37b90620b8a8c3c8ed2	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as a human disease in 2002. Detailed phylogenetic analysis and epidemiologic studies have suggested that the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) originated from animals. The spike (S) glycoprotein has been identified as a major target of protective immunity and contains у3 regions that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies in the S1 and S2 domains. We previously characterized a panel of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), but the majority of epitopes recognized by the MAbs remain unknown. Methods. In the present study, we generated neutralization escape mutants and studied the effect of these neutralization escape mutations on human and animal receptor usage as well as on in vitro and in vivo fitness. Results. Distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acids were identified that are critical to the binding of MAbs with differential neutralization profiles. We also identified possible interactions between the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Finally, we showed that escape from neutralization usually attenuates SARS-CoV infection. Conclusions. These data provide a mechanism for overcoming neutralization escape by use of broadly crossreactive cocktails of cross-neutralizing MAbs that recognize residues within the receptor-binding domain that are critical for virus replication and virulence.
2713cffd0c5fa62902fc5d866fdcc3f06738a018	The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of early 2020 poses an enormous challenge to global public health. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world, taking thousands of lives in just over 2 months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients during the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5,319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our results show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.
01b5d50e48a2148c4c3d1abdf3f3bb585b744f8d	Various phytochemicals have been reported to protect against oxidative stress. However, the mechanism underlying has not been systematically evaluated, which limited their application in disease treatment. Nuclear factor erythroid 2−related factor 2 (Nrf2), a central transcription factor in oxidative stress response related to numerous diseases, is activated after dissociating from the cytoskeleton−anchored Kelch−like ECH−associated protein 1 (Keap1). The Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction has become an important drug target. This study was designed to clarify whether antioxidantive phytochemicals inhibit the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction and activate the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway efficiently. Molecular docking and 3D−QSAR were applied to evaluate the interaction effects between 178 antioxidant phytochemicals and the Nrf2 binding site in Keap1. The Nrf2 activation effect was tested on a H 2 O 2 −induced oxidative−injured cell model. Results showed that the 178 phytochemicals could be divided into high−, medium−, and low−total−score groups depending on their binding affinity with Keap1, and the high−total−score group consisted of 24 compounds with abundant oxygen or glycosides. Meanwhile, these compounds could bind with key amino acids in the structure of the Keap1−Nrf2 interface. Compounds from high−total−score group show effective activation effects on Nrf2. In conclusion, phytochemicals showed high binding affinity with Keap1 are promising new Nrf2 activators.

Organizational capabilities can be supported by Information Systems during their design and run-time phases, which often requires the capabilities' adaptation. Currently, enterprise modeling and capability modeling facilitate the design and analysis of capabilities but improvements regarding capability change can be made. This design science research study introduces a capability change meta-model that will serve as the basis for the development of a method and a supporting tool for capability change. The meta-model is applied to a case study at a Swedish public healthcare organization. This application provides insight on possible opportunities to improve the meta-model in future iterations.

44768ab23048ce2c77dd2b669f05d3a34ad4c82d	The coronavirus 3C-like proteinase is one of the viral proteinases responsible for processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins to multiple mature products. In cells infected with avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three proteins of 100, 39, and 35 kDa, respectively, were previously identified as mature cleavage products released from the 1b region of the 1a/1b polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase. In this report, we show the identification of two more cleavage products of 68 and 58 kDa released from the same region of the polyprotein. In addition, two stable intermediate cleavage products with molecular masses of 160 and 132 kDa, respectively, were identified in IBV-infected cells. The 160-kDa protein was shown to be an intermediate cleavage product covering the 100-and 68-kDa proteins, and the 132-kDa protein to be an intermediate cleavage product covering the 58-, 39-, and 35-kDa proteins. Immunofluorescent staining of IBV-infected cells and cells expressing individual cleavage products showed that the 100-, 68-, and 58-kDa proteins were associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the 39-and 35-kDa proteins displayed diffuse distribution patterns.
1584c0b314cfb3f7736b1f18d54f0ee0246a32cb	The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease and diabetes mellitus is bidirectional. On one hand, diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. On the other hand, new onset diabetes and severe metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been observed in patients with COVID-19. In this report, we describe two patient with diabetes mellitus who presented to our hospital with DKA. We also reviewed almost all published cases of DKA that had been precipitated by COVID-19. Two patients were admitted with DKA, who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 on the basis of real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Detailed history, anthropometry, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, clinical course and management outcomes were documented. First patient (30-year-male) had undiagnosed diabetes and no other comorbidities, and COVID-19 precipitated DKA. He also had COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Second patient (60-year-male) had long duration hypertension with no prior history of diabetes and developed cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was also diagnosed with COVID-19 (RT-PCR assay) and DKA in the hospital. CVA and COVID-19 could have precipitate DKA. Both patients responded well to treatment and were discharged in a stable condition. These cases show that COVID-19 can precipitate DKA in a significant number of patients. DKA can occur in patients with pre-existing diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes. As COVID-19 and diabetes are prevalent conditions, high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose DKA timely in order to improve the prognosis of COVID-19-related diabetic ketoacidosis.
56503c049375713bf552b646d62b2cac38dee77e	The outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) previously in Middle East and recently in South Korea have raised serious concerns world-wide, reinforcing the importance of developing effective and safe vaccines against MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A number of vaccine candidates have been developed on the basis of viral vectors, recombinant proteins, DNAs, nanoparticles, and recombinant MERS-CoV, and some of them have shown efficacy in laboratory animals. However, the paucity of financial support has made it difficult to transfer effective candidates from the preclinical stage to clinical trials. Here, we summarize currently available MERS vaccine candidates and illustrate strategies for future development, with the aim of provoking government agencies and Big Pharma to invest more funds for developing efficacious and safe MERS vaccines.
51c86193aaa7ed5a6c039e171dfc58234eb2e796	Abstrucr. A number of new virus isolates from finfish have been reported in the scientific literature during the past five years. These include nine aquareoviruses, eight picornaviruses, six iridoviruses, five herpesviruses, three rhabdoviruses, three retroviruses, a paramyxovirus, and a coronavirus. Not all of these agents have been isolated in cell culture or established as etiologic agents of disease by controlled transmission studies. The burgeoning number of fish viruses is a reflection of the increased interest in fish diseases, particularly those occurring in aquaculture facilities, and the number will surely grow as fish farming intensifies on a global scale. This review chronicles the new virus isolates and lists them with other members of their virus family where appropriate.
ff970b95e33dcf76aa109a0eb6b160edf2013085	Word representation models have been successfully applied in many natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis. However, these models do not always work effectively in some social media contexts. When considering the use of Arabic in microblogs like Twitter, it is important to note that a variety of different linguistic domains are involved. This is mainly because social media users employ various dialects in their communications. While training word-level models with such informal text can lead to words being captured that have the same meanings, these models cannot capture all words that can be encountered in the real world due to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The inability to identify words is one of the main limitations of this wordlevel model. In contrast, character-level embeddings can work effectively with this problem through their ability to learn the vectors of character ngrams or parts of words. We take advantage of both character-and wordlevel models to discover more effective methods to represent Arabic affect words in tweets. We evaluate our embeddings by incorporating them into a supervised learning framework for a range of affect tasks. Our models outperform the state-of-the-art Arabic pre-trained word embeddings in these tasks. Moreover, they offer improved state-of-the-art results for the task of Arabic emotion intensity, outperforming the top-performing systems that employ a combination of deep neural networks and several other features.
d51ff28acb3ce417bafc6004191510f2ce5e2354	It is known that COVID-19 spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and as a result certain ideas about contagious of COVID19 have been spread. One of them is the widespread belief that close runners -owing to the stronger exhalation, can be more prone to be infected with COVID-19 because the collision with the suspended respiratory droplets should the runner in front be infected. However, because the low Stokes number this idea cannot be generalized without carefully thought and in fact can be put into question. Utilizing the raindrop collisional model and with the help of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) it is shown that the probability of collision with respiratory droplets is not increasing always with the approaching velocity of the runner but rather there is a maximum velocity threshold at which the efficiency of collision drops.
f9f905ef190ea4a525735bc0a44d780f27b261e8	Other writers have cataloged the many contributions to understanding and practice that disaster studies have produced over the years, many of them, and the earliest, coming from sociology. The Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware was founded in 1963 by, and is still inhabited by sociologists, but has embraced an interdisciplinary approach over time, including core and affiliated faculty from English, history, political science, civil engineering, and environmental policy). My thoughts in this essay are not confined to the DRC's corpus of work, but 'disaster studies' more broadly defined below. This said, the roots of disaster studies in sociology are deep, the classic Ur-source being an unpublished PhD study of the 1917 explosion in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This disaster continues to be a source of continuing research that provide lessons for our time. My own essay will mention some of these contributions, and they are truly something to celebrate; however, the central theme I will emphasize is what has been missed and could be added to the research agenda over the next decade or so. I employ an optical metaphor that has as much to do with philosophy of science ('vision' and Mao's famous question, 'Where do ideas come from?') as it does with optics, optometry and the detailed application of methods at micro and macro scale. The lens is a remarkable human invention. Glass shaped and polished in one way opened up the microscopic world. Treated in another, the lens gave us the telescope. I will argue that politics -the creation, use and maintenance of power to influence other people and to control space and resources -has been a largely missing raw material, like glass, from which disaster studies could shape lenses for its own tools of inquiry. Consideration of power has not been totally missing. Yet lenses fashioned from an understanding of power have not been used sufficiently in a number of critical areas of research.
4f196a2c87a747cb03adee9b609d7d5c367e749a	Novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic condition world-wide and has been declared as public health emergency of International concern by WHO in a very short span of time. The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.
0d590c07f427db14b5f7dfd89acbdb3e9a6c603c	2 Human plasma contains >40,000 different coding and non-coding RNAs that are potential biomarkers for human diseases. Here, we used thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) combined with peak calling to simultaneously profile all RNA biotypes in apheresis-prepared human plasma pooled from healthy individuals. Extending previous TGIRT-seq analysis, we found that human plasma contains largely fragmented mRNAs from >19,000 protein-coding genes, abundant full-length, mature tRNAs and other structured small non-coding RNAs, and less abundant tRNA fragments and mature and pre-miRNAs. Many of the mRNA fragments identified by peak calling correspond to annotated protein-binding sites and/or have stable predicted secondary structures that could afford protection from plasma nucleases. Peak calling also identified novel repeat RNAs, miRNA-sized RNAs, and putatively structured intron RNAs of potential biological, evolutionary, and biomarker significance, including a family of full-length excised introns RNAs, subsets of which correspond to mirtron pre-miRNAs or agotrons.
33ed39d466eb5801425fef1cd03f3b88d02c2ef2	The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with K d of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with K d < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.
79c8e154907a972d60d8c04d2398bdcbeb644144	ternational data for the COVID-19 pandemics provides a good example of the difficulties inherent the solution of inverse problems. Inverse modeling is set up in a framework of discrete inverse problems, which explicitly considers the role and the relevance of data. Together with a physical vision of the model, the present work addresses numerically the issue of parameters calibration in SIR models, it discusses the uncertainties in the data provided by international authorities, how they influence the reliability of calibrated model parameters and, ultimately, of model predictions. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof in hydrology. These models simulate the temporal evolution of some compartments of the population, which is normally subdivided among Susceptibles (i.e., those individuals who have not yet been affected by the virus and which could 10 be subject to infection), Infected (i.e., those individuals who have been infected by the virus) and Recovered (i.e., those individuals who have recovered, after having been infected). For this reason, these models are usually referred to as SIR models. They are based on phenomenological laws to describe the transfer of individuals from one class to another. These models have found wide application both in life sciences, mostly in epidemiology, and in the field of economic, political and social sciences, e.g., in the context of addressing the costs of policies designed to block epidemics and the diffusion of viruses and in the realm of optimal control to assess the political measures which guarantee the best equilibrium between reduction of 20 the epidemic spread and harmful secondary socio-economical impacts [5, 6, 7]. Several extremely interesting papers have been devoted to the mathematical properties of SIR models, often by applying the theory of dynamical systems; see [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] among many others. However, previous works on SIR models have, to the best of the authors' knowledge, seldom addressed 25 the calibration of SIR models with real data, i.e., the issue of a proper fitting of epidemiological data with model outcomes. Some examples refer to applications to dengue transmission [18], H5N1 avian influenza [19], HIV epidemic [20] and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [21]. In this paper, we address the problem of calibrating the epidemiological pa-30 rameters of a SIR model describing the evolution in time of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This is achieved by solving numerically the underlying inverse problem via the minimization of an objective function that measures the discrepancy between the simulated solutions to the discretized SIR model and the official data on COVID-19. 35 Model calibration is a common problem in geophysical and environmental modeling. The present paper follows the general framework introduced in [22] to handle discrete inverse problems for model calibration and analyses the role of 2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof data following the discussion in [23]. The continuous SIR model considered here is discretized via a forward-time finite-differences scheme which is implemented 40 in a specifically designed code, developed using the Python programming language, to provide at each discrete time n ∈ Z a vector state of the discretized SIR system, which is, in turn, matched against real data in order to calibrate the parameters of the system via a minimization problem (the inverse problem). The results presented in this paper consider the application of the model 45 to a given nation, Italy in this instance, avoiding any subdivision in provinces, regions or states. The wide number of data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (also called "coronavirus") provides an exceptional basis to test calibration of SIR models via the solution of an inverse 50 problem. It is well known that inverse problems are ill-posed, due to the lack of uniqueness and stability of these problems. Non-uniqueness will be addressed in this paper by application of different algorithms for the minimization of the misfit between reference observed quantities and model predictions. The other relevant topic for ill-posedness is the lack of stability, i.e., the lack of continuous 55 dependence of the parameters to be identified on the data, so that small errors in the data can lead to large discrepancies in the parameters one is trying to identify via the inverse problem. We do not provide a full review here on these topics, but we mention [24] for a general-purpose description, [25, 26] for a deep discussion on the instability issue in the context of the so-called inverse 60 conductivity problem and [27] for recent results about optical tomography. The main objective of this paper is to fix some concepts about SIR models and their calibration and to discuss the relevance of data for reliability of model outcomes in the context of inverse problems and their application to the specific study of the spread of COVID-19 [23]. 65 The paper is designed to advance the current knowledge about the functioning, potentialities and limitations of epidemic models. It also highlights certain similarities among geophysical, environmental and epidemic modeling, therefore providing further insights in epidemic model calibration.

f9ef6ec913540d29c34992b3e93d555b5e4c7498	Respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, are a leading cause of death in persons 65 years or older in both developed and developing countries. Because many attributes of immunity wane with advancing age, the elderly may be more susceptible to respiratory infections, even if they appear to be in good health. A decline in the ability of lymphoid tissues to mount an antigen-specific response (adaptive immunity) to specific microorganisms such as influenza virus or Streptococcus pneumoniae is thought to be an important factor in increasing susceptibility to respiratory tract infection with advancing age. However, abnormalities in innate immunity may also contribute to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and have been poorly characterized in the elderly. Although changes in immune parameters such as T cell subsets and immunoglobulin concentrations have been observed in respiratory secretions from older healthy individuals compared to younger subjects, the significance of these changes for protective immunity in the lung is unknown. The incidence of pneumonia may be lessened by measures such as optimizing treatment of comorbid conditions, optimizing nutrition, and addressing swallowing disorders. The use of vaccines directed against the influenza virus and S. pneumoniae appears to have made an impact on the degree of morbidity and mortality, and perhaps, the incidence, of community-acquired pneumonia. However, better stimulation of specific immune responses with improved vaccines and more widespread use of these vaccines for protection of elderly individuals are needed.
19a21cafd97ce2671dc07f47f85e1c2dba2b3332	Theory of evidence has been successfully used in many areas covering pattern recognition and image processing due to its effectiveness in both information fusion and reasoning under uncertainty. Such notoriety led to extension of many existing Bayesian tools such as hidden Markov models, extensively used for image segmentation. This paper falls under this category of frameworks and aims to propose a new hidden Markov field that better handles nonGaussian forms of noise, designed for multichannel image segmentation. To this end, we use a recent kernel smoothing-based noise density estimation combined with a genuine approach of mass determination from data. The proposed model is validated on sampled and real remote sensing images and the results obtained outperform those produced by conventional hidden Markov fields.
743c5db7611d4af74204901e0ed3b6317a0bb3c4	Background: Effective influenza pandemic management requires understanding of the factors influencing behavioral changes. We aim to determine the differences in knowledge, attitudes and practices in various different cohorts and explore the pertinent factors that influenced behavior in tropical Singapore. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices survey in the Singapore military from mid-August to early-October 2009, among 3054 personnel in four exposure groups -laboratory-confirmed H1N1-2009 cases, close contacts of cases, healthcare workers, and general personnel. Results: 1063 (34.8%) participants responded. The mean age was 21.4 (SE 0.2) years old. Close contacts had the highest knowledge score (71.7%, p = 0.004) while cases had the highest practice scores (58.8%, p < 0.001). There was a strong correlation between knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.27, p < 0.01) and knowledge and attitudes scores (r = 0.21, p < 0.01). The significant predictors of higher practice scores were higher knowledge scores (p < 0.001), Malay ethnicity (p < 0.001), exposure group (p < 0.05) and lower education level (p < 0.05). The significant predictors for higher attitudes scores were Malay ethnicity (p = 0.014) and higher knowledge scores (p < 0.001). The significant predictor for higher knowledge score was being a contact (p = 0.007). Knowledge is a significant influence on attitudes and practices in a pandemic, and personal experience influences practice behaviors.

308feddda1dfd44c1ebb38dcc2d06bb6b2d5dddf	This research examines whether cities are getting more equally accessible and connected via high-speed rail (HSR) in China over the period from 2010 to 2015. Existing studies mainly use network centralities to describe the spatial pattern of HSR network without measuring the spatial disparity of these centralities, and most of them rely on the infrastructure network and thus fail to incorporate HSR service quality in the centrality measures. Using HSR timetable data, we incorporate both scheduled travel time and daily frequency of each origin-destination city pair into three centrality measures and further quantify their inequalities using Theil's T index. We find that as the HSR network expands, cities appear to be more equal in terms of accessibility, but their disparities in connectivity and transitivity depend on the dimensions of comparison. In general, although the difference between economic regions or between megalopolises has reduced, small/medium-sized cities not belonging to any major city cluster are further lagged behind in HSR development. The difference between core and non-core cities in the same megalopolises has decreased despite that non-core cities are increasingly relying on core cities to access other regions. .hk (Y. Wan).

c2e668e734c12f90baca2111bd639dcd86affca2	To examine the effect of provision of information about the infection control in the specific infection disease treatment unit in a city hospital on the outpatient's intention of outpatient service use, respondents who underwent outpatient medical care at the hospital (N = 821) were asked whether or not they intended to continue the outpatient visit at the hospital if a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient was admitted to the unit. Although 56% of respondents replied that they could continue to visit the department if a SARS patient was admitted to the unit in the hospital before they read the information, the proportion of those who intended to continue outpatient care significantly increased by 15% after they read it. The logistic regression analyses revealed that respondents who had frequently visited the outpatient department (P < 0.001), those who felt relieved by reading the information about the unit (P < 0.001), and those who did not worry about nosocomial SARS infection inside the hospital (P < 0.001) were significantly more likely to reply that they would continue outpatient visits. We estimated that admission of a SARS patient to the unit would result in a 20% decrease in the cumulative total number of outpatients in the hospital during a 180-day interval after admission of a SARS patient to the unit, and the cumulative total number of outpatients increased by 7% after they read the information. This study suggests that providing outpatients with appropriate information about SARS infection control in the hospital had a statistically significant and substantial impact on the outpatients' intention to continue outpatient visits at the hospital.
cd3eeb911617dd22ee6f0d1843e19ba1d255e133	Correct identification of medicinal plant ingredients is essential for their safe use and for the regulation of herbal drug supply chain. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a recently developed approach to identify herbal medicine species. This novel molecular biology technique enables timely and accurate testing, especially in settings where infrastructures to support polymerase chain reaction facilities are lacking. Studies that used this method have altered our view on the extent and complexity of herbal medicine identification. In this review, we give an introduction into LAMP analysis, covers the basic principles and important aspects in the development of LAMP analysis method. Then we presented a critical review of the application of LAMP-based methods in detecting and identifying raw medicinal plant materials and their processed products. We also provide a practical standard operating procedure (SOP) for the utilization of the LAMP protocol in herbal authentication, and consider the prospects of LAMP technology in the future developments of herbal medicine identification and the challenges associated with its application.
091a8e9a61e19e88caeb039f0e3888d111b20439	Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China. The following findings are obtained: 1) COVID-19 patients in Henan show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences, possible causes were explored; 2) Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days; Incubation periods of 92% patients were no more than 14 days; 3) The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages and showed high correlations with the numbers of patients that recently return from Wuhan; 4) Network analysis on the aggregate outbreak phenomena of COVID-19 revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various people's Hospital are the main force in treating patients. The related investigations have potential implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.

6cba4967b37918ba01a2a112aa2a4477c3f59b0d	20 Zoonotically transmitted coronaviruses are responsible for three disease outbreaks since 21 2002, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2. Its efficient 22 transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-23 receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Despite 24 numerous reports describing ACE2 mRNA abundance and tissue distribution, there remains a 25 paucity of data evaluating ACE2 protein and its correlation with other SARS-CoV-2 26 susceptibility factors. Here, we systematically examined the human upper and lower respiratory 27 tract using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine receptor 28 expression and evaluated its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19. Our results 29 reveal that ACE2 protein is highest within the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of 30 presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung 31 parenchyma, ACE2 protein was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II 32 cells and colocalized with TMPRSS2, a cofactor for SARS-CoV2 entry. ACE2 protein was not 33 increased by pulmonary risk factors for severe COVID-19. However, ACE2 protein was 34 increased in children, a demographic with a reduced incidence of severe COVID-19. These 35 results offer new insights into ACE2 localization and function in susceptibility to COVID-19. 36 37
cbd2fc716c77c1c49c6cc7149d29f272162babbf	After the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2015, the Korean government became the payer for infection control (IC) and prevention when hospitals developed IC offices and appointed IC doctors and IC advanced practice nurses. The goal was to enhance IC for all hospitalized patients to prevent the occurrence and spread of infection among them. Measures resulted in increased demand for IC personnel, especially IC advanced practice nurses. This study addressed changes in Korea's IC policies and their impact on the IC advanced practice nursing education program.
9848f25d54da7a53d5ced4a3c8adf760ecf94c33	Numerical simulations are conducted for the model (1) and the results are discussed in the next sections. As a 83 case study, the transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of 84 the parameters are estimated based on the fitting of the model (1) to COVID-19 cases in the interval between 85 March 24 and April 23, 2020 13 . Unless otherwise stated, parameter values used in the simulation are given in 86 figure captions. In all cases, we employed numerical simulation using MATLAB ode15s solver. We also used 87 numerical continuation package XPPAUT to perform one-and two-parameter bifurcation analysis; the stable 88 and unstable steady states are tracked as a model parameter changes.
ac5854f7ef4751d0a621fafd02e4cd05b08321cb	Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has emerged as a global health concern during the last decade. In spite of a high mortality rate in pregnant women with fulminant hepatitis, no antiviral drugs or licensed vaccine is available in India. HEV-protease is a pivotal enzyme responsible for ORF1 polyprotein processing leading to cleavage of the non-structural enzymes involved in virus replication. HEV-protease region encoding 432-592 amino acids of Genotype-1 was amplified, expressed in Sf21 cells and purified in its native form. The recombinant enzyme was biochemically characterized using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and Immunofluorescence. The enzyme activity and the inhibition studies were conducted using Zymography, FTC-casein based protease assay and ORF1 polyprotein digestion. To conduct ORF1 digestion assay, the polyprotein, natural substrate of HEV-protease, was expressed in E. coli and purified. Cleavage of 186 kDa ORF1 polyprotein by the recombinant HEV-protease lead to appearance of non-structural proteins viz. Methyltransferase, Protease, Helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase which were confirmed through immunoblotting using antibodies generated against specific epitopes of the enzymes. FTC-casein substrate was used for kinetic studies to determine Km and Vmax of the enzyme and also the effect of different metal ions and other protease inhibitors. A 95% inhibition was observed with E-64 which was validated through in silico analysis. The correlation coefficient between inhibition and docking score of Inhibitors was found to have a significant value of r 2 = 0.75. The predicted 3D model showed two domain architecture structures similar to Papain like cysteine protease though they differed in arrangements of alpha helices and beta sheets. Hence, we propose that HEV-protease has characteristics of "Papain-like cysteine protease," as determined through structural homology, active site residues and class-specific inhibition. However, conclusive nature of the enzyme remains to be established.
c4d26b9feff9aac3649c930ef3a4d4fc29a0fea4	the clinical and initial chest CT imaging data of eight preschool children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals were retrospectively collected. The chest CT imaging characteristics, including the distribution, shape, and density of lesions, and the pleural effusion, pleural changes, and enlarged lymph nodes were evaluated. Results: Two cases (25%) were classified as mild type, and they showed no obvious abnormal CT findings or minimal pleural thickening on the right side. Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type. Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes. One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins. The chest CT findings of COVID-19 in preschool children are atypical and various. Accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and CT imaging data.
15753984412d073dd4c6daed84e3d294f728b636	Coxsackieviruses are enteric viruses that frequently infect humans. To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques >100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wildtype CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with N63Y mutant CVB3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB3, likely because N63Y mutant CVB3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver. Our data reinforce the idea that culture-adapted laboratory virus strains can have reduced fitness in vivo. N63Y mutant CVB3 may be useful as a platform to understand viral adaptation and pathogenesis in animal studies. IMPORTANCE Coxsackieviruses frequently infect humans, and although many infections are mild or asymptomatic, there can be severe outcomes, including heart inflammation. Most studies with coxsackieviruses and other viruses use laboratory-adapted viral strains because of their efficient replication in cell culture. We used a cell culture-adapted strain of CVB3, Nancy, to examine viral replication and pathogenesis in orally inoculated mice. We found that mice shed viruses distinct from input viruses because they formed extremely large plaques in cell culture. We identified a single mutation, VP3 N63Y, that was sufficient for large-plaque formation. N63Y mutant viruses have reduced glycan binding and replication in cell culture; however, they have enhanced replication and virulence in mice. We are now using N63Y mutant CVB3 as an improved system for viral pathogenesis studies. Citation Wang Y, Pfeiffer JK. 2016.

0c6dfd6796df35e619aa7b8099bd54174415fb52	Like chemical drugs, research and development of herbal medicine also have a need to resolve enantiomers. To help illustrating the antiviral bioactivity of Isatidis Radix, a widely used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) was used for analytical and preparative separation of (R,S)-goitrin, which was reported as the active ingredient of the herbal. Improved resolution was achieved on Chiralpak IC column, using acetonitrile as the organic modifier, representing a tenfold increase in speed, compared to the previous normal phase HPLC (NPLC) method. The newly developed chromatographic method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ). Scale-up purification of (R)goitrin and (S)-goitrin was performed on a preparative column with >90% total recovery. The absolute stereochemical assignment of the purified isomers was determined through optical rotation study. This attempt explored SFC's application in chiral research of traditional Chinese medicine.
240267e88f730f0530a3e04b45dcc11bca55b84b	The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of Coronavirus disease 2019 , has been associated with worse outcomes in several patient populations, including the elderly and those with chronic comorbidities. Data from previous pandemics and seasonal influenza suggest that pregnant women may be at increased risk for infection-associated morbidity and mortality. Physiological changes in normal pregnancy and metabolic and vascular changes of high-risk pregnancies may affect pathogenesis or exacerbate the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is upregulated in normal pregnancy. Upregulation of ACE2 mediates conversion of Angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) to Angiotensin 1-7 (vasodilator) and contributes to relatively low blood pressures, despite upregulation of other components of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. As a result of higher ACE2 expression, pregnant women may be at an elevated risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 causes its downregulation, thus lowering Angiotensin 1-7 levels, which can mimic/worsen vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pro-coagulopathic effects that occur in preeclampsia. Indeed, early reports suggest that, among other adverse outcomes, preeclampsia may be more common in pregnant women with COVID-19. Medical therapy, during both pregnancy and breast feeding, relies on medications with proven safety, but safety data are often missing for medications in the early stages of clinical trials. We summarize guidelines for medical/obstetric care and outline future directions for optimization of treatment and preventive strategies for pregnant patients with COVID-19 with the understanding that relevant data are limited and rapidly changing.
53430dac5e3f325a8f4a8a20cabf1c33e55dc4c7	Aim To characterise symptoms, key findings and clinical outcomes in older adults with COVID-19. Findings 12% of older individuals did not present with classical COVID-19 symptoms, though fever, dyspnoea, delirium and raised inflammation were associated with higher mortality. Compared with fitter older individuals, some measures of immune activity were lower in frailer patients. Message COVID-19 may present without cardinal symptoms as well as implicate a possible role for age-related changes in immunity in mediating the relationship between frailty and mortality. Purpose To describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in older adults, and relate these to outcomes. Methods A cohort study of 217 individuals (median age 80, IQR 74-85 years; 62% men) hospitalised with COVID-19, followed up for all-cause mortality, was conducted. Secondary outcomes included cognitive and physical function at discharge. C-reactive protein and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were used as measures of immune activity. Results Cardinal COVID-19 symptoms (fever, dyspnoea, cough) were common but not universal. Inflammation on hospitalisation was lower in frail older adults. Fever, dyspnoea, delirium and inflammation were associated with mortality. Delirium at presentation was an independent risk factor for cognitive decline at discharge. Conclusions COVID-19 may present without cardinal symptoms as well as implicate a possible role for age-related changes in immunity in mediating the relationship between frailty and mortality.

cf5d73caa681d5149910917a4ce993d704e373b2	Colonization comprises the physical arrival of a species in a new area, but also its successful establishment within the local community. Oceanic islands, like the Hawaiian and the Galapagos archipelagos, represent excellent systems to study the mechanisms of colonization because of their historical isolation. In this chapter, we first review some of the major mechanisms by which parasites and vectors could arrive to an oceanic island, both naturally or due to human activities, and the factors that may influence their successful establishment in the insular host community. We then explore examples of natural and anthropogenic colonization of the Galapagos Islands by parasites and vectors, focusing on one or more case studies that best represent the diversity of colonization mechanisms that has shaped parasite distribution in the archipelago. Finally, we discuss future directions for research on parasite and vector colonization in Galapagos Islands.
cdfb24834093da897673e1b8fb6aa529a782bcbe	Using a multidisciplinary approach, this report analyzes the current transformation of the worldorder architecture. It is noted that the speed and depth of this transformation is unprecedented for peacetime over the past 200 years. One of the most important indicators of turbulence is a certain deglobalization of the world economy. A study of the technological, social, economic, and political variables of social change has revealed that the traditional (for developed countries) social contract between government, business, and civil society has come to a crisis. This social contract has been in effect for more than half a century, since the times before globalization, the times of an industrial and bipolar world. Its inconsistency with modern realities, coupled with the inability of the old political center to offer convincing approaches to its modernization, has polarized societies and weakened social cohesion in the developed part of the world. As a result, populist and isolationist political forces have come to power. It is these forces that have started the dismantling of the existing system of global governance and its norms and institutions. The main contradiction of the current transformation in the world order is an attempt to bring back the polycentric world to a unipolar architecture with the dominance of the United States. The most likely scenario for resolving this contradiction is to create a new bipolarity. The author of the report expresses his views on the possible outlines of Russia's foreign policy, which would enable the country to adapt to the bipolarity of the 21st century and to a new role as a balancekeeper. A new design of global architecture is proposed, which is based on multilateral responsible leadership.
c75d2d950ae6e19e4145358006e86b8b6201887f	Improvement in survival rates of low birth-weight infants particularly in the neonatal intensive care units of India appears to be accompanied by frequent recognition of Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among early survivors. As the philosophy and practice of advanced care for tiny infants becomes more acceptable and affordable in the country, a steady increase in survival of such infants is predictable. However there is growing concern in India that NEC could become a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in the future. NEC is currently regarded as the most common acquired gastrointestinal emergency in the newborn period, and the outcome of this disease is universally poor. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of this condition is required for formulating optimal principles of prevention and management. [Indian J Pedlatr 2001; 68 (9) : 847-853]
1825177c3f0bcd0e527f195a34d8fdfe94b8e6b6	The phosphoprotein (P) of rabies virus binds the viral polymerase to the nucleoprotein (N)-RNA template for transcription and replication. By limited protease digestion we defined a monomeric C-terminal domain of P that can bind to N-RNA. The atomic structure of this domain was determined and previously described mutations that interfere with binding of P to N-RNA could now be interpreted. There appears to be two features involved in this activity situated at opposite surfaces of the molecule: a positively charged patch and a hydrophobic pocket with an exposed tryptophan side-chain. Other previously published work suggests a conformational change in P when it binds to N-RNA, which may imply the repositioning of two helices that would expose a hydrophobic groove for interaction with N. This domain of rabies virus P is structurally unrelated to the N-RNA binding domains of the phosphoproteins of Sendai and measles virus that are members of the same order of viruses, the nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses. The implications of this finding for the evolution of this virus group are discussed.
89a53122ff7818db5fe2deb9b48f00be2260df10	Does the implementation of social distancing measures have merit in controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus? In this study, we develop a mathematical model to explore the effects of social distancing on new disease infections. Mathematical analyses of our model indicate that successful eradication of the disease is strongly dependent on the chosen preventive measure. Numerical computations of the model solution demonstrate that the ability to flatten the curve becomes easier as social distancing is strictly enforced. Based on our model, we also formulate an optimal control problem and solve it using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and an efficient numerical iterative method. Our numerical results of an optimal 2019-nCoV treatment protocol that yields a minimum disease burden from this disease indicates that social distancing is vitally important.

370d59bf7f643eb4a7f419b7cf31b3b67c6e0b13	Information about the basic biological properties of human rhinovirus-C (HRV-C) viruses is lacking due to difficulties with culturing these viruses. Our objective was to develop a cell culture system to grow HRV-C. Epithelial cells from human sinuses (HSEC) were differentiated at air-liquid interface (ALI). Differentiated cultures supported 1-2 logs growth of HRV-C15 as detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Two distinguishing features of HRVs are acid lability and optimal growth at 33-34 1C. We used this system to show that HRV-C15 is neutralized by low pH (4.5). In contrast to most HRV types, replication of HRV-C15 and HRV-C41 was similar at 34 and 37 1C. The HSEC ALI provides a useful tool for quantitative studies of HRV-C replication. The ability of HRV-C to grow equally well at 34 1C and 37 1C may contribute to the propensity for HRV-C to cause lower airway illnesses in infants and children with asthma.

dc9cd304f9993859f52a322aaf4984b97033cfc7	Background. The role of human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in chronic respiratory disease pathogenesis is recognized. However, no studies have performed molecular sequencing of HAdVs from the lower airways of children with chronic endobronchial suppuration. We thus examined the major HAdV genotypes/species, and relationships to bacterial coinfection, in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and mild bronchiectasis (BE). Methods. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of 245 children with PBB or mild (cylindrical) BE were included in this prospective cohort study. HAdVs were genotyped (when possible) in those whose BAL had HAdV detected (HAdV + ). Presence of bacterial infection (defined as ≥10 4 colony-forming units/mL) was compared between BAL HAdV + and HAdV negative (HAdV − ) groups. Immune function tests were performed including blood lymphocyte subsets in a random subgroup. Results. Species C HAdVs were identified in 23 of 24 (96%) HAdV + children; 13 (57%) were HAdV-1 and 10 (43%) were HAdV-2. An HAdV + BAL was significantly associated with bacterial coinfection with Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae (odds ratio [OR], 3.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-7.75; P = .007) and negatively associated with Staphylococcus aureus infection (P = .03). Young age was related to increased rates of HAdV + . Blood CD16 and CD56 natural killer cells were significantly more likely to be elevated in those with HAdV (80%) compared with those without (56.1%) (P = .027). Conclusions. HAdV-C is the major HAdV species detected in the lower airways of children with PBB and BE. Younger age appears to be an important risk factor for HAdV + of the lower airways and influences the likelihood of bacterial coinfection.
ec19bc2eee7c2b376339367dd6e3f8bef099b3b8	Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital disorder presenting remarkable phenotypic overlap with other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, making differential diagnosis challenging and its confirmation often reached with great delay. By whole exome sequencing, we unraveled the presence of pathogenic variants affecting genes already known to be involved in DBA pathogenesis (RPL5 and RPS19) in three patients with otherwise uncertain clinical diagnosis, and provided new insights on DBA genotype-phenotype correlations. Remarkably, the RPL5 c.482del frameshift mutation has never been reported before, whereas the RPS19 c.3GN T missense mutation, although previously described in a 2-month-old DBA patient without malformations and refractory to steroid therapy, was detected here in the mosaic state in different bodily tissues for the first time in DBA patients.
2c4f7ab83c2f6bcc8fbfaeb8bc5b9f511bc5f763	Zusammenfassung. Grundlagen: Allgemeinchirurgen sind in ihrer tä glichen Praxis hä ufig mit kolorektalen Erkrankungen konfrontiert, wobei Kolon-oder Rektumkarzinome in Ö sterreich mit nahezu 5000 Neuerkrankungen pro Jahr zu den hä ufigsten bö sartigen Erkrankungen zä hlen. Aber auch die Inzidenz gutartiger Kolonerkrankungen, die einer chirurgischen Therapie bedü rfen (z. B. Kolonpolypen, Sigmadivertikulitis), ist im Steigen begriffen. Das erste Ziel in der Darmchirurgie sollte es sein Komplikationen zu vermeiden; sind sie aber eingetreten, diese adä quat zu behandeln. Methodik: Wir unterscheiden allgemeine und spezielle Komplikationen. Bei den allgemeinen Komplikationen sind besonders das Vorbeugen von Mangelernä hrung und das Stä rken der Immunkompetenz zu nennen. Das in den letzten Jahren zunehmend ä ltere Patientengut zieht neben der Gefahr thrombembolischer Komplikationen mehr kritische Herz-Kreislaufsituationen, Nieren-und Leberfunktionsstörungen nach sich, die besonders zu beachten sind. Spezielle Komplikationen sind entweder vom Operationsverfahren (laparoskopisch assistiert oder offen konventionell) oder von der Operationstechnik (Klammern, hä ndisch) abhä ngig. Auch der Umgang mit dem Gewebe an sich (z. B. trockene versus feuchte OP-Tü cher) ist wichtig. Ergebnisse: Eine Verkü rzung des postoperativen Aufenthalts verringert neben der Spitalskosten auch die Infektionshä ufigkeit. Deshalb sind minimal invasive Eingriffe und postoperative ,,Fast Track''-Ernä hrung zu fö rdern. Darü ber hinaus sollten Notfallsoperationen tunlichst vermieden werden (z. B. durch Bridging mit Stents), da Morbiditä t und Mortalitä t deutlich erhö ht sind im Vergleich zu Elektiveingriffen. Bei der Operation selbst kö nnen neue Gerä te und Techniken (z. B. Ultracision + , Ligasure + ) sowie ein eingespieltes Operationsteam Komplikationen reduzieren und die Operation beschleunigen. Schlussfolgerungen: Vermeiden ist besser als Reparieren. Bei eingetretener Komplikation ist es aber wichtig, sofort die nö tigen chirurgischen und intensiv-therapeutischen Maßnahmen zu setzen. Schlü sselwö rter: Komplikation, Kolonchirurgie, Stent, Fast Track. Summary. Background: General surgeons are frequently confronted with colorectal diseases in their daily practice, whereby colorectal cancer is the second most common malignant tumour, with almost 5000 new cases every year in Austria. The incidence of benign colon disorders requiring surgery (e.g. colon polyps, sigmoid diverticulitis) is also increasing. The first aim in colon surgery should be to avoid complications and if they occur to treat them properly. Methods: We basically distinguish between general and special complications. As general complications, prevention of malnutrition and support of the immune system should receive special attention. As the number of elderly patients increases, so does the risk not only of thrombembolic complications but also of critical cardiocirculatory situations, and renal and hepatic failure. Special complications depend either on the type of surgery (laparoscopic assisted, conventional open surgery) or the techniques employed (stapled, hand sutured). Handling of the tissue also plays a major role (e.g. dry versus wet pads). Results: Shortening of the postoperative stay decreases both hospital costs and the incidence of infections, meaning that minimally invasive surgery and postoperative ''fast track nutrition'' should be promoted. Emergency operations should be avoided (e.g. bridging through colonic stents), as morbidity and mortality are clearly increased in comparison to (semi-) elective operations. During the operation itself, new equipment and techniques (such as Ultracision + , Ligasure + ) as well as a well coordinated team help to reduce complications and duration of surgery. Conclusions: To avoid is better than to repair. If complications do occur, appropriate surgical and intensive -care measures should be taken immediately.
29677aa841b47c0c3e9ce76e2cf50be297ee3cff	The reproduction number R, the average number of people that a single individual with a contagious disease infects, is central to understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. Values greater than one correspond to increasing rates of infection, and values less than one indicate that control measures are being effective. Here, we summarise how changes in the behaviour of individuals alter the value of R. We also use matrix models that correctly recreate distributions of times that individuals spend incubating the disease and being infective to demonstrate the accuracy of a simple approximation to estimate R directly from time series of case numbers, hospital admissions or deaths. The largest uncertainty is that the generation time of the infection is not precisely known, but this challenge also affects most of the more complex methods of calculating R. We use this approximation to examine changes in R in response to the introduction of "lockdown" restrictions in England. This suggests that there was a substantial reduction in R before large scale compulsory restrictions on economic and social activity were imposed on 23 rd March 2020. From mid-April to mid-June decline of the epidemic at national and regional level has been relatively slow, despite these restrictions (R values clustered around 0.81). However, these estimates of R are consistent with the relatively high average numbers of close contacts reported by confirmed cases combined with directly measured attack rates via close interactions. This implies that a significant portion of transmission is occurring in workplaces; overcrowded housing or through close contacts that are not currently lawful, routes on which nationwide lockdown will have limited impact.
6d04e85d2c994d73c9a7e2692af91470f407ddeb	A major advantage of DNA vaccination is the ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.
d2a4da62200507d10999bc50963359e099714c77	During the COVID-19 pandemic, a health emergency scenario quickly emerged and put the Italian National Health System to the test. The Pre-hospital Emergency Care has undergone several changes to cope with this situation, several Authors and Scientific Societies have addressed the peculiar aspects of cardiological emergencies but, until now, little has been written about pre-hospital trauma care. In this letter, we discuss all the aspects and changes derived from the experience of the Maggiore Hospital Trauma Center. Regardless of how this pandemic will evolve, the new peculiarities of the trauma patient approach could be permanently changed.
d8dd5049ae24480148034f394a8bc57a7ae473c6	The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 originates in the lungs, but may extend to other organs, causing, in severe cases, multiorgan damage, including cardiac injury and acute kidney injury. In severe cases, the presence of kidney injury is associated with increased risk of death, highlighting the relevance of this organ as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated tissue injury is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather is a result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation that affect lung parenchymal cells, diminishing oxygen uptake but also endothelial cells, resulting in endotheliitis and thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation. The complement system represents the first response of the host immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is growing evidence that unrestrained activation of complement induced by the virus in the lungs and other organs plays a major role in acute and chronic inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombus formation and intravascular coagulation, and ultimately contributes to multiple organ failure and death. In this review we will discuss the relative role of the different complement activation products in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated tissue inflammation and thrombosis and propose the hypothesis that blockade of the terminal complement pathway may represent a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of lung and multi-organ damage.
01a74ed9ddc26bf007e0c827ed808778fe800330	We build a parsimonious Crump-Mode-Jagers continuous time branching process of COVID-19 propagation based on a negative binomial process subordinated by a gamma subordinator. By focusing on the stochastic nature of the process in small populations, our model provides decision making insight into mitigation strategies as an outbreak begins. Our model accommodates contact tracing and isolation, allowing for comparisons between different types of intervention. We emphasize a physical interpretation of the disease propagation throughout which affords analytical results for comparison to simulations. Our model provides a basis for decision makers to understand the likely trade-offs and consequences between alternative outbreak mitigation strategies particularly in office environments and confined work-spaces.
e2a62916f92bffaeb046df4cb973fabca454fff0	Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents of various tumours such as cervical cancer. HPV binding to the cell surface of keratinocytes leads to virus endocytosis at tetraspanin enriched microdomains. Complex interactions of the capsid proteins with host proteins as well as ADAM17-dependent ERK1/2 signal transduction enable the entry platform assembly of the oncogenic HPV type 16. Here, we studied the importance of tetraspanin CD9, also known as TSPAN29, in HPV16 infection of different epithelial cells. We found that both overexpression and loss of the tetraspanin decreased infection rates in cells with low endogenous CD9 levels, while reduction of CD9 expression in keratinocytes that exhibit high-CD9 protein amounts, led to an increase of infection. Therefore, we concluded that low-CD9 supports infection. Moreover, we found that changes in CD9 amounts affect the shedding of the ADAM17 substrate transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) and the downstream phosphorylation of ERK. These effects correlate with those on infection rates suggesting that a specific CD9 optimum promotes ADAM17 activity, ERK signalling and virus infection. Together, our findings implicate that CD9 regulates HPV16 infection through the modulation of ADAM17 sheddase activity.
5d3dce397b54b88e25b7fb4901d5ace5f1856342	Overwhelming inflammatory reactions contribute to respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19. Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/ JAK2 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory properties. We report on a prospective, observational study in 34 patients with COVID-19 who received ruxolitinib on a compassionate-use protocol. Patients had severe pulmonary disease defined by pulmonary infiltrates on imaging and an oxygen saturation ≤ 93% in air and/or PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 mmHg. Median age was 80.5 years, and 85.3% had ≥ 2 comorbidities. Median exposure time to ruxolitinib was 13 days, median dose intensity was 20 mg/day. Overall survival by day 28 was 94.1%. Cumulative incidence of clinical improvement of ≥2 points in the ordinal scale was 82.4% (95% confidence interval, 71-93). Clinical improvement was not affected by low-flow versus highflow oxygen support but was less frequent in patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg. The most frequent adverse events were anemia, urinary tract infections, and thrombocytopenia. Improvement of inflammatory cytokine profile and activated lymphocyte subsets was observed at day 14. In this prospective cohort of aged and high-risk comorbidity patients with severe COVID-19, compassionate-use ruxolitinib was safe and was associated with improvement of pulmonary function and discharge home in 85.3%. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish efficacy of ruxolitinib in COVID-19.
d8196519b0be213e70c77973a63cd4a13f5532c3	Here we revisit the data of two hospital outbreaks of LF that occurred in Jos, Nigeria in 1970 [1] and in Zorzor, Liberia in 1972 [2] by looking at the e↵ective reproduction number to estimate the severity of the diseases. A description of the Jos outbreak is presented below, while the full networks of contacts of 23 and 11 patients for the two respective outbreaks are presented in Figures 1.A and 1 .B in the main text. For the Jos oubreak, TS is the index case, however other contacts are possible, for example case RA is a member of hospital sta↵. It is likely that this person was a source of exposure to other people working in the hospital, (e.g. the nurse MA and the cleaner AA) or spending a long time in the same ward (e.g. case FT, who was admitted to the ward for chronic renal disease). Extra hospital infections were plausible through case FT. On 30 December 1969, person TS was admitted to ward A of Evangel Hospital in Jos, Nigeria due to a severe febrile illness (subsequently diagnosed as LF). TS was on the ward approximately 2 weeks. Both her new infant and a three year old daughter stayed with her during this period. Shortly after TS's discharge and return to Bassa, her mother and the two children became ill. The daughter died at home.
e3ce7771f2b65f93decab8b03a30581aa36b4d74	Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract A series of strict lockdown measures were implemented in the areas of China worst affected by coronavirus disease 19, including Wuhan, to prevent the disease spreading. The lockdown had a substantial environmental impact, because traffic pollution and industrial emissions are important factors affecting air quality and public health in the region. After the lockdown, the average monthly air quality index (AQI) in Wuhan was 59.7, which is 33.9% lower than that before the lockdown (January 23, 2020) and 47.5% lower than that during the corresponding period (113.6) from 2015-2019. Compared with the conditions before the lockdown, fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) decreased by 36.9% and remained the main pollutant. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) showed the largest decrease of approximately 53.3%, and ozone (O 3 ) increased by 116.6%. The proportions of fixed-source emissions and transported external-source emissions in this area increased. After the lockdown, O 3 pollution was highly negatively correlated with the NO 2 concentration, and the radiation increase caused by the PM 2.5 reduction was not the main reason for the increase in O 3 . This indicates that the generation of secondary pollutants is influenced by multiple factors and is not only governed by emission reduction. Journal Pre-proof
8fbc4196156008369f06414c6500d2e165c0b0c6	The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most serious global challenges to delivering affordable and equitable treatment to children with cancer we have witnessed in the last few decades.
524f43fa0957b624bb7f94f7008dc8be322786d7	Background: Coronavirus can cross the species barrier and infect humans with a severe respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. Methods: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 humanorigin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus. Results: The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature. The predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18% coupled with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9638. Seven clusters for human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) were found. The cluster for SARS-CoV-2 was very close to that for SARS-CoV, which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II). The big gap in the distance curve suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual. Conclusions: The optimal feature (GGAP, g = 3) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore the evolutionary dynamic in a simple, fast and large-scale manner. The study may be beneficial for the surveillance of the genome mutation of coronavirus in the field.
4fd69d4d7584b454d8c68c36844a3bfccf9d3f4b	 Vitamin D serum levels above 35 ng/ml seem to correlate with the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.  The majority of the Western population is deficient in Vitamin D.  Vitamin D3 supplementation also requires additional vitamin K2 intake.  The immunoregulating function of vitamin D is promising and might decrease the global epidemic mortality. The world is desperately seeking for a sustainable solution to combat the coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Recent research from Asian scholars indicated that optimizing Vitamin D blood levels could offer a solution approach that promises a heavily reduced fatality rate as well as solving the public health problem of counteracting the general vitamin D deficiency. This paper J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 dived into the immunoregulatory effects of supplementing Vitamin D3 by elaborating a causal loop diagram. Together with D3, vitamin K2 and magnesium should be supplemented to prevent longterm health risks. Follow up clinical randomized trials are required to verify the current circumstantial evidence. rate; immunology. epigallocatechin-3-gallate is the most biologically active catechin in green tea. It reduces Th17 cells and increases regulatory T-cells (Byun et al., 2014). Recent COVID-19-related data evaluation showed indications that a 25(OH)D blood serum higher than 35 ng/mL might have an impact on the mortality rate of coronavirus patients. Even though ethical issues might arise (Muthuswamy, 2013), the paper's hypothesis requires clinical randomized trials to verify the circumstantial evidence. This publication illustrated the metabolic mechanisms behind that observed phenomenon. It is highly suggested to also consider K2 and magnesium intake to avoid unintended long-term side-effects such as arteriosclerosis and osteoporosis.
9b6c2a7935233cb713363dad12b2408fffd2f8b1	The ultrasonographic findings for four cats with intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy are described. In two cats, intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy was associated with chronic enteritis. In the remaining two cats, intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy affected the intestinal tract proximal to stenosis due to alimentary lymphoma and an intestinal foreign body, respectively. Moderate increased thickness of the affected intestinal wall, measuring 7-8 mm, was evident on abdominal ultrasonographic examination of all subjects. In addition, the ultrasonographic five-layered feature of the intestinal wall was maintained, and only the muscular layer appeared thickened. Abdominal ultrasound allowed a presumptive diagnosis of intestinal smooth muscle hypertrophy that was confirmed histologically in all cats.
89024ab8a7505cad265e0520fdc2fe6c5e486709	Objective: To analyze the impact of COVID-19 emergency on elective oncological surgical activity in Italy. Summary of Background Data: COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. Methods: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepatobilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. Results: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median À50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median À50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P ¼ 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P < 0.001). Two-third (n ¼ 34) of departments had repeated multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological huband-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%). Conclusions: This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list. The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately. The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.
7ff1d5c7e68d082ee1f2e6fdfbb6ae1ff931e0db	COVID-19 can affect the hematopoietic system. Thrombocytopenia at admission was prevalent, while late-phase or delayed-phase thrombocytopenia (occurred 14 days after symptom onset) is obscure. This retrospective single-center study screened 450 COVID-19 patients and enrolled 271 patients at the Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 25th to March 9th, 2020. COVID-19 associated delayed-phase thrombocytopenia occurred in 11.8% percent of enrolling patients. The delayed-phase thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 is prone to develop in elderly patients or patients with low lymphocyte count on admission. The delayed-phase thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher mortality rate. Delayed-phase nadir platelet counts demonstrated a significantly negative correlation with B cell percentages. We also presented bone marrow aspiration pathology of three patients with delayed-phase thrombocytopenia, showing impaired maturation of megakaryocytes. We speculated that immune mediated platelet destruction might account for the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia in a group of patients. Besides, clinicians need to pay attention to the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia especially at 3-4 weeks after symptom onset.
de956c0a7887331b1d2d461bf81cd2f008a893d0	We valuated specific cellular and humoral immune response of cases of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and correlated immune response with clinical outcome. After obtaining informed consent, we enrolled 30 EV71 cases including 7 cases with brainstem encephalitis plus pulmonary edema, 12 cases of CNS (CNS) involvement and 11 uncomplicated cases. We measured antibodies specific to EV71, lymphocyte proliferation response and EV71-stimulated cellular response of Th1/Th2 cytokines and chemokines. The 7 EV71 cases involving brainstem encephalitis plus pulmonary edema had a significantly lower phytohemagglutinin stimulation index than other cases (p ϭ 0.04). After EV71 stimulation of peripheral mononuclear cells, there was a significant increase in cellular Th1 cytokine (␥interferon) and proinflammatroy cytokines. However, cases with pulmonary edema had significantly lower cellular ␥-interferon (p ϭ 0.04), lower cellular IL-1␤ (p ϭ 0.04), lower cellular IL-6 (p ϭ 0.04), lower cellular tumor necrosis factor-␣ response (p ϭ 0.04), and lower cellular macrophage inflammatory protein-1␣ (p ϭ 0.04) response compared with other cases. Their titers of EV71 neutralizing antibodies demonstrated no difference among cases. These results suggest lower EV71-specific cellular response may be associated with immunopathogenesis of EV71-related pulmonary edema.

a8c1235bde8c7b6c2be395f062d100de29e658b1	Zika virus (ZIKV) has received widespread attention because of its effect on the developing fetus. It is becoming apparent, however, that severe neurological sequelae, such as Guillian-Barrë syndrome (GBS), myelitis, encephalitis, and seizures can occur after infection of adults. This study demonstrates that a contemporary strain of ZIKV can widely infect astrocytes and neurons in the brain and spinal cord of adult, interferon α/β receptor knockout mice (AG129 strain) and cause progressive hindlimb paralysis, as well as severe seizurelike activity during the acute phase of disease. The severity of hindlimb motor deficits correlated with increased numbers of ZIKV-infected lumbosacral spinal motor neurons and decreased numbers of spinal motor neurons. Electrophysiological compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in response to stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord were reduced when obvious motor deficits were present. ZIKV immunoreactivity was high, intense, and obvious in tissue sections of the brain and spinal cord. Infection in the brain and spinal cord was also associated with astrogliosis as well as T cell and neutrophil infiltration. CMAP and histological analysis indicated that peripheral nerve and muscle func-tions were intact. Consequently, motor deficits in these circumstances appear to be primarily due to myelitis and possibly encephalitis as opposed to a peripheral neuropathy or a GBS-like syndrome. Thus, acute ZIKV infection of adult AG129 mice may be a useful model for ZIKV-induced myelitis, encephalitis, and seizure activity.
efe13a8d42b60ef9f7387ea539a1b2eeb5f80101	The continued emergence and re-emergence of pathogens represent an ongoing, sometimes major, threat to populations. Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae) and their associated human diseases were considered to be confined to Eurasia, but the occurrence of an outbreak in 1993-94 in the southwestern United States led to a great increase in their study among virologists worldwide. Well over 40 hantaviral genotypes have been described, the large majority since 1993, and nearly half of them pathogenic for humans. Hantaviruses cause persistent infections in their reservoir hosts, and in the Americas, human disease is manifest as a cardiopulmonary compromise, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with case-fatality ratios, for the most common viral serotypes, between 30% and 40%. Habitat disturbance and larger-scale ecological disturbances, perhaps including climate change, are among the factors that may have increased the human caseload of HCPS between 1993 and the present. We consider here the features that influence the structure of host population dynamics that may lead to viral outbreaks, as well as the macromolecular determinants of hantaviruses that have been regarded as having potential contribution to pathogenicity.
4df4cc98bf7230832789bf6043d43387ccafc8c9	The 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTRs) of all coronaviruses contain RNA higher-order structures which play essential roles in viral transcription and replication. In this chapter we present our current knowledge of how those cisacting elements were defined and their functional roles in viral transcription and replication. Cellular proteins which have been shown binding to those cis-acting elements and potentially support the RNA discontinuous synthesis model are also discussed. A conserved RNA structure model for the 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs of group 2 coronaviruses is presented with the known cellular protein binding sites.
a32729e2a448e4b7a0bdf8949b16416c02684bd5	We present a comparative network theoretic analysis of the two largest global transportation networks: The worldwide air-transportation network (WAN) and the global cargoship network (GCSN). We show that both networks exhibit striking statistical similarities despite significant differences in topology and connectivity. Both networks exhibit a discontinuity in node and link betweenness distributions which implies that these networks naturally segragate in two different classes of nodes and links. We introduce a technique based on effective distances, shortest paths and shortest-path trees for strongly weighted symmetric networks and show that in a shortestpath-tree representation the most significant features of both networks can be readily seen. We show that effective shortest-path distance, unlike conventional geographic distance measures, strongly correlates with node centrality measures. Using the new technique we show that network resilience can be investigated more precisely than with contemporary techniques that are based on percolation theory. We extract a functional relationship between node characteristics and resilience to network disruption. Finally we discuss the results, their implications and conclude that dynamic processes that evolve on both networks are expected to share universal dynamic characteristics.
dca2973508d826f9a2477120b85385959d1eaf33	In a 22-year-old male with a 10-day history of fever, painful swelling in the left groin, and abdominal complaints, emergency surgery was performed because of spontaneous splenic rupture. At histology, a cellular infiltrate of intermediate-sized atypical lymphocytes was seen in the splenic white pulp, staining for Tcell markers. In addition, CD30 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase 1 (ALK) were diffusely positive, thus, representing a case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), T-cell, ALK-positive, small cell monomorphic variant. ALK-positive ALCL patients generally bear a much better prognosis than patients with T-cell lymphomas, unspecified, or ALK-negative ALCL. Therefore, besides the very unusual clinical presentation, this case highlights the importance of immunostaining for CD30 and ALK in all T-cell lymphomas. This report is the first extensive description of ALK-positive ALCL involvement of the spleen.
6dbe565e85a32fccee31cbecda4db86adeb0ea65	Background: The number of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Japan are substantially lower in comparison to the US and UK, potentially due to the under-implementation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Studies reported that more than half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, confirming the importance for conducting seroepidemiological studies. Although the seroepidemiological studies in Japan observed a reported prevalence of 0.10% in Tokyo, 0.17% in Osaka, and 0.03% in Miyagi, sampling bias was not considered. The study objective was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a random sample of households in Utsunomiya City in Tochigi Prefecture, Greater Tokyo, Japan. Association (U-CORONA) Study to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Utsunomiya City. The survey was conducted between 14 June 2020 and 5 July 2020, in between the first and second wave of the pandemic. Invitations enclosed with a questionnaire were sent to 2,290 people in 1,000 households randomly selected from Utsunomiya basic resident registry. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The level of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. Results: Among 2,290 candidates, 753 returned the questionnaire and 742 received IgG tests (32.4 % participation rate). Of the 742 participants, 86.8% were 18 years or older, 52.6% were women, 71.1% were residing within 10 km from the test clinic, and 89.2% were living with another person. The age and sex distribution, distance to clinic and police district were similar with those of non-participants, while the proportion of single-person households was higher among non-participants than participants (16.2% vs. 10.8%). We confirmed three positive cases through quantitative antibody testing. No positive cases were found among the people who live in the same household as someone with positive. All cases were afebrile. The estimated unweighted and weighted prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 0.40% (95% confidence interval: 0.08-1.18%) and 1.23% (95% confidence interval: 0.17-2.28%), respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests the importance of detecting all cases using PCR or antigen testing, not only at a hospital, but also in areas where people assemble. Further prospective studies using this cohort are needed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.
f0935e282683d105a11ceb947bc3f93fe81a6b82	In this article, we document the evolution of research trends (concepts, methods, and aims) within the field of consumer behavior, from the time of its early development to the present day, as a multidisciplinary area of research within marketing. We describe current changes in retailing and real-world consumption and offer suggestions on how to use observations of consumption phenomena to generate new and interesting consumer behavior research questions. Consumption continues to change with technological advancements and shifts in consumers' values and goals. We cannot know the exact shape of things to come, but we polled a sample of leading scholars and summarize their predictions on where the field may be headed in the next twenty years.
09ed8060e545725daecec09c751f35c27db6299c	The threat of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is increasing. Regarding the difference in the infection rate observed in each region, in addition to studies seeking the cause due to differences in the social distance (population density), there is an increasing trend toward studies seeking the cause due to differences in social capital. However, studies have not yet been conducted on whether social capital could influence the infection rate even if it controls the effect of population density. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical data for each prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only correlates with infection rates and population densities but still has a negative correlation with infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the relationship between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital mediates the correlation between population density and infection rates. This means that social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus infection, and social capital needs to be recharged.
f022d5c1012e2dc6aac1c710f9244688708b1447	Aim: We have designed a study with the objective of describing the clinical impact of other viruses different from the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis. Methods: A 3 year prospective study was conducted on infants admitted to the Paediatrics Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Spain). We studied the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses. Clinical characteristics of RSV-only infections were compared with other single agent viral infections. Results: Positive results were confirmed in 275 (86.5%) of the 318 children studied. A single virus was detected in 196 patients and 79 were dual or multiple viral infections. RSV was detected in 61.3% of total bronchiolitis. Rhinovirus (RV) was 17.4% of the identified virus, followed by human bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus and metapneumovirus (hMPV). Only RV, HBoV and hMPV were significant as single infections. RSV patients were younger than HBoV (p > 0.0001) and hMPV (p = 0.025). Seasonality was clearly different between them. Children with RSV infection needed treatment in the intensive care unit more frequently than others. Conclusions: In hospitalized infants, RSV was the most frequent agent in bronchiolitis in winter, but other viruses were present in 47% of the patients. RV, HBoV and hMPV had a significant proportion of single infections. Clinical characteristics were similar amongst them, but seasonality was clearly different.

Despite optimal treatment according to guidelines, approx. 20 % of the patients will report inadequate control of symptoms. Apart from well-established surgical and conservative approaches in therapy, new therapeutic antibodies are available that aim specifically at pathophysiological targets.

7c9b39a6ff64b53b3c4a93f274d776c6dc9b8c02	In this paper a modified mathematical model based on the SIR model used which can predict the spreading of the corona virus disease (COVID-19) and its effects on people in the days ahead. This model takes into account all the death, infected and recovered characteristics of this disease. To determine the extent of the risk posed by this novel coronavirus; the transmission rate (ܴ ሻ is utilized for a time period from the beginning of spreading virus. In particular, it includes a novel policy to capture the Ro response in the virus spreading over time. The model estimates the vulnerability of the pandemic with a prediction of new cases by estimating a time-varying ܴ to capture changes in the behavior of SIR model implies to new policy taken at different times and different locations of the world. This modified SIR model with the different values of ܴ can be applied to different country scenario using the real time data report provided by the authorities during this pandemic. The effective evaluation of ܴ can forecast the necessity of lockdown as well as reopening the economy.
18c628a5ce11f0907f01ae15f6dc9ab072618773	We discuss design aspects of the open-source Basic Polynomial Algebra Subprograms (BPAS) library. We build on standard C++11 template mechanisms to improve ease of use and accessibility. The BPAS computer algebra library looks to enable end-users to do work more easily and efficiently through optimized C code wrapped in an object-oriented and user-friendly C++ interface. Two key aspects of this interface to be discussed are the encoding of the algebraic hierarchy as a class hierarchy and a mechanism to support the combination of algebraic types as a new type. Existing libraries, if encoding the algebraic hierarchy at all, use runtime value checks to determine if two elements belong to the same ring for an incorrect false sense of type safety in an otherwise statically-typed language. On the contrary, our template metaprogramming mechanism provides true compile-time type safety and compile-time code generation. The details of this mechanism are transparent to end-users, providing a very natural interface for an end-user mathematician.
ae94601843c7f14fc95e723c9bce16232b0bfd70	The acute inflammatory lung injury is an important cause of death due to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) played an important role in the regulation of inflammation in the immune system. To investigate the role of IGF1 in IAV-mediated acute inflammatory lung injury, the expression of IGF1 and inflammatory cytokines was tested after IAV A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; abbreviated as PR8) infection in A549 cells. Then, a BALB/c mouse model of PR8 infection was established. On days 3, 5, 7, and 9 post-infection, the mice lung tissue was collected to detect the expression changes in IGF1 mRNA and protein. The mice were divided into four groups: (1) PBS (abbreviation of phosphate buffered saline); (2) PR8 + PBS; (3) PR8 + IGF1; and (4) PR8 + PPP (abbreviation of picropodophyllin, the IGF1 receptor inhibitor). The body weight and survival rate of the mice were monitored daily, and the clinical symptoms of the mice were recorded. On day 5 post-infection, the mice were sacrificed to obtain the serum and lung tissues. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in the serum was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; lung injury was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining; the viral proliferation in the lung was detected by real-time quantitative PCR; and the protein expression of the main molecules in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways was detected by Western blot. It was found that IGF1 expression is upregulated in A549 cells and BALB/c mice infected with PR8, whereas IGF1 regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by PR8 infection. Overexpression of IGF1 aggravated the IAV-mediated inflammatory response, whereas the inhibition of IGF1 receptor reduced such inflammatory response. The phosphorylation of IGF1 receptor triggered the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways to induce an inflammatory response after IAV infection. Therefore, IGF1 plays an important immune function in IAV-mediated acute inflammatory lung injury.

As our world becomes increasingly connected, emerging diseases pose a greater threat, requiring coordination at local, regional, and global levels. One Health is a multisectoral, transdisciplinary, and collaborative approach promoted to more effectively address these complex health threats. Despite strong advocacy for One Health, challenges for practical implementation remain. Here we discuss the value of the One Health approach for addressing global health challenges. We also share strategies applied to achieve successful outcomes through the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats Program PREDICT project, which serve as useful case studies for implementing One Health approaches. Lastly, we explore methods for promoting more formal One Health implementation to capitalize on the added value of shared knowledge and leveraged resources.
f7317d957a1c9e928c74a643ea8cc52eb24985d6	Episodes of acute rhinosinusitis are common among adults and are associated with a significant amount of morbidity. The symptoms of rhinosinusitis are nasal drainage, congestion, and sinus pressure. A bacterial sinus infection is more likely if these symptoms worsen after 5-7 days or do not improve after 10-14 days. The majority of bacterial episodes have been associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In the current era of increasing resistance to b-lactams and macrolides, treatment guidelines have been formulated worldwide to assist clinicians in the selection of antibacterials. According to one model, the following antibacterials are most likely to provide desired outcomes (90%-92% predicted clinical efficacy) for adults: respiratory fluoroquinolones (i.e., moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin), ceftriaxone, and highdose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g of amoxicillin/day and 250 mg of clavulanate/day). Although the role of the fluoroquinolones in the treatment of this condition is evolving, fluoroquinolones are often recommended as second-line therapy or as first-line therapy for selected patients (e.g., those who received antibacterials in the previous 4-6 weeks or adults with moderate-to-severe disease).
07abbba28dd64fdb2f811ee31e863e424229b21f	Background: AIDS, SARS, and the recent epidemics of the avian-flu have all served to remind us the debate over the limits of the moral duty to care. It is important to first consider the question of whether or not the "duty to treat" might be subject to contextual constraints. The purpose of this study was to investigate the opinions and beliefs held by both physicians and dentists regarding the occupational risks of infectious diseases, and to analyze the argument that the notion of "presumed consent" on the part of professionals may be grounds for supporting the duty to treat. For this cross-sectional survey, the study population was selected from among physicians and dentists in Ankara. All of the 373 participants were given a self-administered questionnaire. In total, 79.6% of the participants said that they either had some degree of knowledge about the risks when they chose their profession or that they learned of the risks later during their education and training. Of the participants, 5.2% said that they would not have chosen this profession if they had been informed of the risks. It was found that 57% of the participants believed that there is a standard level of risk, and 52% of the participants stated that certain diseases would exceed the level of acceptable risk unless specific protective measures were implemented. If we use the presumed consent argument to establish the duty of the HCW to provide care, we are confronted with problems ranging over the difficulty of choosing a profession autonomously, the constant level of uncertainty present in the medical profession, the near-impossibility of being able to evaluate retrospectively whether every individual was informed, and the seemingly inescapable problem that this practice would legitimize, and perhaps even foster, discrimination against patients with certain diseases. Our findings suggest that another problem can be added to the list: one-fifth of the participants in this study either lacked adequate knowledge of the occupational risks when they chose the medical profession or were not sufficiently informed of these risks during their faculty education and training. Furthermore, in terms of the moral duty to provide care, it seems that most HCWs are more concerned about the availability of protective measures than about whether they had been informed of a particular risk beforehand. For all these reasons, the presumed consent argument is not persuasive enough, and cannot be used to justify the duty to provide care. It is therefore more useful to emphasize justifications other than presumed consent when defining the duty of HCWs to provide care, such as the social contract between society and the medical profession and the fact that HCWs have a greater ability to provide medical aid.
7531c4305658b8cf4fa576ae050d7162043fe535	Adenovirus vectored vaccines are a highly effective strategy to induce cellular immune responses which are particularly effective against intracellular pathogens. Recombinant simian adenovirus vectors were developed to circumvent the limitations imposed by the use of human adenoviruses due to widespread seroprevalence of neutralising antibodies. We have constructed a replication deficient simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx2) expressing 4 genes from the Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (AhpC, Gsd, p12 and mpa). Safety and T-cell immunogenicity results of the first clinical use of the ChAdOx2 vector are presented here. The trial was conducted using a 'three-plus-three' dose escalation study design. We demonstrate the vaccine is safe, well tolerated and immunogenic.
92cbe76cf67a384ebfb531cd7d8331d2fde3fb49	Background: Emerging and understudied pathogens often lack information that most commonly used analytical tools require, such as negative controls or baseline data; thus, new analytical strategies are needed to analyze transmission patterns and drivers of disease emergence. Zoonotic infections with Vaccinia virus (VACV) were first reported in Brazil in 1999, VACV is an emerging zoonotic Orthopoxvirus, which primarily infects dairy cattle and farmers in close contact with infected cows. Prospective studies of emerging pathogens could provide critical data that would inform public health planning and response to outbreaks. By using the location of 87-recorded outbreaks and publicly available bioclimatic data, we demonstrate one such approach. Using an ecological niche model (ENM) algorithm, we identify the environmental conditions under which VACV outbreaks have occurred, and determine additional locations in two affected countries that may be susceptible to transmission. Further, we show how suitability for the virus responds to different levels of various environmental factors and highlight the most important factors in determining its transmission. Methods: A literature review was performed and the geospatial coordinates of 87 molecularly confirmed VACV outbreaks in Brazil were identified. An ENM was generated using MaxENT software by combining principal component analysis results of 19 bioclim spatial layers, and 25 randomly selected subsets of the original list of 87 outbreaks. The final ENM predicted all areas where Brazilian outbreaks occurred, one out of five of the Colombian outbreak regions and identified new regions within Brazil that are suitable for transmission based on bioclimatic factors. Further, the most important factors in determining transmission suitability are precipitation of the wettest quarter, annual precipitation, mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean diurnal range. The analyses here provide a means by which to study patterns of an emerging infectious disease and identify regions that are potentially suitable for its transmission, in spite of the paucity of high-quality critical data. Policy and methods for the control of infectious diseases often use a reactionary model, addressing diseases only after significant impact on human health has ensued. The methodology used in the present work allows the identification of areas where disease is likely to appear, which could be used for directed intervention.
5463932a79c76379519cd5747ebe8749ff43a48a	Purpose: To evaluate the effects of early combination therapy with intravenous vitamin C and thiamine on recovery from organ failure in patients with septic shock. The ascorbic acid and thiamine effect in septic shock (ATESS) trial was a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted in four academic emergency departments, enrolling adult patients with septic shock from December 2018 through January 2020. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment group [intravenous vitamin C (50 mg/kg, maximum single dose 3 g) and thiamine (200 mg) administration every 12 h for a total of 48 h] or the placebo group (identical volume of 0.9% saline with the same protocol). The primary outcome was Δ Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (SOFA score at enrolment-SOFA score after 72 h). Eighteen secondary outcomes were predefined, including shock reversal and 28-day mortality. Results: A total of 111 patients were enrolled, of which 53 were assigned to the treatment group and 58 were assigned to the placebo group. There was no significant difference in ΔSOFA scores between the treatment group and the placebo group [3, interquartile range (IQR) − 1 to 5 vs. 3, IQR 0-4, respectively, p = 0.96]. Predefined secondary outcomes were also not significantly different between the groups. In this study, vitamin C and thiamine administration in the early phase of septic shock did not improve organ function compared with placebo, despite improvements in vitamin C and thiamine levels.
6131658bf5fb6284c00e6ad039b284a3e0f6becd	A web-based software, called MCDA Index Tool (https ://www.mcdai ndex.net/), is presented in this paper. It allows developing indices and ranking alternatives, based on multiple combinations of normalization methods and aggregation functions. Given the steadily increasing importance of accounting for multiple preferences of the decision-makers and assessing the robustness of the decision recommendations, this tool is a timely instrument that can be used primarily by non-multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) experts to dynamically shape and evaluate their indices. The MCDA Index Tool allows the user to (i) input a dataset directly from spreadsheets with alternatives and indicators performance, (ii) build multiple indices by choosing several normalization methods and aggregation functions, and (iii) visualize and compare the indices' scores and rankings to assess the robustness of the results. A novel perspective on uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of preference models offers operational solutions to assess the influence of different strategies to develop indices and visualize their results. A case study for the assessment of the energy security and sustainability implications of different global energy scenarios is used to illustrate the application of the MCDA Index Tool. Analysts have now access to an index development tool that supports constructive and dynamic evaluation of the stability of rankings driven by a single score while including multiple decision-makers' and stakeholders' preferences.
8602709a812146a012e16df450b991f6343d2f46	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has recently caused high mortality in suckling piglets with subsequent large economic losses to the swine industry. Many intracellular signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, are activated by viral infection. The PI3K/Akt pathway is an important cellular pathway that has been shown to be required for virus replication. In the present study, we found that the PEDV JS-2013 strain activated Akt in Vero cells at early (5-15 min) and late stages (8-10 h) of infection. Inhibiting PI3K, an upstream activator of Akt, enhanced PEDV replication. Inhibiting GSK-3α/β, one of the downstream effectors of PI3K/Akt pathway and regulated by Akt during PEDV infected Vero cells, also enhanced PEDV replication. Collectively, our data suggest that PI3K/Akt/GSK-3α/β signaling pathway is activated by PEDV and functions in inhibiting PEDV replication.
aa339dc08635486396623300d7ab64d1c8d632f6	The attention mechanism has demonstrated superior performance for inference over nodes in graph neural networks (GNNs), however, they result in a high computational burden during both training and inference. We propose FastGAT, a method to make attention based GNNs lightweight by using spectral sparsification to generate an optimal pruning of the input graph. This results in a per-epoch time that is almost linear in the number of graph nodes as opposed to quadratic. Further, we provide a re-formulation of a specific attention based GNN, Graph Attention Network (GAT) that interprets it as a graph convolution method using the random walk normalized graph Laplacian. Using this framework, we theoretically prove that spectral sparsification preserves the features computed by the GAT model, thereby justifying our FastGAT algorithm. We experimentally evaluate FastGAT on several large real world graph datasets for node classification tasks, FastGAT can dramatically reduce (up to 10x) the computational time and memory requirements, allowing the usage of attention based GNNs on large graphs.
10e66b2bf3f9896fd2337db3a68b974aaebc79d1	Molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 is the mainstay for accurate diagnosis of the infection, 16 but the diagnostic performances of available assays have not been defined. We compared 17 12 molecular diagnostic assays, including 8 commercial kits using 155 respiratory 18 samples (65 nasopharyngeal swabs, 45 oropharyngeal swabs, and 45 sputum) collected at 19 2 Japanese hospitals. Sixty-eight samples were positive for more than one assay and one 20 genetic locus and were defined as true positive samples. All the assays showed a 21 specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval, 95.8 to 100). The N2 assay kit of the US 22 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the N2 assay of the Japanese 23 National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) were the most sensitive assays with 100% 24 sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 94.7 to 100), followed by the CDC N1 kit, E assay 25 by Corman, and NIID N2 assay multiplex with internal control reactions . These assays 26 are reliable as first-line molecular assays in laboratories when combined with appropriate 27 internal control reactions. 28 29 30 Accurate detection tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 31 (SARS-CoV-2) are important to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 32 pandemic (1). Various molecular diagnostic assays have been developed and used 33 worldwide (1-4) , but the differences in their diagnostic performances remain poorly 34 understood. In this study, we aimed to compare the performance of 12 molecular assays.
e125efdb411edece9a23a57d3e6042918a4994e9	A cDNA probe representing the genome of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 (MHV-A59) was used to measure nucleotide sequence homologies among murine and human coronaviruses and the SD and SK coronaviruses isolated by Burks et al. Since SD and SK were isolated by inoculation of multiple sclerosis (MS) central nervous system (CNS) tissue into mice or cultured mouse cells, it is important to determine their relationships to other murine and human coronavirus isolates. Our results indicate that SD and SK share almost complete nucleotide homology (approximately 90% ) with MHV-A59 and generate subgenomic RNAs of the same sizes as MHV-A59. The human coronavirus (HCV) strains tested show less homology with MHV-A59. The immunologically unrelated HCV-229E shows no nucleotide homology with MHV-A59. The immunologically crossreactive HCV-OC43 shows nucleotide homology with MHV-A59 by blot hybridization but not when hybridized in solution and assayed by S1 nuclease digestion. 669
304d61d063b602c2971b9df3ce167445c9880645	Background: Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an economically important disease of small ruminants such as sheep and goats. The disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. A SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR targeting the N gene of PPRV has not been established for PPRV detection. Thus, the objective of present study was to develop highly sensitive N gene target SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR for specific detection and quantification of PPRV in clinical samples. A set of primers was designed to detect the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PPRV. The assay exhibited high specificity as all the viruses which have clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including Canine distemper virus (CDV), Measles virus (MV), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to show an amplification signal. The lower detection limit of the assay was 5.11 copies/μl (Ct value of 33.67 ± 0.5) and 0.001 TCID 50 /ml (Ct value of 34.7 ± 0.5) based on plasmid copy number and tissue culture infectivity titre. The assay was 3-log more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for intra-and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from 0.32% -2.31%, and 0.71% -5.32%, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the newly developed assay, a total of 36 clinical samples suspected of PPR were screened for the presence of PPRV in parallel with conventional RT-PCR. The real time RT-PCR assay detected PPRV in 30 (83.3%) of clinical samples compared to 16 (44.4%) by conventional RT-PCR. The two-step SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR assay reported here is highly sensitive, specific, reproducible and rapid for detection and quantification of PPRV nucleic acids.
a8b801f23efa409e89226176fec4c0517e330717	The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is a pelagic fish species listed as endangered under both the USA Federal and Californian State Endangered Species Acts and considered an indicator of ecosystem health in its habitat range, which is limited to the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary in California, USA. Anthropogenic contaminants are one of multiple stressors affecting this system, and among them, current-use insecticides are of major concern. Interrogative tools are required to successfully monitor effects of contaminants on the delta smelt, and to research potential causes of population decline in this species. We have created a microarray to investigate genome-wide effects of potentially causative stressors, and applied this tool to assess effects of the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate on larval delta smelt. Selected genes were further investigated as molecular biomarkers using quantitative PCR analyses. Results: Exposure to esfenvalerate affected swimming behavior of larval delta smelt at concentrations as low as 0.0625 μg.L -1 , and significant differences in expression were measured in genes involved in neuromuscular activity. Alterations in the expression of genes associated with immune responses, along with apoptosis, redox, osmotic stress, detoxification, and growth and development appear to have been invoked by esfenvalerate exposure. Swimming impairment correlated significantly with expression of aspartoacylase (ASPA), an enzyme involved in brain cell function and associated with numerous human diseases. Selected genes were investigated for their use as molecular biomarkers, and strong links were determined between measured downregulation in ASPA and observed behavioral responses in fish exposed to environmentally relevant pyrethroid concentrations. a. b. * (LC 50 = 0.19 μg.L -1 ) (EC 50 = 0.04 μg.L -1 ) (EC 50 = 0.38 μg.L -1 ) (LC 50 = 0.24 μg.L -1 ) (EC 50 = 0.11 μg.L -1 ) (EC 50 = 0.13 μg.L -1 )
18fb0cf6fba22d9478d4f5774f37f6b6bf09f3b0	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a leading disease in pig industry worldwide and can result in serious economic losses each year. The PRRS epidemic situation in China has been very complicated since the unprecedented largescale highly pathogenic PRRS (HP-PRRS) outbreaks in 2006. And now the HP-PRRS virus (HP-PRRSV) and classical North American type PRRSV strains have coexisted in China. Rapid differential detection of the two strains of PRRSV is very important for effective PRRS control. The real-time RT-PCR for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV by using both SYBR Green and TaqMan probes was developed and validated. Both assays can be used for rapid detection and strainspecific identification of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV. However, the TaqMan probe method had the highest detection rate whereas the conventional RT-PCR was the lowest. The real-time RT-PCR developed based on SYBR Green and TaqMan probe could be used for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV in China, which will benefit much the PRRS control and research.
90662d7dc7b09e018829ae2bc13e167b218931d8	Background: Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated as a result of the immune response are likely to be the most effective therapeutic antibodies, particularly in the case of infectious diseases against which the immune response is protective. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an ubiquitous opportunistic virus that is the most serious pathogenic agent in transplant patients. The available therapeutic armamentarium (e.g. HCMV hyperimmune globulins or antivirals) is associated with severe side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains; therefore, neutralizing human mAb may be a decisive alternative in the prevention of primary and re-activated HCMV infections in these patients. The purpose of this study was to generate neutralizing mAb against HCMV from the immunological repertoire of immune donors. To this aim, we designed an efficient technology relying on two discrete and sequential steps: first, human B-lymphocytes are stimulated with TLR9-agonists and IL-2; second, after both additives are removed, the cells are infected with EBV. Using this strategy we obtained 29 clones secreting IgG neutralizing the HCMV infectivity; four among these were further characterized. All of the mAbs neutralize the infection in different combinations of HCMV strains and target cells, with a potency ~20 fold higher than that of the HCMV hyperimmune globulins, currently used in transplant recipients. Recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 suitable as a prophylactic or therapeutic tool in clinical applications has been generated. The technology described has proven to be more reproducible, efficient and rapid than previously reported techniques, and can be adopted at low overall costs by any cell biology laboratory for the development of fully human mAbs for immunotherapeutic uses.

6ecb237cb31e92864c4ac6adb29febc457ee8bd7	The uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 has called for unprecedented measures, to the extent that the Italian government has imposed a quarantine on the entire country. Quarantine has a huge impact and can cause considerable psychological strain. The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population. An online survey was administered from 18-22 March 2020 to 2766 participants. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress. Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively. This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.
435b58b1b6b499274125be7c1b8d903fe6368959	Infectious diseases are a leading cause of death globally. Decisions surrounding how to control an infectious disease outbreak currently rely on a subjective process involving surveillance and expert opinion. However, there are many situations where neither may be available. Modeling can fill gaps in the decision making process by using available data to provide quantitative estimates of outbreak trajectories. Effective reduction of the spread of infectious diseases can be achieved through collaboration between the modeling community and public health policy community. However, such collaboration is rare, resulting in a lack of models that meet the needs of the public health community. Here we show a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model modified to include control measures that allows parameter ranges, rather than parameter point estimates, and includes a web user interface for broad adoption. We apply the model to three diseases, measles, norovirus and influenza, to show the feasibility of its use and describe a research agenda to further promote interactions between decision makers and the modeling community. Despite substantial public health improvements in the last century, infectious diseases remain one of the leading causes of both morbidity and mortality 1,2 . When confronted with an infectious disease outbreak, public health officials typically work to control the outbreak by performing assessments, analyzing surveillance data, identifying resources and interacting with subject mater experts 2-4 . Control measures are then implemented based on the cumulative information collected. These approaches rely heavily on good surveillance systems, access to experts, and good intuition about which control measures to use. As such, they are largely subjective, time consuming, and the infrastructure required is often not present in high disease burden areas. Modeling is an attractive supplemental method because of the ability to estimate an outbreak's trajectory and the effects of possible control measures in a timely manner. Compartmental models are historically common; they divide individuals into categories based on their disease status. The most common variant is the SIR model, named after the categories used-"susceptible", "infectious" and "recovered". Models of this nature have small computational requirements, and are thus commonly used as first pass attempts to characterize outbreaks or infections quickly 5 . For example, after the sudden emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the early 2000s, researchers used modeling to characterize the virus' epidemiology. Several used compartmental models with control measures like quarantine or isolation in various settings (e.g., hospitals or cities) to describe effects of possible interventions 6-9 . Similar work exists for essentially all well known infectious diseases. For example, Mandal et al. provide a review of models used for malaria 10 and Bauch et al. explore model use with respect to SARS and other emerging infectious diseases 6 . Methods among these groups are often similar, but tend to focus on specific diseases and locations of interest. In contrast, agent-based models use a bottom-up approach where the agents (these are often people) interact with particular rules to simulate outbreaks 11 . This allows simulations at high resolutions, but requires large amounts of data to parameterize the models, as well as substantial computational power. It is thought that they may reflect real world scenarios more accurately, but the lack of available epidemiological data necessitates assumptions that are difficult or impossible to test 11 . These models further require computational resources inaccessible to an average health department. Both agent-based and compartmental models exhibit additional features that are problematic to wide-spread model adoption. The first is the focus on particular disease-location pairs. This emphasis precludes application to
27c319778bbbfb158fd14e4f40619aafc704fd69	Treatment with psychotropic medication may sometimes be jeopardised because of the COVID-19 pandemic. One underlying reason is the lack of COVID-19-specific psychopharmacology guidelines. Here, we discuss five considerations arising from our clinical experience and pharmacological background knowledge to enable safe and well-informed psychopharmacotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
56816e072e2af57957c7c6dcbbccd714463004bb	Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease-2019 has rapidly spread across the globe. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, ageassociated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease. Age is one of the strongest risk factors for severe outcomes among patients with COVID-19 1,2 . For instance, the case-fatality rate of patients 50-59 years old was reported to be 1.0% in Italy (as of March 17, 2020) and 1.3% in China (as of February 11, 2020) 3,4 ; in contrast, the case-fatality rate of patients ≥ 80 years old was 20.2% in Italy, and 14.8% in China during that same time frame (Figure 1a) . Similarly, in the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that from February 12 to March 16, 2020, the case-fatality rate of patients 55-64 years old was 1.4 -2%, and 10.4 -27.3% for patients ≥ 85 years old 5 (Figure 1a) . Furthermore, a recent analysis of Chinese CDC data revealed that while patients of all ages shared a similar probability of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 6-8 , the clinical manifestations of infection in children (< 18 years old) were less severe than in adults. With the exception of infants and younger children (< 1 years old and 1-5 years old, respectively), most children were asymptomatic or experienced mild illness 9 . Collectively, these observations indicate a strong association between age and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. However, it must be emphasized that younger patients can still frequently contract the disease, possibly leading to hospitalization, ICU admission, or death (Supplementary Figure 1) . While the effects of age on COVID-19 are likely to be multifactorial, involving a complex blend of systemic and local factors, we hypothesized that tissue-intrinsic changes that occur with aging may offer valuable clues. To explore possible mechanisms by which age influences the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we investigate the transcriptomic features and cellular landscape of the aging human lung in relation to SARS-CoV-2. We focused our analysis on the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project 10,11 , a comprehensive public resource of gene expression profiles from non-diseased tissue sites. As the lung is the primary organ affected by COVID-19, we specifically analyzed lung RNA-seq transcriptomes from donors of varying ages (20-79 years old) (Figure 1b) . A total of 578 lung RNA-seq profiles were compiled, of which 31.66% were from women. An initial hypothesis for why SARS-CoV-2 differentially affects patients of varying ages is that the expression of host factors essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase with aging. To assess this possibility, we examined the gene expression of ACE2, which encodes the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 that is coopted as the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 8,12-15 . There was no statistically significant association between age and ACE2 expression levels (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.92) (Figure 1c) . While ACE2 is the direct cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L (CTSL) have been demonstrated to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection by priming the spike protein for host cell entry 14 . Expression of the corresponding genes TMPRSS2 and CTSL was modestly associated with age (p = 0.0039 and p = 0.026, respectively) (Figure 1c) , but TMPRSS2 and CTSL expression levels tended to decrease with age. Of note, biological sex was not significantly associated with expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, or CTSL (Supplementary Figure 2a-c) , though it has been observed that males are more likely to be affected by COVID-19 than females [16] [17] [18] . Taken together,
3bc4958efd1b8b6bfa11f8e81571f65f9fe0b0a4	Strains OC43 and 229E of human coronaviruses (HCoV) cause one-third of common colds and hospital-acquired upper respiratory tract HCoV infections have been reported in premature newborns. To evaluate possible sources of infection, virus survival was studied in aqueous suspensions and on absorptive and non-absorptive surfaces representative of a hospital environment. Virus susceptibility to chemical disinfection with standard products was also characterized. Virus survived in saline solution for as long as six days but less in culture medium, with or without added cells. After drying, HCoV-229E infectivity was still detectable after 3 h on various surfaces (aluminum, sterile latex surgical gloves, sterile sponges) but HCoV-OC43 survived 1 h or less. Of the various chemical disinfectants tested, Proviodine ® reduced the virus infectious titre by at least 50%. This study suggests that surfaces and suspensions can be considered as possible sources of contamination that may lead to hospital-acquired infections with HCoV and should be appropriately disinfected.
6929c0cdf46c3ce1e9c963487cc83c986a2870ef	Statistical methods for molecular dating of viral origins have been used extensively to infer the time of most common recent ancestor for many rapidly evolving pathogens. However, there are a number of cases, in which epidemiological, historical, or genomic evidence suggests much older viral origins than those obtained via molecular dating. We demonstrate how pervasive purifying selection can mask the ancient origins of recently sampled pathogens, in part due to the inability of nucleotide-based substitution models to properly account for complex patterns of spatial and temporal variability in selective pressures. We use codon-based substitution models to infer the length of branches in viral phylogenies; these models produce estimates that are often considerably longer than those obtained with traditional nucleotide-based substitution models. Correcting the apparent underestimation of branch lengths suggests substantially older origins for measles, Ebola, and avian influenza viruses. This work helps to reconcile some of the inconsistencies between molecular dating and other types of evidence concerning the age of viral lineages.

30215fe783662edff46565307706587b3bdd60a5	The induction of immunological memory, which is mediated by memory T and B cells, is central to adaptive protective immunity to pathogens induced by previous infection and is the cornerstone of effective vaccine design. Recent studies in mice have suggested that memory T cells that accumulate in tissues, termed tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, play a crucial role in maintaining long-term protective immunity to mucosal pathogens. CD4 and CD8 TRM cells can be induced following infection at mucosal sites or the skin, where they are maintained and poised to respond rapidly to reinfection with the same pathogen. TRM cells can also be generated by vaccination, but their induction is influenced by a number of factors, including the type of vaccine, the adjuvant, and the route of immunization. Live attenuated vaccines appear to be more effective than killed or subunit vaccines at inducing TRM cells and mucosal immunization, especially by intranasal route, is more effective than parenteral delivery. However, evidence is emerging that formulation of killed or subunit vaccines with novel adjuvants, especially those that generate Th1 and Th17 responses, can promote the induction of TRM cells. While TRM cells are also present at high number in mucosal tissues in humans, one of the challenge will be to develop methodologies for routine quantification of these cells in humans. Nevertheless, the identification of approaches for optimum induction of TRM cells in mice should assist in the design of more effective vaccines that sustain protective immunity against a range of human pathogens.
58d1bb4770e803382c8b7fed281d576614ecd61a	To determine rates of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection among ambulatory adults, we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens, demographic characteristics, and survey information from 1477 adult visitors to a New York City tourist attraction during April-July 2016. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to identify specimens positive for common respiratory viruses. A total of 7.2% of samples tested positive for respiratory viruses; among positive samples, 71.0% contained rhinovirus, and 21.5% contained coronavirus. Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus were also detected. Depending on symptomatologic definition, 57.7%-93.3% of positive samples were asymptomatic. These findings indicate that significant levels of asymptomatic respiratory viral shedding exist during summer among the ambulatory adult population.

75a8ca179e8e0405a9c150507809c0f5c38aedb5	To develop an effective vaccine that does not enhance RSV illness, it is important to understand how formalin and heat inactivation affected the antigenicity and immunogenicity of FI-RSV compared to native virus. Informed by atomic structures of RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein in prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations, we demonstrate that FI-RSV predominately presents post-F on the virion surface, whereas infectious RSV presents both pre-F and post-F conformations. This significant antigenic distinction has not been previously appreciated. Thus, a stabilized pre-F antigen is more representative of live RSV than F in its post-F conformation, as displayed on the surface of FI-RSV. This finding has major implications for discriminating current pre-F-based immunogens from FI-RSV used in historical vaccine trials. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped, non-segmented negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Nearly everyone is infected with the virus in the first two years of life; while reinfections occur throughout life, disease severity is highest in infants and the elderly. RSV represents a serious health and economic burden, and is the leading cause of hospitalization in children under the age of 5 (ref. 1). Despite RSV being discovered nearly 60 years ago, no licensed vaccine is yet available. In part, this delayed development stems from clinical trials using formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) product that caused an enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) syndrome in children who received the FI-RSV vaccine. The FI-RSV vaccine adjuvanted with alum was evaluated in four separate studies in seronegative infants and young children in 1966 (refs 2-6). Instead of eliciting protective immunity, a greater number of vaccinees developed severe illness compared to control groups. A three dose regimen (0, 1, 4 months) was used in subjects between 2 and 7 months of age, 16 were hospitalized of the 20 infected children in the FI-RSV-vaccinated group (N = 31) compared to only 1 hospitalized of 21 infected in the control groups (N = 40) 3 . Tragically, two of the FI-RSV recipients died at 14 and 16 months of age from bacterial pneumonia complicating their subsequent RSV infection. In the majority of vaccinees, priming with FI-RSV led to pathology upon subsequent RSV infection that ordinarily is only manifest in a small fraction of RSV-naïve individuals. The immunological basis for FI-RSV-induced enhanced illness has focused on two major features of the humoral and cellular responses. First, FI-RSV induced high titers of binding antibody with weak neutralizing and fusion-inhibitory activity 7,8 . These antibodies in the context of large antigen load led to immune complex deposition and complement activation in airways upon subsequent RSV infection 9 . Second, natural RSV infection after immunization with FI-RSV was associated with exaggerated peribronchiolar inflammation and infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils into airways. This is consistent with findings in animal models where FI-RSV has been shown to induce Th2-biased immune responses and airway hypersensitivity characterized by up regulation of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IgE 10 . Importantly, FI-RSV vaccination does not result in enhanced RSV disease when individuals are first primed with live virus infection or attenuated replication-competent vaccines are given intranasally or parenterally 11,12 , indicating that immunological priming with the FI-RSV vaccine was responsible for aberrant responses to subsequent infection. Therefore, to develop an effective vaccine that does not enhance RSV illness upon subsequent

However, developmental data on blow fly eggs are mainly limited to records of the time to larval hatching. The current paper describes the morphological changes occurring during embryogenesis of the blow fly Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and their timing in relation to temperature, in order to determine those characters which can be used for simple egg age estimation using light microscopy. At 7.3 and 25°C, 15 easily visualised morphological landmarks were determined in C. vicina living embryos, allowing for their age estimation with a resolution of 10-20 % of total egg developmental time. The observed age intervals were compared to the embryonic stages described for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, which are used as reference data in multiple developmental studies. Moreover, current guidelines for preservation of egg samples, which recommend the placement of living eggs directly into 80 % ethanol, were tested against the hot water killing (HWK) method prior to preservation in 80 % ethanol, recommended for larval and pupal specimens. Direct placement of eggs into 80 % ethanol caused marked decomposition of samples, and no morphological landmarks were discernible. On the other hand, HWK fixation prior to preservation in 80 % ethanol enabled visualisation of 11 of the 15 age-specific morphological landmarks that were discernible in living embryos. Therefore, HWK fixation prior to preservation in 80 % ethanol is recommended for egg samples, thus unifying the protocols for collecting entomological evidence.
7b917e86414e580ebed97a3560e8d41a38c42ce7	Évoquer une infection respiratoire basse est aisé devant des signes respiratoires (toux, expectoration mucopurulente ou purulente) associés à des signes infectieux (fièvre notamment). En revanche, différencier bronchite et pneumonie est parfois plus difficile et constitue un enjeu important en raison de la mortalité des pneumonies et d'une prise en charge spécifique. L'élément clef du diagnostic est la radiographie de thorax dont l'indication repose sur des signes en foyer (crépitants, matité), une fièvre, une polypnée supérieure à 25/min, une tachycardie supérieure à 100/min. Leur valeur diagnostique n'est pas suffisante pour affirmer ou exclure une pneumonie ce qui justifie une radiographie en cas de doute clinique. Les éléments cliniques et radiologiques ne permettent pas un diagnostic étiologique fiable. L'analyse de l'expectoration, la recherche d'antigènes urinaires de pneumocoque et de Legionella constituent des éléments d'orientation. Le pneumocoque vient en tête des germes responsables de pneumonie, suivi par les germes atypiques et la légionellose. L'existence d'une bronchopneumopathie chronique obstructive (BPCO) expose au risque de décompensation et d'insuffisance respiratoire aiguë. Les causes d'exacerbation d'une BPCO sont multiples mais son origine infectieuse, notamment virale, est de l'ordre de 50 %. Les rhinovirus sont en cause dans 40 à 50 % des cas. D'autres virus peuvent être en cause et s'associer à la présence de bactéries (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, B. catarrhalis). L'appréciation de la gravité repose sur la connaissance du volume expiratoire maximal par seconde de base que l'Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé propose de remplacer, lorsque ce paramètre n'est pas connu, par une appréciation de l'intensité de la dyspnée. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits réservés. Lower respiratory tract infection is easily suggested on clinical signs (cough and sputum) associated with fever. To discriminate between pneumonia and acute bronchitis is crucial because of the mortality associated with pneumonia and of its specific management. Chest X-ray is a key exam for the diagnosis and should be performed on the basis of validated clinical signs that are however of weak diagnostic value. Clinical as well as radiological signs cannot be reliably used to identify the causative germ. Sputum examination, the search for pneumococcal and legionella urinary antigens are of good diagnostic value. An associated COPD may lead to an acute respiratory failure. Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis results from various causes but infection is involved in about 50% of the cases, mostly viral and most often due to a rhinovirus. Viral infection can be associated to bacterial infection and the most frequently isolated germs are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. Severity assessment relies on the value of basal FEV1 that is often non available. Therefore Afssaps suggests using a dyspnea index to assess exacerbation severity.
ee48061797d29eeef5a9e606841bf8ab04b1d75b	Defining the connections among neurons is critical to our understanding of the structure and function of the nervous system. Recombinant viruses engineered to transmit across synapses provide a powerful approach for the dissection of neuronal circuitry in vivo. We recently demonstrated that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can be endowed with anterograde or retrograde transsynaptic tracing ability by providing the virus with different glycoproteins. Here we extend the characterization of the transmission and gene expression of recombinant VSV (rVSV) with the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G), and provide examples of its activity relative to the anterograde transsynaptic tracer form of rVSV. rVSV with RABV-G was found to drive strong expression of transgenes and to spread rapidly from neuron to neuron in only a retrograde manner. Depending upon how the RABV-G was delivered, VSV served as a polysynaptic or monosynaptic tracer, or was able to define projections through axonal uptake and retrograde transport. In animals co-infected with rVSV in its anterograde form, rVSV with RABV-G could be used to begin to characterize the similarities and differences in connections to different areas. rVSV with RABV-G provides a flexible, rapid, and versatile tracing tool that complements the previously described VSV-based anterograde transsynaptic tracer.

726446d56a32046a90a3eb0980d237194501f3b9	Crowdsourcing platforms are widely used for collecting large amount of labeled data. Due to low-paid workers and inherent noise, the quality of acquired data could be easily degraded. To solve this, most previous studies have sought to infer the true answer from noisy labels in discrete multiple-choice tasks that ask workers to select one of several answer candidates. However, recent crowdsourcing tasks have become more complicated and usually consist of real-valued vectors. In this paper, we propose a novel inference algorithm for vector regression tasks which ask workers to provide accurate vectors such as image object localization and human posture estimation. Our algorithm can estimate the true answer of each task and a reliability of each worker by updating two types of messages iteratively. We also prove its performance bound which depends on the number of queries per task and the average quality of workers. Under a certain condition, we prove that its average performance becomes close to an oracle estimator which knows the reliability of every worker. Through extensive experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets, we verify that our algorithm are superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms.

Some of these biomolecules are related to the progression and even to the prognosis of the infection. Findings on the role of cytokine storm associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection can be useful in order to manage this highly virulent disease. COVID-19 disease, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is related to a series of physiopathological mechanisms that mobilize a wide variety of biomolecules, mainly immunological in nature. In the most severe cases, the prognosis can be markedly worsened by the hyperproduction of mainly proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-, and TNF-, preferentially targeting lung tissue. This study reviews published data on alterations in the expression of different cytokines in patients with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 who require admission to an intensive care unit. Data on the implication of cytokines in this disease and their effect on outcomes will support the design of more effective approaches to the management of COVID-19. Introduction COVID-19 is a is a novel -coronavirus caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is closely related to SARS-CoV. It is the third zoonotic disease by coronavirus to affect humans, following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [1,2]. The first cases of infection by this virus were reported in a shellfish market in south Wuhan in December 2019 [3], and it proved impossible to rule out human-human transmission. SARS-CoV-2 samples were detected in this market, but the infected animal species has not been definitively established at the time of writing [4]. One study proposed that snakes were more likely than other animals to be carriers [5], but subsequent research indicated that bats may be responsible for its transmission, given the close similarity (96.2% of genome sequence) between SARS-CoV-2 in bats and humans [6][7][8][9]. The basic reproductive number (R0) in China was reported to reach at least 2.2 [10, 11] . Human-human transmission started among family members, observing that 31.3 % of infected individuals in this first wave resided in Wuhan and that 72.3 % did not live there but had contact with people who did [12] . The mortality rate of the disease ranged between 2.2 and 2.84 %, and the mean age of non-survivors was 75 years [13, 14] . The mean interval between initial symptoms and death was 14 days (range, 6 -41 days) and was shorter (11.5 days) in patients aged ≥70 years [14] . The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 appear after an incubation period of around 5-6 days and most frequently include fever, coughing, and fatigue, with the possible onset of sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, diarrhea, dyspnea, and/or lymphopenia, among others [12, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Computed tomography images of patients with severe complications of COVID-19 reveal the presence of pneumonia although with abnormal characteristics, including RNAemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (TLR-7) present in endosomes. TLR-7 activation requires the production of TNF-, IL-12, and IL-6 to enable the generation of specific cytotoxic CD8 + T cells. This involves the formation of antigen-specific B cells and antibody production through CD4 + helper T cells [29] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
372c5fab99bbe7f7862304f94bfaebd3c02f1e1c	This study was performed to characterize respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Study samples included 402 respiratory specimens obtained from 358 clinical episodes that occurred in the 116 children of the 175 consecutive HSCT cohort at Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Korea from 2007 to 2010. Multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions were performed for rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, human coronavirus (hCoV), influenza viruses and human metapneumovirus. Viruses were identified in 89 clinical episodes that occurred in 58 patients. Among the 89 clinical episodes, frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus in 25 (28.1%), RSV in 23 (25.8%), PIV-3 in 16 (18.0%), adenovirus in 12 (13.5%), and hCoV in 10 (11.2%). Lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 34 (38.2%). Neutropenia was present in 24 (27.0%) episodes and lymphopenia was in 31 (34.8%) episodes. Sixty-three percent of the clinical episodes were hospital-acquired. Three patients died of respiratory failure caused by respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viral infections in pediatric patients who have undergone HSCT are common and are frequently acquired during hospitalization. Continuous monitoring is required to determine the role of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised children and the importance of preventive strategies.
84c8e2af378f1f9d6ee059196e70ea64cb4dc7b7	As of April 18, 2020, there have been a total of 10,653 confirmed cases and 232 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 in Korea. The pathogen spread quickly, and the outbreak caused nationwide anxiety and shock. This study presented the anecdotal records that provided a detailed process of the multidisciplinary teamwork in mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Psychosocial support is no less important than infection control during an epidemic, and collaboration and networking are at the core of disaster management. Thus, a multidisciplinary team of mental health professionals was immediately established and has collaborated effectively with its internal and external stakeholders for psychosocial support during the COVID-19 outbreak.
407efcba93e1b021b6556011cf2f9997ee108a8f	Background: Early diagnosis and treatment is vital for effective tuberculosis (TB) management especially among migrant populations who are a vulnerable group. We aimed to study factors associated with delay before registration at country level among registered migrant TB patients in China (2014-15) who were transferred out (during treatment) through web-based TB information management system (TBIMS). Methods: This was a cross sectional study involving review of TBIMS data. Delays (in days) were classified as follows: patient delay (from symptom onset to first doctor visit), health system delay (from first doctor visit to treatment initiation, divided into health system diagnosis and treatment delay before and after date of diagnosis respectively), diagnosis delay (from symptom onset to diagnosis) and total delay (from symptom onset to treatment initiation). Linear regression was used to build a predictive model (forward stepwise) for the socio-demographic, clinical and health system related factors associated with delay: one model for each type of delay. Delays were log transformed and included in the model. The median (IQR) patient delay, health system delay and total delay was 16 (6, 34), two (0, 6) and 22 (11, 41) days respectively. Factors associated with long patient, diagnosis and total delay were: female gender, age ≥ 65 years, sputum smear positive pulmonary TB and registration at referral hospital. Treatment initiation delay was significantly higher among those registered in referral hospitals, unemployed and previously treated. Among migrant patients having permanent residence out of province, health system diagnosis delay was significantly higher while treatment initiation delay after diagnosis was significantly lower when compared to patients having permanent residence within the prefecture. Conclusion: Among migrant population with TB, patient delay contributed to the total delay. The factors identified including the need for improved coordination between referral hospitals and national programme have to be addressed if China has to end TB.
59567457a5b9e01dd9794bb629787b4f93c31a5f	COVID-19 is a worldwide epidemic, as announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Machine learning (ML) methods can play vital roles in identifying COVID-19 patients by visually analyzing their chest x-ray images. In this paper, a new MLmethod proposed to classify the chest x-ray images into two classes, COVID-19 patient or non-COVID-19 person. The features extracted from the chest x-ray images using new Fractional Multichannel Exponent Moments (FrMEMs). A parallel multi-core computational framework utilized to accelerate the computational process. Then, a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization based on differential evolution used to select the most significant features. The proposed method evaluated using two COVID-19 x-ray datasets. The proposed method achieved accuracy rates of 96.09% and 98.09% for the first and second datasets, respectively. Image moments defined as projections of image functions onto a polynomial basis where the image moments used to extract global and local features from these images [18] . Generally, projection of digital images using orthogonal polynomials with fractional orders results in orthogonal moments of fractional orders which able to extract both coarse and fine features PLOS ONE
bbbae593546dd68dc7abb6802443bbd5d0926ba3	Accurate registration of CT and CBCT images is key for adaptive radiotherapy. A particular challenge is the alignment of flexible organs, such as bladder or rectum, that often yield extreme deformations. In this work we analyze the impact of so-called structure guidance for learning based registration when additional segmentation information is provided to a neural network. We present a novel weakly supervised deep learning based method for multi-modal 3D deformable CT-CBCT registration with structure guidance constraints. Our method is not supervised by ground-truth deformations and we use the energy functional of a variational registration approach as loss for training. Incorporating structure guidance constraints in our learning based approach results in an average Dice score of 0.91 ± 0.08 compared to a score of 0.76 ± 0.15 for the same method without constraints. An iterative registration approach with structure guidance results in a comparable average Dice score of 0.91 ± 0.09. However, learning based registration requires only a single pass through the network, yielding computation of a deformation fields in less than 0.1 s which is more than 100 times faster than the runtime of iterative registration.
a1664d44233ab8b497b7e7e21d8d47c50e8d8cf6	A cross-sectional online survey was conducted within 36 hours after the first confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) case was reported in Hong Kong. To ensure good coverage of the general community in Hong Kong, chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of all eighteen district councils and all individual councilors of the 452 District Council Constituency Areas (DCCAs) were approached by electronic mails and their contact numbers listed in the District Council Web sites (https://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/index.html) for survey dissemination. District councilors were invited to share our survey link and promotion messages on their webpages, social media platforms or any channels which they usually use to convey information to their targeted residents, but in general there was no restriction on their dissemination. Individuals who were aged 18 or above, understood Chinese and lived (on average) over 5 days per week in Hong Kong in the last month were eligible to participate. Respondents were compensated with a HKD10 cash coupon if they indicated willingness for receipt. To avoid duplicated responses from the same respondent, the survey could only be taken once from the same electronic device. To start this survey, respondents were asked to indicate their willingness for participation by answering this first question "Are you willing to participate?." Only those who answered "Yes" could go on with the survey. Respondents were asked about their demographics (including sex, age, living district, education attainment, household income), self-perceived health status, travel history in the past month, occurrence of respiratory symptoms in the past fourteen days. The scales and response sets of these measures are self-explanatory in the respective result tables. Respondents were also

The main role of the capsid is to protect the viral genome against external aggressions, facilitating its safe and efficient encapsulation and delivery. As a consequence, viral capsids have developed astonishing mechanical properties that are crucial for viral function. These remarkable properties have started to be unveiled in singlevirus nanoindentation experiments, and are opening the door to the use of viral-derived artificial nanocages for promising bio-and nano-technological applications. However, the interpretation of nanoindentation experiments is often difficult, requiring the support of theoretical and simulation analysis. Here we present a 'Virtual AFM' (VAFM), a Brownian Dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model of virus aimed to mimic the standard setup of atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments. Despite the heavy level of coarse-graining, these simulations provide valuable information which is not accessible in experiments. Rather than focusing on a specific virus, the VAFM will be used to analyze how the mechanical response and breaking of viruses depend on different parameters controlling the effective interactions between capsid's structural units. In particular, we will discuss the influence of adsorption, the tip radius, and the rigidity and shape of the shell on its mechanical response.

687de6cf82aefd55aa87b700efd1b7b7bd8499ff	Applying lung protective mechanical ventilation (LPV) during general anaesthesia even in patients with non-injured lungs is recommended. However, the effects of an individual PEEP-optimisation on respiratory mechanics, oxygenation and their potential correlation with the inflammatory response and postoperative complications have not been evaluated have not been compared to standard LPV in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Thirty-nine patients undergoing open radical cystectomy were enrolled in this study. In the study group (SG) optimal PEEP was determined by a decremental titration procedure and defined as the PEEP value resulting the highest static pulmonary compliance. In the control group (CG) PEEP was set to 6 cmH2O. Primary endpoints were intraoperative respiratory mechanics and gas exchange parameters. Secondary outcomes were perioperative procalcitonin kinetics and postoperative pulmonary complications. Optimal PEEP levels (median = 10, range: 8-14 cmH2O), PaO2/FiO2 (451.24 ± 121.78 mmHg vs. 404.15 ± 115.87 mmHg, P = 0.005) and static pulmonary compliance (52.54 ± 13.59 ml cmH2O-1 vs. 45.22 ± 9.13 ml cmH2O-1, P < 0.0001) were significantly higher, while driving pressure (8.26 ± 1.74 cmH2O vs. 9.73 ± 4.02 cmH2O, P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the SG as compared to the CG. No significant intergroup differences were found in procalcitonin kinetics (P = 0.076). Composite outcome results indicated a non-significant reduction of postoperative complications in the SG. Intraoperative PEEP-optimization resulted in significant improvement in gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics as compared to standard LPV. Whether these have any effect on short and long term outcomes require further investigations. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT02931409.

a403b805f70f5f3ec4e9b3693ac6f27a9d72fdad	During the COVID-19 outbreak, it is essential to monitor the effectiveness of measures taken by governments on the course of the epidemic. Here we show that there is already a sufficient amount of data collected in Italy to predict the outcome of the process. We show that using the proper metric, the data from Hubei Province and Italy has striking similarity, which enables us to calculate the expected number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths by the end of the process. Our predictions will improve as new data points are generated day by day, which can help to make further public decisions. The method is based on the data analysis of logistic growth equations describing the process on the macroscopic level. At the time of writing of the first version, the number of fatalities in Italy was expected to be 6000, and the predicted end of the crisis was April 15, 2020. In this new version, we discuss what changed in the two weeks which passed since then. The trend changed drastically on March 17, 2020, when the Italian health system reached its capacity limit. Without this limit, probably 3500 more people would have died. Instead, due to the limitations, 17.000 people are expected to die now, which is a five-fold increase. The predicted end of the crisis now shifted to May 8, 2020.
b372f06397c2cf39ec1ed6109bcb45044132976d	Early life infection with RSV is associated with development and exacerbations of asthma. Airway vascularity and pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, bFGF, angiogenins) are upregulated in the airways of asthmatics. We investigated whether early life pneumoviral infection leads to the development of pulmonary angiogenesis, and whether this is due to viral-induced up-regulation of proangiogenic factors in the lung. Methods Lung tissues were collected following primary or secondary infection of newborn BALB/c mice with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Viral titre and expression levels of pro-angiogenic factors in lungs were determined by qPCR. Angiogenesis was quantified by immunohistochemistry using the angiogenic markers CD31 (PCAM-1) and von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Results Angiogenesis was apparent 14 days post infection (dpi) (CD31 = 0.3 Ϯ 0.1, vWF = 0.2 Ϯ 0.2), peaked at 28 dpi (CD31 = 30.8 Ϯ 3.6, vWF = 38.4 Ϯ 5.3) and regressed by 35 dpi (CD31 = 0.3 Ϯ 0.3, vWF = 0). A secondary infection at day 82 re-activated angiogenesis by day 96 (vWF = 46.8 Ϯ 6.7). Detection of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, Ang1 and Tie2) in the lung correlated with the observed angiogenesis. Conclusions Early life pneumoviral infection induces the development of angiogenesis which is spatially associated with the airways. This model is the first to demonstrate a specific link between early life respiratory viral infection and the induction of angiogenesis in the lung. A Th1 response has been considered to be protective for asthma, on the basis that it might antagonize the dominant Th2 response. However, there is increasing evidence that under certain circumstances, Th1 cells are involved in the induction of asthmatic manifestations and can potentiate pathological responses. The mechanisms by which Th1 cells are involved in asthma remain unclear. We assessed the interaction between Th1 cells and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the induction of airway hyper-reactivity (AHR). Methods Antigen-specific DO11.10 Th1 or Th2 cells were generated in vitro, in the presence of OVA 323-359 peptide with IL-12/anti-IL-4 or IL-4/anti-IFNg respectively. Antigen-specific Th1 or Th2 cells (5¥10 6 ) were injected intravenously and followed by intranasal challenge with 10 mg OVA 323-359 daily for 4 consecutive days. Some groups of animals that received Th1 cells were administered 50 ng LPS together with the last OVA 323-359 challenge. Other groups were treated with anti-IFNg, dexamethasone or cytotoxic antibody to deplete neutrophils. Results Antigen-specific Th1 cells alone did not induce airway inflammation or AHR in mice challenged with OVA . Additional treatment with LPS resulted in significantly increased airway reactivity and neutrophil infiltration into the lung. Neutralization studies showed that the interplay of LPS and IFNg underpinned this response, which was steroid-resistant. Neutrophils recruited into the lung were not responsible for induction of AHR. Conclusions Our investigation establishes that an interaction between antigen-specific Th1 cells and LPS is required to induce AHR in this experimental model. Importantly, this AHR is steroid-resistant and is critically dependent on IFNg. Rationale Inflammatory mechanisms play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. The bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an important vascular modulator. Methods Mice deficient in one of the two S1P synthesizing sphingosine kinase (SK) isoforms, SK1, and the corresponding wild-type mice (wt, C57/Bl6) were employed. Allergen-evoked airway inflammation was induced by longterm recurrent ovalbumin-exposure and the effects of SK1-deficiency on lung vasculature were investigated. Results Under inflammatory conditions, quantitative RT-PCR showed upregulated pulmonary levels of eotaxin mRNA in SK1-KO as compared to naïve mice, whereas mRNA-expression of IL-4 as well as S1P-synthesizing and degrading enzymes was unaltered. BAL of chronically inflamed SK1deficient mice contained more cells in total and a larger number of CD68positive macrophages/monocytes as compared to BAL of wt lungs. Following allergen-exposure, a remarkable remodelling of intraacinar vessels and small pulmonary arteries with longitudinally orientated smooth muscle cells luminal to the internal elastic membrane was observed in SK1-KO mice as compared to wt mice. Using isolated ventilated mouse lungs perfused with the thromboxane receptor agonist U46619, vascular hyperresponsiveness was observed in allergen-exposed lungs from wt and SK1-KO mice, with higher vascular responsiveness of SK1-KO lungs. Conclusion Absence of SK1 increased alterations in morphology and function of pulmonary arteries under chronic inflammatory conditions suggesting a possible role of the SK1/S1P system in the pathobiology of inflammationassociated pulmonary arterial hypertension. Recently, it has been shown that Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) respiratory infection may inhibit the development of inflammatory responses associated with allergic lung diseases such as asthma. In this study we investigated the potential of current human Spn-based vaccines to suppress ovalbumin (OVA)induced allergic airways disease (AAD) using mouse models. Methods AAD was induced in 6-8 wk old female BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal sensitization with Th2-inducing adjvant (alum) on day 0 and intranasal challenge with OVA on day 12-15. AAD was assessed on day 16. Mice were administered with Prevenar or Pneumovax with and without Th1-inducing adjuvant (CpG) at the time of OVA-sensitization. The effects of Spn vaccines on the development of hallmark features of AAD were determined. Results Prevenar significantly decreased eosinophil influx into the lung and airways hyperresponsiveness compared to untreated allergic controls. Furthermore lymph node cell cultures stimulated with OVA showed a significant decrease in Th2 cytokine release. Pneumovax had no effect on AAD. CpGs in combination with vaccines had no additional effect. Conclusions Prevenar may have potential applications as a therapy for the suppression of allergic lung disease such as asthma. Support Asthma NSW, HMRI, Asthma CRC. This work is the subject of a patent application. The underlying biological processes involved in airway remodelling are still poorly understood and scientific progress in this area has been restricted by the lack of a suitable experimental model. Sheep have been widely used as models for lung development and pulmonary diseases including asthma. We have developed an experimental sheep model of human asthma based on house dust mite (HDM) that displays many of the hallmark features of the human disease including raised IgE levels, eosinophilia and increased airway mucus production. Repeated (chronic) allergen challenges in this model result in airway tissue remodelling with increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) and collagen, and deteriorating lung function. In light of the inherent difficulties in obtaining ASM from human lung biopsies, the sheep HDM asthma model provides a platform for relevant functional studies of ASM under different experimental conditions. Ovine ASM cultures from the trachealis muscle were established by explant culture or following enzymatic dissociation, and cells examined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry at passages 2-5. Cultured ovine ASM cells showed differential serum growth responses and displayed typical morphological features of smooth muscle cells, with positive immunoreactivity for smooth muscle-specific a-actin and desmin. Preliminary comparative studies of the phenotypic and functional properties of ASM at different airway levels from asthmatic and non-asthmatic animals are underway. These studies highlight the potential for this highly relevant translational model to study changes in ASM while monitoring the kinetics of the asthmatic response and, given the longevity of sheep, its use as a tool for assessing chronic disease and long-term therapeutic procedures. Airway remodelling is a set of structural changes in asthma that has been suggested as a novel target for the treatment of severe and persistent asthma. Mice deficient in the antifibrotic hormone relaxin develop age-related changes similar to airway remodelling, including severe bronchial fibrosis. We used an established murine model of chronic allergic airways disease to examine the effect of treatment with exogenous relaxin on airway remodelling and airway hyperresponsiveness. Methods A chronic ovalbumin allergic airways disease model was induced in 8 week old female Balb/c mice. Following the ovalbumin aerosol challenge period, mice were treated with recombinant H2 relaxin (0.8 mg/ml) or vehicle control via s.c. mini-osmotic pumps. Two weeks later airway hyperresponsiveness was assessed, tissues collected and airway inflammatory and remodelling parameters measured. Results Recombinant relaxin administered systemically was able to reverse collagen deposition around the airways to levels seen in saline control animals. This resulted in reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness measured by invasive plethysmography. Relaxin-treated mice did not exhibit changes in bronchoalveolar fluid inflammatory cells or in goblet cell hyperplasia compared to untreated ovalbumin animals. Matrix metalloprotease levels were increased, a likely mechanism for the antifibrotic effect. Conclusions Relaxin was able to dramatically reduce airway remodelling in a chronic mouse model of allergic airways disease. Relaxin treatment also resulted in reduced airway hyperresponsiveness. Further trials are warranted to investigate the efficacy of relaxin in the treatment of allergic airways disease. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) via the subcutaneous route is an established treatment for respiratory allergies but is associated with severe systemic reactions. Sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) is a promising alternative to SIT with improved safety. However, the immune mechanisms have not been delineated and there is therefore a need for experimental models. We compared efficacy of SLIT with whole allergen protein versus allergen immunodominant peptide in an experimental asthma model. Methods BALB/c mice received the model allergen ovalbumin (OVA; OVA-SLIT mice) or OVA323-339 immunodominant peptide sublingually prior to intraperitoneal sensitization with OVA in alum. Mice were challenged intranasally with OVA, or fluorescent OVA to identify APC which had endocytosed allergen, and immunological parameters analysed 24 hours later. Results SLIT-OVA mice had markedly decreased airway eosinophilia, frequency of draining lymph node (LN) cells producing the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and concentrations of airway TGF-b and serum OVA-specific IgE. SLIT with OVA323-339 was less effective. Compared to OVA sensitized and challenged mice, SLIT-OVA mice had altered proportions of allergen-laden CD11c + CD11b + lung dendritic cells (DC), and decreased DC expression of MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 in lung and lungdraining LN. Conclusions SLIT decreased key clinical asthma symptoms, associated with altered pulmonary DC maturation and allergen uptake. Our model will be useful for further defining SLIT mechanisms of action. Background The flexiVent small animal ventilator (SCIREQ, Canada) allows measurement of detailed respiratory mechanics on animals as small as 10g. It uses the forced oscillation technique (FOT) to measure respiratory system impedence (Zrs) by applying a signal containing 19 mutually prime sinusoidal frequencies ranging from 0.25 to 19.625 Hz at the airway opening. The constant phase model (CPM) is fit to Zrs to calculate airway resistance (Raw) tissue damping (G) and tissue elastance (H). The default settings of flexiVent apply an unweighted (absolute) fitting of the CPM to the Zrs spectra. This may not be appropriate for mice with severe lung disease. Methods Adult female BALB/c mice with influenza-induced lung disease were challenged with methacholine (MCh). Data were analysed using the default "primewave" settings of flexiVent v5.1. These same data were then adjusted to remove the two lowest frequencies (0.25 and 0.625 Hz) and a relative (weighted) fitting of the CPM was applied. Results The default analysis produced a poor model fit and uninterpretable measurements of Raw, G and H, especially at higher MCh concentrations. Applying the weighted fitting improved the application of the CPM to Zrs spectra. A better partitioning of the CPM into airway and tissue compartments was achieved by removing the lowest two frequencies from the analysis. Conclusion The default flexiVent settings provided by SCIREQ are not suitable for accurate measurement of lung mechanics in mouse models of severe lung disease. Chlamydial lung infections are linked with asthma but the nature of the association is obscure. We have demonstrated that an ongoing, but not cleared, chlamydial lung infection at the time of allergen sensitization promotes a skew from a Th2 to a mixed Th1/Th2 allergen-specific T-cell response that promotes neutrophilic and suppresses eosinophilic inflammation. During this neutrophildominated allergic airways disease (AAD), goblet cell hyperplasia and AHR are reduced but still present. The resulting phenotype has features similar to neutrophilic asthma in humans. We examined whether pulmonary neutrophil influx during infection plays an important role in the ability of an ongoing infection to induce AAD with this phenotype. Mice were treated intra-peritoneally (IP) with both anti-keratinocyte chemokine (aKC) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and anti-macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (aMIP2) mAb, 3, 5, 7 and 9 days after inoculation with Chlamydia muridarum (Cmu). This treatment regime resulted in decreased pulmonary, but not systemic, neutrophilia during infection. Seven days after inoculation, mice were sensitized to Ovalbumin (Ova) by IP injection. AAD was induced by daily intranasal Ova challenges 12-15 days after sensitization. On day 16, key features of AAD were characterized and compared to non-antibody treated controls. Depletion of pulmonary neutrophilia during infection abrogated the Chlamydiamediated reduction in Ova-specific IL-5 release from T cells from the lung, goblet cell hyperplasia and AHR during AAD. Furthermore infected treated animals no longer mounted a robust pulmonary or systemic neutrophil response upon the induction of AAD despite cessation of antibody treatment 7 days earlier. Ongoing chlamydial respiratory infections substantially modify key allergenspecific immune responses in AAD with the composition of cellular inflammatory responses to infection crucial in determining the outcome of allergic phenotype. NA is characterized by the presence of neutrophilic lung inflammation. Hi colonization has been shown in some people with NA, however it is not known if colonization induces NA or if these patients are predisposed to colonization. We investigated the nature of this association using mouse models of lung infection and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway disease (AAD). Methods Mice were infected 10 days before (Before), the same day as (During) or 10 days after (After) intraperitoneal OVA sensitization. AAD was induced by intranasal OVA challenge 12-15 days after sensitization, then characterized on day 16. Lung-draining lymph nodes (LN) were restimulated with killed Hi or OVA and IL-5, -13 and IFN-g release was determined. Eosinophils and neutrophils were enumerated in bronchoalveolar lavage and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) was assessed by measurement of airways resistance and dynamic compliance following methacholine administration. The induction of AAD after infection inhibited Hi clearance and increased and decreased Hi-specific IL-5 and IFN-g, respectively. In all groups infection decreased OVA-specific IL-5, -13 and IFN-g and eosinophil influx into the lung but increased neutrophil recruitment and did not significantly alter AHR. Conclusion This combined model of AAD and Hi infection is consistent with the clinical phenotype of NA and supports our hypothesis that Hi infection may lead to the development of NA. Early life exposure to viral lower respiratory illness is thought to exacerbate the development of allergic airways disease such as asthma. There are few published murine models of respiratory virus infection in infants and neonates. This study aimed to characterize the inflammatory and physiological pattern of Influenza A infection in infant mice. Methods Infant BALB/c mice were inoculated on day 7 (d7) with 10mL 10 3.8 pfu Influenza virus A/Mem/1/71 (H3N1) or media control. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected at d1-5, 7, 10, 14 & 21 post-inoculation to determine the inflammatory profile. Following the establishment of peak inflammation and clearance, physiology was assessed during the acute inflammatory period (d5-post-inoculation) and resolution of infection (d21) using a small animal ventilator and a modification of the forced oscillation technique. The Constant Phase Model was fitted to Respiratory Impedance data to produce airway and tissue mechanics. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was assessed to inhaled methacholine (MCh) (0.01-30 mg/mL) at d21. Results Cellular inflammation peaked at d3 in Influenza infected mice (1.23 ¥ 10 6 (0.23) cells/mL) compared to control animals (2.79 ¥ 10 5 (0.29) cells/mL; p = 0.007) and had resolved to control levels by d14 (1.65 ¥ 10 5 (0.48) cells/mL vs 1.53 ¥ 10 5 (0.22) cells/mL; p = 0.837). Mice infected with Influenza A virus showed changes to baseline mechanics at d5, and AHR to inhaled MCh (p = 0.01) at d21 compared to control animals. Conclusions These findings confirm that Influenza A virus induces significant changes in baseline mechanics during acute infection in infant mice, and that AHR persists beyond the resolution of inflammation. The ligand-activated transcription factor proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) has been implicated in both inflammatory and remodelling processes in asthma. We have previously shown that the PPARg ligand rosiglitazone (RGZ) reduces airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in a murine model of allergen-induced inflammation without inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration [1] . The hypothesis that RGZ reduces AHR by directly causing airway smooth muscle (ASM) relaxation was tested by measuring contractility of small airways in mouse lung slices in which in situ organization is maintained. Methods C57BL/6 mice were killed by sodium pentobarbitone overdose (i.p.), the trachea cannulated and chest cavity opened. The lungs were inflated with liquid agarose that solidifies to stiffen the tissue for sectioning (~130 mm) [2]. The effects of RGZ (1-100 mM) +/-PPARg antagonist (GW9662 1 mM) on small airway contraction in response to a submaximal concentration of methacholine (MCh, 300 nM) were assessed. RGZ was also tested after pretreatment with ryanodine (50 mM) and caffeine (20 mM) to elicit a sustained high [Ca 2+ ]i within ASM. Under these conditions, MCh-induced contraction occurs without a change in the [Ca 2+ ]i via Ca 2+ sensitization. Results The MCh-induced contraction (40% reduction in lumen area) was reversed in a concentration-dependent manner by RGZ. This acute relaxation to RGZ (EC50 < 30 mM, complete relaxation 100 mM, n = 7) was not prevented by GW9662. Following ryanodine-caffeine treatment, which elicited transient airways contraction followed by relaxation, subsequent contractions to MCh were also sensitive to RGZ. Conclusions The novel bronchodilator action of RGZ in murine small airways may be PPARg-independent. Its mechanism of this action in this preparation is likely to involve inhibition of both MCh-induced increases in [Ca 2+ ]i and Ca 2+ sensitization of ASM. Asthmatic airways are highly sensitive to a number of stimuli. The reason underlying this increased sensitivity is poorly understood. A previous study found that sensitivity to acetylcholine relates to the diffusion distance of the drug. We hypothesize that drug-diffusion distance would only influence drugsensitivity if the drug is metabolized while diffusing to its target. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between diffusion distance and sensitivity to carbachol (CCh), which acts on the same receptors as ACh, but is not as easily metabolized. Methods 22 airway segments (tubes) with a range of internal diameters (1.4 to 6.3 mm; surrogate for diffusion distance) were dissected from 13 female pig lungs. Cumulative concentration curves were generated to carbachol applied to the outside surface of tubes. Sensitivity was measured as the negative logconcentration of carbachol that would cause a half-maximal increase in luminal pressure/response (-EC50). ID measurements were made from images of stained cross sections (8 mm) cut from cryo-imbedded segments. Results There was no significant correlation (n = 22, r~0, p > 0.05) between ID and -EC50 to CCh. Conclusions Agonists need to be metabolically unstable, such as acetylcholine, for airway size to influence sensitivity. The smaller diffusion distance between the luminal epithelium or mast cells and the airway smooth muscle may in part account for the increased sensitivity in asthma. It is now recognized that long-term structural and functional changes to lung tissues (airway remodelling) in chronic asthmatics causes significant increases in morbidity. We have previously shown that repeated challenges of House Dust Mite (HDM) to sheep lungs results in significant remodelling of the airways. We now assess remodelling of the bronchial vascular compartment of the airways of sheep chronically challenged with HDM. Methods Infusions of HDM were administered to specific lung segments of allergic sheep, once weekly over a six month period. The equivalent segment in the opposite lung was used as an untreated internal control. The bronchiolar airway walls were assessed for vascularity by computer-assisted morphometric analysis of Masson's Trichrome stained histological sections. Results Analysis of the morphometric data revealed that in some sheep there were statistically significant increases in the number of blood vessels in the bronchiolar airway walls in HDM challenged lung segments compared to the untreated internal control lung segments (88% increase p < 0.05, 38% increase p < 0.05). When assessed as a group, there was on average a 41% greater number of vessels in bronchiolar walls of HDM treated lung segments compared to the average number of vessels in untreated control lung segments (n = 4 sheep). The total vascular area in bronchiolar walls was on average 54% greater in HDM segments compared with untreated control segments (n = 4 sheep). Conclusion These preliminary results show that the sheep model can be useful for the study of the mechanisms underlying vascular remodelling in chronic asthma. Introduction It is unclear whether mast cell counts in endobronchial biopsy specimens of proximal airways are related to mast cell counts in the small airways. Aim To compare mast cell density in endobronchial biopsy sections with mast cell density in transverse sections of small airways using stereological methods. Method Lungs were obtained post-mortem from 10 subjects who died of non-respiratory causes and fixed in inflation. Three-dimensional (3D) mast cell densities (cells/mm 3 ) were determined on endobronchial biopsies and transverse sections of small airways using an optical disector on 30mm thick histological sections, stained with human anti-mast cell tryptase. Results Mean 3D mast cell density over the inner airway wall in biopsies was significantly related to mean mast cell density over the total airway wall in the small airways (r~0.80, p < 0.01). A minimum of three biopsies per case was required to demonstrate this relationship. Within relevant count areas, 3D mast cell density was about 1.6 times higher in the small airways than in the biopsies. Conclusion These findings suggest that inter-subject comparisons of mean mast cell density in the inner airway wall in endobronchial biopsies will tend to reflect inter-subject comparisons of mean mast cell density over the total airway wall in small airways. This is despite mast cell densities being generally higher in the small airways. However, mean counts from at least three biopsies per case are required to accurately represent inter-subject comparisons. Introduction Mast cell density in the inner airway wall on endobronchial biopsies from proximal airways reflects inter-subject comparisons of mean mast cell density in both the large airways and the small airways. However, whether it is also related to mast cell density in the lung as a whole is unknown. Aim To compare the density of mast cells in endobronchial biopsy sections with the density of mast cells in the lung as a whole using stereological methods. Method Lungs were obtained post-mortem from 10 subjects who died of non-respiratory causes and fixed in inflation. Mean three-dimensional (3D) mast cell density (cells/mm 3 ) in the inner airway wall in endobronchial biopsies was determined using an optical disector on 30 mm thick histological sections stained with human anti-mast cell tryptase. 3D mast cell density in the whole lung was determined by estimating total mast cell number in the lung with the fractionator technique and normalizing this against estimated tissue volume in the lung. Results 3D mast cell density in the lung as a whole was systematically lower than that in biopsies but, on average, was of a similar order of magnitude (10 3 cells/mm 3 ) to that in biopsies. Mast cell density in biopsies was not significantly correlated with mast cell density in the lung as a whole (r = 0.10). Conclusion These findings suggest that mast cell counts in biopsies from proximal airways are not related to mast cell density in the lung as a whole. Age is an important factor in the development of neutrophilic airway diseases such as neutrophilic asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The immune response changes with age, however alterations to neutrophil function that occur during healthy ageing are not well understood. Aim To investigate age related changes in the innate immune responses of airway and circulating neutrophils. Methods Healthy subjects (n = 13) aged 26 to 77 years underwent sputum induction and blood collection. Neutrophils were isolated from induced sputum and peripheral blood samples using magnetic cell separation and CD16 microbeads. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 1% FCS with or without LPS stimulation (100ng/mL). IL-8, IL-1b, TNF-a, and total MMP-9 protein was measured by ELISA, and relative gene expression of IL-8, IL-1b, TNF-a, TLR2 and TLR4 was measured by real-time PCR. Results Participants were divided into 2 groups by the median age (55 years). Airway neutrophils from older subjects (>55 years) released significantly more TNF-a protein and had significantly higher levels of mRNA for TLR2, IL-8, IL-1b and TNF-a compared to younger subjects (p < 0.05). Resting blood neutrophils from older subjects had significantly higher levels of MMP-9 release and TLR4 mRNA compared to younger subjects (p < 0.05). Blood neutrophils from older subjects stimulated with the innate immune agonist LPS released significantly less IL-1b and TNF-a protein compared to younger subjects (p < 0.05). Conclusion There are distinct alterations in neutrophil function that occur during healthy ageing. Alterations in the innate immune response are characterized by an enhanced spontaneous activation of both airway and circulating neutrophils, and an impaired response of circulating neutrophils to LPS stimulation. Neutrophils play a crucial role in innate immunity and contribute significantly to airway inflammation in neutrophilic asthma. The mechanisms of neutrophilic asthma remain unknown, however activation of the innate immune response is implicated. Aim To investigate the innate immune response of isolated airway neutrophils in subtypes of asthma. Methods Participants with asthma (n = 17) and healthy controls (n = 11) underwent sputum induction. Selected sputum samples were dispersed with DTT and airway neutrophils were isolated using magnetic cell separation with CD16 microbeads. Neutrophils were cultured in RPMI 1640 1% FCS for 24 hours. IL-8, and TNF-a protein was measured by ELISA, and relative gene expression of IL-8, TNF-a, TLR4 and TLR2 was measured by real-time PCR. Results Airway neutrophils isolated from subjects with neutrophilic asthma released lower levels of IL-8 (p = 0.055) and significantly lower levels of TNF-a (p = 0.0038) protein compared to healthy controls. Airway neutrophils isolated from participants with neutrophilic asthma also had significantly decreased levels of IL-8 mRNA (p = 0.03) and lower levels of TNF-a mRNA (p = 0.049). This reduced cytokine release was linked with a decreased TLR4 and TLR2 gene expression, which was 4 and 2.9 fold down-regulated, respectively in neutrophilic asthma compared to healthy controls. Conclusion Airway neutrophil innate immune cytokine responses are impaired in neutrophilic asthma compared to healthy controls and this is linked with a decreased gene expression of TLR4 and TLR2. Dysfunction of airway neutrophils in neutrophilic asthma would impact on susceptibility to and severity of airway infections. Chronic airway inflammation in asthma is maintained by provision of survival signals to CD4 + T cells. CD40 and OX40 Ligand (OX40L) are cell surface molecules expressed on airway smooth muscle (ASM) that enhance CD4 + T cell activation and survival. We examined the effect of the cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interferon-gamma (IFN-g) on CD40 and OX40L expression. Methods Cell-surface CD40 and OX40L expression on human ASM in culture from asthmatic (n = 13) and non-asthmatic (n = 14) donors following stimulation with TNF-a and IFN-g was measured using cell surface ELISA. In some experiments, inhibitors of signalling pathways were also added. Results TNF-a and IFN-g synergistically increased CD40 expression to a greater extent than either cytokine alone. This phenomenon was greater on asthmatic (n = 8) than non-asthmatic (n = 9) ASM (p < 0.01). In contrast, TNF-a and IFN-g did not increase OX40L expression in comparison to TNF-a and IFN-g alone. The CD40 (p < 0.001, Non asthmatic) and OX40L expression (p < 0.01, Non asthmatic) induced following stimulation by TNF-a and IFN-g was reduced by the addition of c-jun N terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. CD40 (p < 0.05, non asthmatic) and OX40L (p < 0.05, non asthmatic) expression following TNF-a stimulation was increased by the addition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MMEK)-1 inhibitor PD98059. Conclusion Asthmatic ASM can potentially modulate airway inflammation by increasing expression of signalling molecules in response to cytokines. IFN-g may activate mechanisms for decreasing OX40L expression which may prevent maintenance of CD4 + T cell activation by ASM. We demonstrate a possible role for JNK as a relevant signalling molecule in airway inflammation. There is evidence to suggest that impairment in macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic inflammatory cells is a factor in the development of chronic inflammation in asthma. We have compared pulmonary macrophage ability to phagocytose apoptotic eosinophils in non-asthmatics and intermittent and persistent asthmatics. Methods Cross-sectional study of 37 young adults (current asthma 21; never asthma 16) randomly selected from a university-based general practice database. Study participants completed an asthma questionnaire, provided a blood sample from which apoptotic eosinophils were derived, and underwent spirometry with reversibility testing followed by sputum induction with hypertonic (4.5%) saline. Pulmonary macrophages were purified from sputum samples and incubated with apoptotic eosinophils for one hour. Percent macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells was determined from a cytospin. Results Median percent phagocytosis was higher in non-asthmatics compared with asthmatics (non-asthma 18.3%, IQR 11.6%; asthma 11.8%, IQR 13.8) and higher in intermittent asthmatics compared with persistent asthmatics (intermittent 11.8%, IQR 7.0%; persistent 9.3%, IQR 18.8%) although neither difference reached statistical significance. Conclusions These results suggest that impairment in macrophage phagocyctosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation in asthma. Introduction Asthma is a disease influenced by multiple environmental and genetic factors. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) can contribute to the development of asthma in predisposed individuals. Glutathione S-transferase enzymes (GSTs) are important in detoxification of ETS constituents. Deletion of the GSTM1 gene results in the absence of enzyme and thus loss of activity. The GSTM1 null genotype has been associated with asthma; however, this has not been previously examined in children with acute asthma. Aim To investigate if GSTM1 null influences asthma severity in acute asthmatic children who are exposed to household ETS. Methodology Children (n = 219), aged 2-16 years, were recruited on presentation with acute asthma and the severity of their attack assessed. Exposure to household ETS was determined via questionnaire data, and individuals were genotyped for the presence of GSTM1 using PCR. Results Children with GSTM1 null (mean severity score 9.83) did not experience more severe asthma than those with at least one copy of the gene (mean severity score 9.52, p = 0.39). The proportion of children with moderate/ severe asthma symptoms was not influenced by ETS exposure (non-ETS: 80.8%, ETS: 83.8%, p = 0.63). However, children with GSTM1 null and xposure to ETS had a 4.69-fold (95% CI 1.1 to 19.5) increased risk of experiencing moderate/severe symptoms, compared to children with GSTM1 who were not exposed to ETS (p = 0.033). Conclusions These data suggest that a combination of ETS exposure and deficiency in GSTM1 is associated with increased severity of acute asthma in children. One possible explanation for this might be reduced efficiency of ETS detoxification through the glutathione pathway. Introduction Dendritic cells (DC) are thought to be important in allergic diseases such as asthma, though little is known about features that distinguish DC from atopic and non-atopic individuals, nor the mechanisms by which DC induce or reinforce a Th2 response. We reasoned that a microarray screen of allergen-exposed DC would highlight novel allergy-associated genes. Methods Monocyte-derived DC were exposed to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen or LPS, and gene expression was analysed by microarray, RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Results Microarray analysis showed that allergen, but not LPS, enhanced thrombomodulin (CD141) expression by DC from atopic (n = 8), but not healthy individuals (n = 9), and was confirmed at both the mRNA (p = 0.037) and protein level (p = 0.030). FACS sorted CD141 + DC induced a strongly Th2polarized cytokine response by allergen specific T-cells in vitro, compared to DC lacking CD141 (n = 8). The in vivo relevance of these findings was confirmed by showing that more CD141 + DC were present in the blood of those with stable atopic asthma (n = 13), compared to healthy subjects (n = 15), and also that CD141 mRNA expression increased in blood leukocytes from children during an acute asthma exacerbation and waned at follow up 6 weeks later (n = 25). Conclusions These findings suggest for the first time that CD141 expression on DC may be involved in the pathogenesis of atopy and asthma.

d9df36bd2686eeb5fcdbb3cecf543e90ba217174	Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined as an acute-onset, progressive, hypoxic condition with radiographic bilateral lung infiltration, which develops after several diseases or injuries, and is not derived from hydrostatic pulmonary edema. One specific pathological finding of ARDS is diffuse alveolar damage. In 2012, in an effort to increase diagnostic specificity, a revised definition of ARDS was published in JAMA. However, no new parameters or biomarkers were adopted by the revised definition. Discriminating between ARDS and other similar diseases is critically important; however, only a few biomarkers are currently available for diagnostic purposes. Furthermore, predicting the severity, response to therapy, or outcome of the illness is also important for developing treatment strategies for each patient. However, the PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio is currently the sole clinical parameter used for this purpose. In parallel with progress in understanding the pathophysiology of ARDS, various humoral factors induced by inflammation and molecules derived from activated cells or injured tissues have been shown as potential biomarkers that may be applied in clinical practice. In this review, the current understanding of the basic pathophysiology of ARDS and associated candidate biomarkers will be discussed.
e483fdbda7f46cb9d94fdc826a6f78bea79ddf7c	In this letter the authors discuss the relationship between structure and random walk dynamics in directed complex networks, with an emphasis on identifying whether a topological hub is also a dynamical hub. They establish the necessary conditions for networks to be topologically and dynamically fully correlated ͑e.g., word adjacency and airport networks͒, and show that in this case Zipf's law is a consequence of the match between structure and dynamics. They also show that real-world neuronal networks and the world wide web are not fully correlated, implying that their more intensely connected nodes are not necessarily highly active.
e1453bea78424afaa6fd66d773da792ab8980f3a	Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the causative agent of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), characterized by high mortality and severely retarded growth in piglets that dramatically affects the porcine industry. Previously, we have identified two shRNA-expressing plasmids pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 that target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of TGEV with more than 95% of virus inhibition in vitro. In this study, inhibition of the TGEV replication by pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2 was tested in mini-pigs. SPF mini-pigs at 25 days old were injected with the shRNA-expressing plasmids and then infected with TGEV. The results from the analyses of clinical signs, histopathology, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and RT-PCR show that the two shRNA-expressing plasmids could significantly decrease the quantity of TGEV in different organs and protect mini-pigs from TGEV infection. These findings illustrate the prospect for TGEV-specific shRNAs to be new anti-TGEV agents. Crown
eea99edd3e46e56abb812a2b60448ce72dbe1270	Teschoviruses are emerging pathogens, belonging to the family Picornaviridae, and infects porcine population only. Among all, porcine teschoviruses (PTVs) are of high prominence leading to clinical illness and consequent economic loss to the livestock sector. These are associated with extremely lethal non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis (Teschen disease) and are distributed world over. Its milder form, Talfan disease, inflicts low morbidity and mortality and general clinical disease. The first epizootics of Teschen disease occurred in 1929 in the Czech Republic. Mature virions are small (23-30 nm) and stable in environmental conditions (pH range 2-9, heat, lipid solvents). Genetic variations in the major surface protein, VP1, lead to the evolution of several new types. As of now, 13
4c405d77016269da8a21b9c1fe1581cd2066b6ed	A blinded, randomized, controlled, multi-centric field study was conducted on French dairy farms (n = 9) to evaluate the long term efficacy of metaphylactic, single oral treatments with either 1 mg/kg body weight (BW) of diclazuril (Vecoxan ® ), or 15 mg/kg BW of toltrazuril (Baycox ® ) against natural infections with Eimeria zuernii and/or Eimeria bovis, compared to untreated control animals. A total of 199 calves from nine commercial farms aged between 21 and 55 days old at the start of study were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Calves on all farms were observed for a period of 78 days post treatment, using both parasitological (oocyst excretion), and clinical parameters (faecal score and body weight). The assessment of efficacy was based on both control of oocyst excretion, and on the average daily weight gains throughout the study. During the whole study period, the mean number of days with diarrhoea (≥2) was similar (0.7 days) between treated groups. Excretion in the untreated group peaked at 21 days after treatment. In both the diclazuril and toltrazuril-treated groups, mean oocyst excretion decreased dramatically in the five days following treatment. Thereafter, particularly towards the end of the study period, oocyst counts and percentage levels of E. zuernii were highest in the toltrazuril-treated group. In pooled data from all trial sites, the average daily weight gain was significantly (p = 0.01) higher (+0.057 kg/day) in the diclazuril group when compared to the toltrazuril group, and the average body weight gain of the diclazuril treated group was 4.4 kg higher than the toltrazuril group. On eight of the nine trial sites, the average daily gain was greater in the diclazuril group than in the toltrazuril group. This study demonstrates that, over an extended observation period of 78 days, metaphylactic treatment with both diclazuril and toltrazuril reduces the impact of coccidiosis, but greater performance benefits based on average daily weight gains, were achieved following the use of diclazuril.
1c556f1162e697315763326c3cb401999f9e1da4	A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of feline coronavirus (FCoV) messenger RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is described. The assay is evaluated as a diagnostic test for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). It is based on a well-documented key event in the development of FIP: the replication of virulent FCoV mutants in monocytes/macrophages. To detect most feline coronavirus field strains, the test was designed to amplify subgenomic mRNA of the highly conserved M gene. The test was applied to 1075 feline blood samples (424 from healthy, 651 from sick cats suspected of FIP) and returned 46% of the diseased cats as positive for feline coronavirus mRNA in their peripheral blood cells; of the healthy cats, 5% tested positive. Of a group of 81 animals in which FIP had been confirmed by post-mortem examination, 75 (93%) tested positive, whereas 17 cats with different pathologies (non-FIP cases) all tested negative. In view of the low rate of false-positive results (high specificity) the mRNA RT-PCR may be a valuable addition to the diagnostic arsenal for FIP.

48da594b6d9c7bc5f6de8496733e11b5b0c15bad	Of the eight clinically defined neuropathies associated with HIV infection, there is compelling evidence that acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDPN) have an autoimmune pathogenesis. Many non-HIV infected individuals who suffer from sensorymotor nerve dysfunction have autoimmune indicators. The immunopathogenesis of demyelination must involve neuritogenic components in myelin. The various antigens suspected to play a role in HIV-seronegative IDPN include (i) P 2 protein; (ii) sulfatide (GalS); (iii) various gangliosides (especially GM 1 ); (iv) galactocerebroside (GalC); and (v) glycoproteins or glycolipids with the carbohydrate epitope glucuronyl-3-sulfate. These glycoproteins or glycolipids may be individually targeted, or an immune attack may be raised against a combination of any of these epitopes. The glycolipids, however, especially GalS, have recently evoked much interest as mediators of immune events underlying both non-HIV and HIV-associated demyelinating neuropathies. The present review outlines the recent research findings of antiglycolipid antibodies present in HIVinfected patients with and without peripheral nerve dysfunction, in an attempt to arrive at some consensus as to whether these antibodies may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV-associated inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
569e969c4028e11b1ab830b17adab639ff7915fa	To determine the pathway adopted by peripherally inoculated Junin virus (JV) to reach the CNS, rat tissues were serially harvested to trace the sequence of viral progression from right hind footpad to brain. Immunoperoxidase (PAP) labeling of viral antigen, concomitantly with infectivity assays and histological examination of each selected sample, were carried out. As from the 2nd week post-infection (pi), neurological disease inducing 100% mortality at 1 month was evident. At day 5 pi, viral antigen was first detected at footpad level in epidermic and dermic cells, as well as in neighbouring myocytes; labeled macrophages infiltrating small nerve branches were also disclosed. As from 10-15 days pi, viral antigen became apparent along ipsilateral sciatic nerve structures and within lumbar spinal ganglion neurons, followed by a fast viral spread throughout CNS neurons that involved spinal cord and brain. Concurrent histopathology featured minimal inflammatory reaction together with generalized astrocytic activation. Hematogenous viral transport was negligible, since JV was isolated much earlier and in higher infectivity titers in neural tissues than in blood. It may be concluded that after viral replication in footpad, JV neural route was demonstrated by its PAP labeling from peripheral nerves to cerebral cortex. * Doctor E. F. Lascano passed away in June 1990.
156e47ce3b028a8895f15b7acb13ebfc17e7d680	Clinical management of COVID-19 is still complicated due to the lack of therapeutic interventions to reduce the breathing problems, respiratory complications and acute lung injury -which are the major complications of most of the mild to critically affected patients and the molecular mechanisms behind these clinical features are still largely unknown. In this study, we have used the RNA-seq gene expression pattern in the COVID-19 affected lung biopsy cells and compared it with the effects observed in typical cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We performed functional overrepresentation analyses using these differentially expressed genes to signify the processes/pathways which could be deregulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in the symptomatic impairments observed in COVID-19. Our results showed that the significantly altered processes include inflammatory responses, antiviral cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and interleukin signaling etc. along with downmodulated processes related to lung's functionality likeresponses to hypoxia, lung development, respiratory processes, cholesterol biosynthesis and surfactant metabolism. We also found that the viral protein interacting host's proteins involved in similar pathways like: respiratory failure, lung diseases, asthma, and hypoxia responses etc., suggesting viral proteins might be deregulating the processes related to acute lung injury/breathing complications in COVID-19 patients. Protein-protein interaction networks of these processes and map of gene expression of deregulated genes revealed that several viral proteins can directly or indirectly modulate the host genes/proteins of those lung related processes along with several host transcription factors and miRNAs. Surfactant proteins and their regulators SPD, SPC, TTF1 etc. which maintains the stability of the pulmonary tissue are found to be downregulated through viral NSP5, NSP12 that could lead to deficient gaseous exchange by the surface films. Mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the aberration of NDUFA10, NDUFAF5, SAMM50 etc. by NSP12; abnormal thrombosis in lungs through atypical PLAT, EGR1 functions by viral ORF8, NSP12; dulled hypoxia responses due to unusual shift in HIF-1 downstream signaling might be the causative elements behind the acute lung injury in COVID-19 patients. Our study put forward a distinct mechanism of probable virus induced lung damage apart from cytokine storm and advocate the need of further research for alternate therapy in this direction.
a3816ce68ae5fec1523c4a7f7613fee85fc39a31	The genus Torovirus (subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) 12 encompasses a range of species that infect domestic ungulates including cattle, 13 sheep, goats, pigs and horses, causing an acute self-limiting gastroenteritis. Using the 14 prototype species equine torovirus (EToV) we performed parallel RNA sequencing 15 (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to analyse the relative expression levels 16 of the known torovirus proteins and transcripts, chimaeric sequences produced via 17 discontinuous RNA synthesis (a characteristic of the nidovirus replication cycle) and 18 changes in host transcription and translation as a result of EToV infection. RNA 19 sequencing confirmed that EToV utilises a unique combination of discontinuous and 20 non-discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce its subgenomic RNAs; indeed, we 21 identified transcripts arising from both mechanisms that would result in sgRNAs 22 encoding the nucleocapsid. Our ribosome profiling analysis revealed that ribosomes 23 efficiently translate two novel CUG-initiated ORFs, located within the so-called 5' 24 UTR. We have termed the resulting proteins U1 and U2. Comparative genomic 25 analysis confirmed that these ORFs are conserved across all available torovirus 26 determine how equine torovirus produces subgenomic RNAs. In doing so, we also 38 identified two previously unknown open reading frames "hidden" within the 39 genome. Together these results highlight the similarities and differences between 40 this domestic animal virus and related pathogens of humans and livestock. 41 42
5c72f6d8e7596cfadf3802d7572e78274e8105e2	The commercial launch of 6G communications systems and United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) are both targeted for 2030. 6G communications is expected to boost global growth and productivity, create new business models and transform many aspects of society. The UN SDGs are a way of framing opportunities and challenges of a desirable future world and cover topics as broad as ending poverty, gender equality, climate change and smart cities. The relationship between these potentially mutually reinforcing forces is currently under-defined. Building on the vision for 6G, a review of megatrends, on-going activities on the relation of mobile communications to the UN SDGs and existing indicators, a novel linkage between 6G and the UN SDGs is proposed via indicators. The white paper has also launched the work of deriving new 6G related indicators to guide the research of 6G systems. The novel linkage is built on the envisaged three-fold role of 6G as 1) a provider of services to help steer and support communities and countries towards reaching the UN SDGs', 2) an enabler of measuring tool for data collection to help reporting of indicators with hyperlocal granularity, and 3) a reinforcer of new ecosystems based on 6G technology enablers and 6G network of networks to be developed in line with the UN SDGs that incorporates future mobile communication technologies available in 2030. Related challenges are also identified. An action plan is presented along with prioritized focus areas within the mobile communication sector technology and industry evolution to best support the achievement of the UN SDGs. This draft white paper has been written by an international expert group, led by the Finnish 6G Flagship program (6gflagship.com) at the University of Oulu, within a series of twelve 6G white papers to be published in their final format in June 2020.
a4d63f60e041a17162bf22ea443690db51830716	Formal mathematics is getting increasing attention in mathematics and computer science. In particular, the formalization of calculus has important applications in engineering design and analysis. In this paper, we present a formal proof of some fundamental theorems of continuous functions on closed intervals based on the Coq proof assistant. In this formalization, we build a real number system referring to Landau's Foundations of Analysis. Then we complete the formalization of the basic definitions of interval, function, and limit and formally prove the theorems including completeness theorem, intermediate value theorem, uniform continuity theorem and others in Coq. The proof process is normalized, rigorous and reliable.
4ae53029b955fc7de9832089eeb5fc51973623ec	The current treatments against SARS-CoV-2 have proved so far inadequate. A potent antiviral drug 30 is yet to be discovered. Lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein, secreted by exocrine glands and 31 neutrophils, possesses an antiviral activity extendable to SARS-Cov-2. 32 We performed a randomized, prospective, interventional study assessing the role of oral and intra-33 nasal lactoferrin to treat mild-to-moderate and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to prevent disease 34 evolution. Lactoferrin induced an early viral clearance and a fast clinical symptoms recovery in 35 addition to a statistically significant reduction of D-Dimer, Interleukin-6 and ferritin blood levels. 36 The antiviral activity of lactoferrin related to its binding to SARS-CoV-2 and cells and protein-37 protein docking methods, provided the direct recognition between lactoferrin and spike S, thus 38 hindering the spike S attachment to the human ACE2 receptor and consequently virus entering into 39 the cells. 40 Lactoferrin can be used as a safe and efficacious natural agent to prevent and treat infection. 42 43 44 48 possessing a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length 3 . Their genome encodes 16 non-structural proteins 4 , accessory proteins 5 and 4 essential structural 50 proteins, namely spike S glycoprotein, small envelope protein, matrix protein, and nucleocapsid 51 protein 6 . Homotrimeric S glycoprotein, possessing N-linked glycans, is located on the envelope and 52 comprises two subunits (S1 and S2) in each spike monomer 7 . As homotrimers of S glycoproteins 53 are exposed on the viral surface, they are responsible for binding to host receptors (S1) and 54 membrane fusion (S2) 1,8 . Cryo-electron microscopy on S protein has highlighted its interaction with 55 cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the dissociation of S1 after binding to 56 the host cells. This leads S2 to a more stable state, pivotal for membrane fusion 9-11 . Apart from 57 ACE2, also the heparan sulfate proteoglycans [HSPGs], localized on the cell surface, have been 58 recognized as the binding sites for SARS-CoV 12 and could be important also for SARS-CoV-2 in 59 the early attachment phase. Lately, Wrapp and coworkers 13 , determined the first 3.5 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy 61 [cryo-EM] structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in the prefusion conformation. Because of the 62 critical function of spike S glycoprotein in the SARS-CoV-2 infection process, the knowledge of 63 this structure, which represents a target for antibody, protein and drug mediated neutralization, 64 3 allowed to get atomic-level information able to guide the design and development of innovative 65 therapeutic molecules 14 . So far, the current treatment approaches have proved inadequate and a potent antiviral drug is yet to 67 be discovered. Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients remain a transmission reservoir, 68 with possible evolution to the most severe disease form, without a clear treatment indication. Innate 69 immunity should be better investigated to individuate a possible molecule with antiviral activity 70 against COVID-19, especially considering the fact that children, where innate immunity is more 71 prominent 15 , are less likely to suffer of severe and critical COVID-19 disease than adults 16,17 . 72 Considering all these aspects, lactoferrin (Lf), a multifunctional glycoprotein, belonging to the 73 transferrin family, secreted by exocrine glands and neutrophils and present in all human 74 secretion 18,19 , represents the ideal candidate to fight SARS-CoV-2 20 . Indeed, two promising in vitro studies, the first on SARS-CoV 12 and the second on SARS-CoV-2 21 76 have demonstrated that Lf is able to inhibit the early phase of these two viruses and is efficient 77 against SARS-CoV-2 also in post-infection phase 21 . The pleiotropic activity of Lf is mainly based on its four different functions: to chelate two ferric 79 iron per molecule, interact with anionic molecules, enter inside the nucleus and modulate iron 80 homeostasis. The ability to chelate two ferric ions per molecule is associated to the inhibition of 81 reactive oxygen species formation and the sequestration of iron, which is important for bacterial and 82 viral replication and is at the basis of the antibacterial and antiviral activity of Lf 19,22,23 . The binding 83 to the anionic surface compounds, thanks to its cationic feature, is associated to the host protection 84 against bacterial and viral adhesion and entry 19 . The entrance inside host cells and the translocation 85 into the nucleus 24,25 is related to the anti-inflammatory activity of Lf 26-28 and its ability to modulate 86 iron homeostasis perturbed by viral infection and inflammation 29 . As matter of fact, iron 87 homeostasis involves several iron proteins such as transferrin, ferroportin, hepcidin and ferritin the 88 disorders of which, induced by inflammation, lead to intracellular iron overload and viral 89 replication 20 . Moreover, Lf seems to regulate the activation of plasminogen and control coagulation 90 cascade with a remarkable antithrombotic activity 30 , a very frequent complication of SARS-CoV2 91 31 . In addition to all these abilities, Lf, as above reported, inhibits the early phase of SARS-CoV 12 92 and post-infection phase of SARS-CoV-2 12,21 probably through the binding to HSPGs or to viral 93 particles. 94 Therefore, based on this information, in order to evaluate the possibility of using Lf in the clinical 95 treatment of Covid-19, a clinical trial has been designed to validate the aforementioned assumptions 96 together with in vitro experimental assays and simulation. 97 4 In particular, we designed a prospective, interventional study in order to assess the role of oral and 98 intra-nasal liposomal Lf for COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate disease and COVID-19 99 asymptomatic patients, and document its efficacy in improving symptoms and clearing away the 100 virus. To study the mechanism of anti-viral activity of Lf against SARS-CoV-2, in vitro 101 experimental assays have been designed to validate the abovementioned postulations. The 102 hypothesis of the putative binding between spike and Lf and between viral units and host cells 103 HSPGs has been verified in vitro thus preliminarily demonstrating Lf antiviral activity against 104 SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer structure in prefusion conformation 13 has 105 been used to perform a protein-protein molecular docking analysis with the aim to confirm the 106 hypothesis of a direct interaction between the Spike S glycoprotein and the Lf protein. The structure 107 of the spike glycoprotein 13 has been completed using modelling techniques and used to predict Lf 108 interaction sites. Furthermore, the selected high-score protein-protein complex has been structurally 109 investigated using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and the free energy of interaction 110 between these proteins has been evaluated through the molecular mechanic energies combined with 111 generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation (MM/GBSA) method 32 . 112 113 RESULTS Demographic data 115 A total of 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at the real-time reverse transcription 116 polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were recruited in the COVID-19 patients' group to 117 participate in the study protocol. 22 patients had mild-to moderate symptoms and 10 patients were 118 asymptomatic. The mean age was 54.6 ± 16.9 years old. 14 patients were males and 18 females. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (28%) followed by cardiovascular diseases 120 (15.6%) and dementia (12.5%). 32 healthy volunteers (mean age 52.8 ± 15.5 years old.) with 121 negative rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV2 RNA were recruited in the control group to be paired to the 122 above COVID-19 group. Patients group and control group were homogeneous for age and 123 comorbidities. Clinic and demographic data of both groups are summarized in Tab.1. 124 Primary Endpoint 125 Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) revealed a negative 126 conversion of SARS-COV-2 RNA of the naso-oropharingeal swab in 10 patients (31.25%) at T1 127 and in all other patients at T2, with all patients showed a viral clearance at T2 (Fig.1) 128 Secondary Endpoints 129 5 At T0, 22 patients were symptomatic and 10 patients asymptomatic. The most frequent symptoms 130 were fatigue (50%), followed by arthralgia (37.5%) and cough (28%). At T1, 5 patients previously 131 symptomatic became asymptomatic, with a total of 17 asymptomatic and 15 symptomatic patients. At T2 other 6 patients, previously symptomatic at T1, became asymptomatic with a total of 23 133 asymptomatic patients and 9 symptomatic patients. In the latter group, the most frequent symptom 134 was fatigue (21.9%). Clinical symptoms are summarized in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (supplemental data). The comparison between COVID-19 group and control group parameters at T0 showed a 136 significant difference in platelet count (p-value < 0,0001), neutrophils count (p-value= 0,04), 137 monocytes count (p-value = 0,006), D-Dimer (< 0,0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p-138 value=0.008), ferritin (p-value < 0,0001), adrenomedullin (p-value< 0,0001) and IL-6 (p-value < 139 0,0001) (Tab. S1A, supplemental data). Regarding COVID-19 group blood parameters, IL-6 value showed a significant decrease between 141 T2 and T0 (Δ T2-T0 -2.52 ±1.46, p-value 0.05). Moreover, D-dimer showed a significant decrease 142 between T2 and T0 (Δ T2-T0 -392.56 ±142.71, p-value 0.01) and ferritin presented the same 143 significant trend (Δ T2-T0 -90.63 ±48.49, p-value 0.04) (Tab. S1B, supplemental data). Regarding the 144 other values we did not achieve a statistical significance, however we noticed an improvement in 145 the platelet count (T0: 239.63 ±83.05; T2: 243.70±65.5; Δ T2-T0 10.05±10.26) and a decrease of 146 alanine transaminase (ALT) (). Adrenomedullin remained at the same level all 148 over the analyzed period (Δ T2-T0 -0.01±0.03). IL-10 levels increased between T0 (8.67±3.26) and T2 149 (11.42±6.05), without showing statistical significance (Δ T2-T0 2.55±2.09). TNF-alfa decreased 150 between T2 (25.97±21.74) and T0 (37.34 ±19.95) without showing statistical significance (Δ T2-T0 -151 12.92±8.81). 152 Regarding safety assessment, 2 patients (6.2%) showed gastrointestinal complaints related to Lf 153 assumption at T2. The patients did not suspend Lf administration and the adverse event resolved 154 itself spontaneously. 155 Lactoferrin displays antiviral properties in in vitro models 156 Preliminary, the doses of 100 and 500 µg/ml of bovine Lf (bLf) in native form (7% iron saturated) 157 were assayed to detect their putative cytotoxicity by measuring cell morphology, proliferation and 158 viability of Vero E6 and Caco-2 cell monolayers after 72 h of incubation. Both 100 and 500 µg/ml 159 of bLf do not exert any cytotoxic effect (data not shown). 160 326 severe patients 56 . Regarding clinical symptoms recovery, we observed a reduction in all symptoms, with the 328 exception of fatigue, which persisted in 21.9 % of patients. We explained this result considering 329 patients age and concomitant comorbidities, which could create a bias to identify COVID-19 330 symptoms. Concerning Lf safety, we reported gastrointestinal complaints in 2 patients as occasional findings 332 that did not lead to treatment discontinuation. Therefore, we concluded that Lf is safe and well 333 tolerated among our study population. In our analysis, we used formulations containing bLf embedded in liposomes for nasal/oral 335 administration. Indeed, the bLf at 5% of iron saturation form is best suited to obtain the maximum 336 chelating effect. Nucleic digestion, in the nasal cavities, and proteases and lipases hydrolysis, at 337 gastric and intestinal level, inactivate the protein at its first entry, cancelling or extremely reducing 338 the activity. Lf is unstable in water and is particularly sensitive to bacterial and human proteases 339 (enzymes inactivating proteins). This results in protein denaturation, poor absorption and 340 inactivation. The inclusion of Lf in preserving structures, such as liposomes, reduces gastric and 341 intestinal denaturation while maintaining its integrity and therefore its biological functionality 57-59 . 342 The in vitro antiviral activity of bLf against enveloped and naked DNA and RNA viruses has been 343 widely demonstrated 12,22,23,60,61 , while few papers have been published on its in vivo efficacy against 344 viral infection 62-73 . 345 The ability of bLf to inhibit viral infection is generally attributed to its binding to cell surface 346 molecules and/or viral particles. BLf is able to competitively bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans 347 (HSPGs), present on the host cell surface and identified as initial sites for enveloped viruses 74,75 , 348 thus hindering the viral adhesion and internalization 12,76,77 . Moreover, bLf can also bind directly to 349 surface proteins of virus particles as HIV V3 loop of the gp120 78 and HCV E2 envelope proteins 79 . 350 The results, presented here, by monitoring the effect of bLf on different experimental procedures 351 indicate that the antiviral activity of bLf, pre-incubated with host cells, seems to vary according to 352 MOI, different cell lines and bLf concentration. As matter of fact, the pre-incubation of Vero E6 353 monolayers with 100 µg/ml of bLf, before SARS-CoV-2 infection at MOI 0.1 and 0.01, were 354 ineffective in inhibiting virus internalization (Figure 3), differently to that observed when 100 355 µg/ml of bLf were pre-incubated with Caco-2 cells and the infection was performed at MOI 0.01 356 ( Figure 4B ). This antiviral activity was observed until 48 hpi. Committee (Code 42/20). It was registered at www.clinicalTrials.gov (NCT04475120) and reported 423 according to CONSORT guidelines (Fig. S4, supplemental data) . 424 425 Study design 426 COVID-19 patients were consecutively enrolled from 22 April 2020 to 22 June 2020 from the 427 University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata, from Pineta Grande Hospital of Caserta and Villa dei 428 Pini Hospital Anzio (Rome). The scheduled dose treatment of liposomal bLf for oral use was 1gr 429 per day for 30 days (10 capsules per day) in addition to the same formulation intranasally 430 administered 3 times daily. 431 BLf capsules contain 100 mg of bLf encapsulated in liposome while bLf nasal spray contains about 432 2.5 mg/ml of bLf encapsulated in liposome. bLf, contained in both products, was checked by SDS-433 PAGE and silver nitrate staining and its purity was about 95%. The bLf iron saturation was about 434 5% as detected by optical spectroscopy at 468 nm based on an extinction coefficient of 0.54 (100% 435 iron saturation, 1% solution). The control group of healthy volunteers did not receive any treatment or placebo. 437 438 Endpoints measures 439 rRT-PCR was performed at T0, T1(after 15 days) and T2 (after 30 days) to detect SARS-CoV-2 440 RNA in the study population. 441 All participants (COVID-19 patients and control group) underwent the following laboratory tests: 442 complete blood count and chemistry panel (liver and kidney function), iron panel, coagulation 443 profile, IL-6, IL-10, TNF⍺, adrenomedullin serum levels. COVID-19 patients' blood samples were 444 collected at T0 and T2; control group's blood samples were collected at T0. 445 Body temperature and evaluation of related signs and symptoms were collected at T0, T1 and T2 in 446 COVID-19 patients. 447 448 In vitro antiviral activity of lactoferrin 449 For in vitro experiments, highly purified bLf was kindly provided by Armor Proteines Industries 450 (France). BLf was checked by SDS-PAGE and silver nitrate staining. Its purity was about 98% and 451 its concentration was confirmed by UV spectroscopy according to an extinction coefficient of 15.1 452 (280 nm, 1% solution). The bLf iron saturation was about 7% as detected by optical spectroscopy at 453 468 nm based on an extinction coefficient of 0.54 (100% iron saturation, 1% solution). LPS 454 contamination of bLf, estimated by Limulus Amebocyte assay (Pyrochrome kit, PBI International, 455 Italy), was equal to 0.6 ± 0.05 ng/mg of bLf. Before each in vitro assays, bLf solution was sterilized 456 15 by filtration using 0.2 µm Millex HV at low protein retention (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, 457 USA). 458 459 Cell culture and virus 460 The African green monkey kidney-derived Vero E6 and human colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 461 cells were provided by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in high-462 glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) supplemented 463 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) at 37°C in humidified incubators with 464 5% CO 2 . SARS-CoV-2 strain was isolated from nasopharyngeal specimen taken from a patient with 465 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and was propagated in Vero E6 cells. Viral titres were determined 466 by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays in Vero E6 (Spearman-Kärber method) by 467 microscopic scoring. All experiments were performed by infecting Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells with 468 SARS-CoV-2 strain at the Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, under 469 Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) protocols, in compliance with laboratory containment procedures 470 approved by the University of Padua. 471 Cytotoxicity assay 472 Cytotoxicity was evaluated by incubating 100 and 500 μg of bLf -the concentrations used for 473 invitro experiments -in DMEM containing 10% of FBS for 72 h at 37°C with Vero E6 and Caco-2 474 cells in 96-well microtiter plates. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed by MTT assay 475 (Merck, Italy). Tetrazolium salts used for quantifying viable cells were cleaved to form a formazan 476 dye, which was evaluated by spectrophotometric absorbance at 600 nm. 477 Infection assay 478 For infection assay, Vero E6 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 479 1x10 5 cells/well for 24h at 37°C in humidified incubators with 5% CO 2 , while Caco-2 cells were 480 seeded at a concentration of 2x10 5 cells/well for 48h at 37°C in humidified incubators with 5% 481 CO 2 . 100 μg of bLf for Vero E6 infection assay, while 100 and 500 μg of bLf were used for Caco-2 482 infection assay. In order to investigate the putative interaction of bLf with viral particles and/or host 483 cells, the following different experimental approaches were performed. To evaluate if bLf can 484 interfere with the viral infectivity rate by binding viral surface components, SARS-CoV-2 at 485 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and 0.01 was pre-incubated with bLf for 1h at 37°C in 486 humidified incubators with 5% CO 2 . The cells were then infected with these suspensions for 1h at 487 37°C in humidified incubators with 5% CO 2 . In order to evaluate if bLf interferes with the viral 488 16 attachment to host cells, the cells were pre-incubated in culture medium without FBS with bLf for 489 1h at 37°C in humidified incubators with 5% CO 2 . The cells were then washed with phosphate 490 buffered saline (PBS) and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 0.1 and 0.01 for 1h at 37°C in 491 humidified incubators with 5% CO 2 . To assess if bLf can interfere with both viral and host cell 492 components, bLf was added together with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 0.1 and 0.01 to cell monolayer 493 for 1h at 37°C in humidified incubators with 5% CO 2 . In addition, the pre-incubation of SARS-494 CoV-2 with bLf for 1h at 37°C was used to infect cell monolayer previously pre-treated with bLf 495 for 1 h at 37°C. Regarding Vero E6 cells, after each experimental approach, the cells were washed with PBS, 497 overlaid with DMEM containing 0.75% of carboxymethylcellulose and 2% of FBS and incubated 498 for 48h at 37°C in humidified incubators with 5% CO 2 . After 48h, the cells were washed, fixed with 499 5% of formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and stained with crystal violet at 1% for 5 min. The number of plaques was determined after extensive washing. 501 The other infection experiments were carried out with Caco-2 cells. Substantial cell death was not 502 detected up to 7 days on Caco-2 cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection at MOI 0.1 82 . In this respect, 503 after each experimental procedure, the cell monolayers were replaced with DMEM with 2% of FBS 504 and after 6, 24 and 48 hpi the supernatant samples were collected for RNA extraction and 505 quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of viral particles. Briefly, we lysed 506 200 μl of viral supernatant in an equal volume of NUCLISENS easyMAG lysis buffer (Biomerieux, 507 France). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed by an in-house real-time RT-PCR 508 method, which was developed according the protocol and the primers and probes designed by 509 Corman et al. 83 that targeted the genes encoding envelope (E) (E_Sarbeco_F, E_Sarbeco_R and 510 E_Sarbeco_P1) of SARS-CoV-2. Quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed in a final volume of 511 25 μl, containing 5 μl of purified nucleic acids, using One Step Real Time kit (Thermo Fisher 512 Scientific) and run on ABI 7900HT Fast Sequence Detection Systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cycle threshold (Ct) data from RT-PCR assays were collected for E genes. Genome equivalent 514 copies per ml were inferred according to linear regression performed on calibration standard curves. 515 Protein-protein docking methods The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in prefusion conformation was extracted from 517 a clustering procedure carried out as indicated in a previously published paper 14 . The three-518 dimensional structure of the diferric forms of bLf and hLf, refined at 2.8 Å and 2.2 resolution 519 respectively, were downloaded from the PDB Database (PDB IDs: 1BFL, 12 and 1B0L, 84 ). The 520 protein-protein docking analysis between the modelled SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein 1 and the Lf 521 structures was carried out using the Frodock docking algorithm 85 . Frodock's approach combines 522 572 573 Aknowledgements 574 We thank Prof. Denis Mariano for English language editing.
73bdfac22db4adeb5eb9fefef1eee2d5f24da0bc	In this article, we present a new distance metric, the Weighted Sequence Entropy (WSE), based on the short word composition of biological sequences. As a revision of the classical relative entropy (RE), our metric (1) works equivalently with RE in the case of small k, (2) avoids the degeneracy when some word types are absent in one sequence but not in the other. Experiments on 25 viruses including SARS-CoVs show that our method and RE give exactly the same phylogenetic tree when word length k 6 3. When k > 3, our method still works and gets convergent phylogenetic topology but the RE gives degenerate results.
c88ef6849c453ec01d136c41b639fb966525b08e	We introduce a 2-layer network model for the study of the immunization dynamics in epidemics. Spreading of an epidemic is modeled as an excitatory process in a small-world network (body layer) while immunization by prevention for the disease as a dynamic process in a scale-free network (head layer). It is shown that prevention indeed turns periodic rages of an epidemic into small fluctuation. The study also reveals that, in a certain situation, prevention actually plays an adverse role and helps the disease survive. We argue that the presence of two different characteristic time scales contributes to the immunization dynamics observed.

Background: Cardiovascular diseases(CVD) increase mortality risk from coronavirus infection , but there are concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both "direct", through infection, and "indirect", through changes in healthcare. We used population-based electronic health records from 3,862,012 individuals in England to estimate pre-and post-COVID-19 mortality risk("direct" effect) for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and (iii)estimated relative impact of COVID-19 on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). For "indirect" effects, we analysed weekly mortality and emergency department data for England/Wales and monthly hospital data from England(n=2), China(n=5) and Italy(n=1) for CVD referral, diagnosis and treatment until 1 May 2020. Findings: CVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy and England during the pandemic. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown, and is still reduced in Italy and England. Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous(peak RR 1.4). For total CVD(incident and prevalent), at 10% population COVID-19 rate, we estimated direct impact of 31,205 and 62,410 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 49932 to 99865 excess deaths. Interpretation: Supply and demand for CVD services have dramatically reduced across countries with potential for substantial, but avoidable, excess mortality during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
fc29089acf4b70c64a5a5e4ea64a318e8d52edbb	Enforced cell transdifferentiation of human cancer cells is a promising alternative to conventional chemotherapy. We previously identified albumin-associated lipid-and, more specifically, saturated fatty acid-induced transdifferentiation programs in human cancer cells (HCCLs). In this study, we further characterized the adipocyte-like cells, resulting from the transdifferentiation of human cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MALME-3M, and proposed a common mechanistic approach for these transdifferentiating programs. We showed the loss of pigmentation in MALME-3M cells treated with albumin-associated lipids, based on electron microscopic analysis, and the overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) by western blotting in MALME-3M and MCF-7 cells treated with unsaturated fatty acids. Comparing the gene expression profiles of naive melanoma MALME-3M cells and albumin-associated lipid-treated cells, based on RNA sequencing, we confirmed the transcriptional upregulation of some key adipogenic gene markers and also an alternative splicing of the adipogenic master regulator PPARG, that is probably related to the reported up regulated expression of the protein. Most importantly, these results also showed the upregulation of genes responsible for Clathrin (CLTC) and other adaptor-related proteins. An increase in CLTC expression in the transdifferentiated cells was confirmed by western blotting. Inactivation of CLTC by chlorpromazine (CHP), an inhibitor of CTLC mediated endocytosis (CME), and gene silencing by siRNAs, partially reversed the accumulation of neutral lipids observed in the transdifferentiated cells. These findings give a deeper insight into the phenotypic changes observed in HCCL to adipocyte-like transdifferentiation and point towards CME as a key pathway in distinct transdifferentiation programs.

c2f38e64fbda41863192d30dcab2e3e1c47f8eb7	Objectives: This review fills the paucity of information on K. pneumoniae as a nosocomial pathogen by providing pooled data on epidemiological risk factors, resistant trends and profiles and resistant and virulent genes of this organism in Asia. Exhaustive search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar for most studies addressing the prevalence, risk factors, drug resistant-mediated genes and/or virulent factors of K. pneumoniae in Asia. Data extracted for meta-analysis were analyzed using comprehensive meta-analysis version 3. Trends data for the isolation rate and resistance rates were entered into Excel spread sheet and the results were presented in graphs. : The prevalence rate of drug resistance in K. pneumoniae were; amikacin (40.8%) [95% CI 31.9-50.4], aztreonam (73.3%) [95% CI 59.9-83.4], ceftazidime (75.7%) [95% CI 65.4-83.6], ciprofloxacin (59.8%) [95% CI 48.6-70.1], colistin (2.9%) [95% CI 1.8-4.4], cefotaxime (79.2%) [95% CI 68.0-87.2], cefepime (72.6) [95% CI 57.7-83.8] and imipenem (65.6%) [95% CI 30.8-89.0]. TEM (39.5%) [95% CI 15.4-70.1], SHV-11 (41.8%) [95% CI 16.2-72.6] and KPC-2 (14.6%) [95% CI 6.0-31.4] were some of the resistance mediated genes observed in this study. The most virulent factors utilized by K. pneumoniae are; hypermucoviscous phenotype and mucoviscosity-related genes, genes for biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide, iron uptake and transport genes and finally, adhesive genes. It can be concluded that, antimicrobial resistant in K. pneumoniae is a clear and present danger in Asia which needs strong surveillance to curb this menace. It is very important for public healthcare departments to monitor and report changes in antimicrobial-resistant isolates.
8cb96ebaf1320867609839df21072f96631e9015	We report a human parechovirus-3 (HPeV-3) infection in 2 neonates who had prolonged fever (>5 days) with palmar-plantar erythema. This distinctive rash was observed 4-5 days after fever onset, just before defervescence. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels were characteristic laboratory findings in the 2 cases, suggesting tissue damage caused by hypercytokinemia. Case 1 was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, considering the possibility of severe systemic inflammatory responses. The initial ferritin level was 385 ng/mL (range, 0-400 ng/mL); however, the level increased to 2,581 ng/dL on day 5 after fever onset. Case 2 presented with milder clinical symptoms, and the patient recovered spontaneously. HPeV-3 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood samples, but no other causative agents were detected. The findings from our cases, in accordance with recent studies, suggest that clinical features such as palmarplantar erythema and/or hyperferritinemia might be indicators of HPeV-3 infection in neonates with sepsis-like illness. In clinical practice, where virology testing is not easily accessible, clinical features such as palmar-plantar erythema and/or hyperferritinemia might be helpful to diagnose HPeV-3 infection.
bcb0855b58b356b4e47c8349b5c0047d76a61bc0	Decentralized disaster governance has been gaining much attention with the rising global urbanization rate and the complex nature of the disasters occurring in densely urbanized areas today. This paper studies the case of South Korea, a highly urbanized country with relatively recent decentralization reforms, in order to analyze the evolution of its disaster management system and to draw out implications from its experience. Specifically, it traces the national-level institutional changes in its disaster management, and then closely examines a hydrofluoric gas leakage in the industrial city of Gumi. The finding is that South Korea simultaneously carried out both centralization and decentralization of disaster management, which are not contradictory but rather complementary. Nevertheless, while the country successfully set up an integrated and comprehensive national-level management system, from which disaster governance can successfully be decentralized to localities, it still requires much more developed and consolidated multilevel (vertical) and broader (horizontal) collaboration, which are the preconditions for decentralized disaster governance.
4294741f8af6ac5193d647a5b8da67d32750384c	Network representation learning aims to learn the low dimensional vector of the nodes in a network while maintaining the inherent properties of the original information. Existing algorithms focus on the single coarse-grained topology of nodes or text information alone, which cannot describe complex information networks. However, node structure and attribution are interdependent, indecomposable. Therefore, it is essential to learn the representation of node based on both the topological structure and node additional attributes. In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity complex network representation learning model (MNRL), which integrates topological structure and additional information at the same time, and presents these fused information learning into the same granularity semantic space that through fine-to-coarse to refine the complex network. Experiments show that our method can not only capture indecomposable multi-granularity information, but also retain various potential similarities of both topology and node attributes. It has achieved effective results in the downstream work of node classification and the link prediction on real-world datasets.
92ea1980ea8bd1105a53e6b8cc132d2448199864	Prediction of infection trends, estimating the efficacy of contact tracing, testing or impact of influx of infected are of vital importance for administration during an ongoing epidemic. Most effective methods currently are empirical in nature and their relation to parameters of interest to administrators are not evident. We thus propose a modified SEIRD model that is capable of modeling effect of interventions and in migrations on the progress of an epidemic. The tunable parameters of this model bear relevance to monitoring of an epidemic. This model was used to show that some of the commonly seen features of cumulative infections in real data can be explained by piece wise constant changes in interventions and population influx. We also show that the data of cumulative infections from twelve Indian states between mid March and mid April 2020 can be generated from the model by applying interventions according to a set of heuristic rules. Prediction for the next ten days based on this model, reproduced real data very well. In addition, our model also reproduced the time series of recoveries and deaths. Our work constitutes an important first step towards an effective dashboard for the monitoring of epidemic by the administration, especially in an Indian context.
a1e2a99eb903f9e37a119320d21c890e965f0222	Studies in which Drosophila melanogaster individuals carrying transgenes of animal viruses were used to analyze the action of animal viral proteins on the cell are reviewed. The data presented suggest that host specificity of viruses is determined by their proteins responsible for the penetration of the virus into the cell, while viral proteins responsible for interactions with the host cell are much less host specific. Due to this, the model of Drosophila with its developed system of searching for genetic interactions can be used to find intracellular targets for the action of viral proteins of the second group.

acc751e3f39515573231c168c3c530bfff91fee6	Background: Infectious bronchitis is highly contagious and constitutes one of the most common and difficult poultry diseases to control. IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. It exists as dozens of serotypes/genotypes. Only a few amino acid differences in the S1 protein of vaccine and challenge strains of IBV may result in poor protection. Tropism of IBV includes the respiratory tract tissues, proventriculus and caecal tonsils of the alimentary tract, the oviduct and the kidney. Results: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain closely related to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype was isolated from broiler chickens suffering from severe renal and respiratory distresses. The isolate was serologically identified by Dot-ELISA and further characterized by RT-PCR then genotyped using S1 gene sequence analysis. Alignment of the S1 sequence of the isolate with 16 IBV strains revealed high homology to isolates related to Mass serotype. Inoculation with the strain reproduced the disease in experimental 1-day-old chickens and resulted in 20% mortality, severe renal and moderate respiratory distresses. Marked histopathological changes in both kidney and trachea were observed in experimentally infected chickens. A protection study using the H120 live attenuated vaccine showed low protection rate in spite of high S1 sequence homology (97%). Protection based criteria were: virus re-isolation attempts from trachea, tracheal and renal histopathology as well as IBV antigens detection by immunofluorescent antibody technique in kidney sections. Conclusion: Periodical evaluation of cross-protective capabilities of IBV vaccine(s) versus recently recovered field isolates should be performed to ensure optimum control of IBV.

63aeb2ae0cf9c92c1d5b86516efc0bc748e805e7	Bats are natural reservoirs of the largest proportion of viral zoonoses among mammals, thus understanding the conditions for pathogen persistence in bats is essential to reduce human risk. Miniopterus schreibersii bat species in Catalonia. We find that persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis, and on survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The virus would not persist in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides for the first time epidemiological estimates for EBLV-1 progression in M. schreibersii. Our approach can be readily adapted to other zoonoses of public health concern where long-range migration and habitat sharing may play an important role.
4a288a498709b5f251eabba22c46d850b3d89556	Background: COVID-19 was a new emerging disease with high infectiousness. Its diagnosis primarily depended on real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. This study investigated epidemiological, clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 with negative RT-PCR results before confirmation. Methods: COVID-19 patients were enrolled and divided into two groups, negative group with negative RT-PCR results before confirmation and positive group with positive results at the first detection. Epidemiological and clinical features were compared. Dynamic chest CT images of negative group were evaluated. Result: Nighty-nine laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 including eight patients (8%) with negative RT-PCR results were included. Patients from negative group had similar epidemiological features as the average age (50.25±13.27 y in the negative group and 53.70±16.64 y in the positive group) and gender distribution (males made up 50% of the negative group and 62.6% of the positive group) were comparable. No significant difference of clinical symptoms were observed between the two groups. It was found that fever was the most common symptom for both groups, followed by cough, expectoration, chest distress, fatigue and gastroenterological symptoms. Moreover, ground-glass opacities and consolidations were main manifestations in chest CT of COVID-19 patients with or without confirmed RT-PCR results. Conclusions: Regardless of initial RT-PCR results, COVID-19 patients had similar epidemiological, clinical and chest CT features. Our study suggested values of early A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t chest CT scan in COVID-19 screening and dynamic significance of radiology in disease monitoring to guide clinical decision.

e44870f75892595841566f6b64dadffdc731f615	The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409e7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128e1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588e13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th e 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.
389b8e63e9d1c85ecfe5c35ec441f5dd0546fe88	To help clarify effector mechanisms in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the cytotoxic effects of myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive lymphocytes on oligodendrocytes were studied using a 51Cr release assay. MBP-reactive encephalitogenic T cell lines were cytotoxic to 51Cr-labeled oligodendrocyte target cells derived from Lewis rat fetal brain-dissociated culture, when incubated for 6 h in the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and MBP (percent 51Cr release = 65 + 3% vs. spontaneous release = 22 + 3% vs. normal lymph node cells + APC and MBP = 20 + 3%). This reaction is time dependent, likely MHC restricted, and is not just a nonspecific toxic effect against any Lewis target cells since neither fibroblasts nor astrocytes were affected. Other (tetanus toxoid-reactive) lymphoblasts stimulated by specific antigen were not cytotoxic to the oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that oligodendrocytes might be target cells for MBP-reactive lymphocytes in EAE if antigen presentation is appropriate.

While most cells require ECM adhesion to survive, it is now clear that differentiated function is intimately dependent upon cellular interaction with the ECM. Therefore, it is not surprising that the ECM is increasingly found to be involved in the enigmatic process of neurodegeneration. Descriptive studies of human neurodegenerative disorders and experimental studies of animal models of neurodegeneration have begun to define potential mechanisms of ECM disruption that can lead to synaptic and neuronal loss.
3407ec3e0f4bd479cea93cdf1270e2fabcbad190	Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause ocular and sexually transmitted diseases, and are associated with cardiovascular diseases. The analysis of codon usage may improve our understanding of the evolution and pathogenesis of Chlamydia and allow reengineering of target genes to improve their expression for gene therapy. Here, we analyzed the codon usage of C. muridarum, C. trachomatis (here indicating biovar trachoma and LGV), C. pneumoniae, and C. psittaci using the codon usage database and the CUSP (Create a codon usage table) program of EMBOSS (The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite). The results show that the four genomes have similar codon usage patterns, with a strong bias towards the codons with A and T at the third codon position. Compared with Homo sapiens, the four chlamydial species show discordant seven or eight preferred codons. The ENC (effective number of codons used in a gene)-plot reveals that the genetic heterogeneity in Chlamydia is constrained by the G+C content, while translational selection and gene length exert relatively weaker influences. Moreover, mutational pressure appears to be the major determinant of the codon usage variation among the chlamydial genes. In addition, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of E. coli, yeast, adenovirus and Homo sapiens. There are 23 codons showing distinct usage differences between C. trachomatis and E. coli, 24 between C. trachomatis and adenovirus, 21 between C. trachomatis and Homo sapiens, but only six codons between C. trachomatis and yeast. Therefore, the yeast system may be more suitable for the expression of chlamydial genes. Finally, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of six eukaryotes, eight prokaryotes and 23 viruses. There is a strong positive correlation between the differences in coding GC content and the variations in codon bias (r=0.905, P<0.001). We conclude that the variation of codon bias between C. trachomatis and other organisms is much less influenced by phylogenetic lineage and primarily determined by the extent of disparities in GC content.
703f86c62ceb141bb69656ce5d3ae330d0969976	The adenosine nucleoside analog BCX4430 is a direct-acting antiviral drug under investigation for the treatment of serious and life-threatening infections from highly pathogenic viruses, such as the Ebola virus. Cellular kinases phosphorylate BCX4430 to a triphosphate that mimics ATP; viral RNA polymerases incorporate the drug's monophosphate nucleotide into the growing RNA chain, causing premature chain termination. BCX4430 is active in vitro against many RNA viral pathogens, including the filoviruses and emerging infectious agents such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In vivo, BCX4430 is active after intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and oral administration in a variety of experimental infections. In nonclinical studies involving lethal infections with Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Yellow Fever virus, BCX4430 has demonstrated pronounced efficacy. In experiments conducted in several models, both a reduction in the viral load and an improvement in survival were found to be related to the dose of BCX4430. A Phase 1 clinical trial of intramuscular administration of BCX4430 in healthy subjects is currently ongoing.

ee986ee9617cddea4f905898fc76512afd10ae1f	Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019.
53cd9698ad7329f14d726359cae63a6d1f5b1996	The history, current situation and control measures for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) variants are reviewed. A large number of IBV variants exist worldwide; some being unique to a particular area, others having a more general distribution. The possible reasons why some strains spread readily over major parts of the world, whereas other strains stay more localized are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of strain classification by protectotyping, serotyping and genotyping are discussed in relation to in vivo protection. The different vaccination strategies are also considered.
15fca31a1b67c6a86329fc992fc68c09959d1863	Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical departments were forced to reschedule their activity giving priority to urgent procedures and non-deferrable oncological cases. There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department. Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature. A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed. Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not. Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure. There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches. Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission. Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri-and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from nonessential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.
24fa23f780c8e052e2cbbd8c99e54793b6723c2f	Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 ABSTRACT: Intestinal dysfunction, which may cause a series of metabolic diseases, has become a worldwide health problem. In the past few years, studies have shown that consumption of poultry eggs has the potential to prevent a variety of metabolic diseases, and increasing attention has been directed to the bioactive proteins and their peptides in poultry eggs. This review mainly focused on the biological activities of an important egg-derived protein named ovomucin. Ovomucin and its derivatives have good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunity-regulating and other biological functions. These activities may affect the physical, biological and immune barriers associated with intestinal health. This paper reviewed the structure and the structure-activity relationship of ovomucin，the potential role of ovomucin and its derivatives in modulation of intestinal health are also summarized. Finally, the potential applications of ovomucin and its peptides as functional food components to prevent and assist in the pretreatment of intestinal health problems are prospected. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The problem of intestinal health has become one of the most important causes of human death. The deterioration of intestinal barrier function and intestinal permeability disorders may increase the absorption of intestinal lumen antigens, promote the translocation of harmful substances and pathogens into the bloodstream, and cause ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and other diseases. Besides, intestinal disorders are early events of metabolic diseases (including cardiovascular diseases and cancer) [1], almost all chronic metabolic diseases are closely related to intestinal and/or intestinal microbiota [2, 3]. Therefore, the intestine is an important target for early treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal inflammation and metabolic diseases. The integrity and function of intestinal structure are very important to intestinal health, and the imbalance dietary structure is a high risk factor for intestinal mucus damage. The intestinal mucus layer is a dynamic barrier that can be continuously replenished by goblet cell secretion, but if the bacteria degrade mucus faster than the cell secretion supplement, the integrity of this critical barrier will be compromised, giving opportunities for intestinal bacteria to contact the inner mucosa layer [4]. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) recognize intestinal bacteria as pathogens and stimulate the production of excess reactive oxygen species and free radicals. At the same time, they also produce a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 activate immune responses, leading to intestinal inflammation damage [5, 6]. Food ingredients or environmental changes can induce imbalances in microbiota and mucus degrade, thereby promoting the infection of pathogens and harmful substances, and further inducing chronic inflammation and metabolic diseases [7-9]. For example, the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can be released from the dietary residues using the digestive enzymes of the intestinal microbiota. By regulating immune and gene expression, the SCFAs maintain the integrity of the mucus barrier and inhibit inflammation. At the same time, protein residues and fat-stimulated bile acids may also be metabolized by microbiota into inflammation and / or carcinogenic metabolites [9]. The above processes can be summarized in Figure 1. Therefore, potential intervention strategies to combat intestinal damage should include maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucus layer, reducing the abundance or viability of mucus-degrading bacteria (regulating the microbiota balance), inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory factors in the intestinal mucosa secretion, or a combination of the three above. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 14]. Egg-derived proteins, including egg transferrin, lysozyme, and phosphoprotein are showing excellent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory [15] and Journal Pre-proof Previous interest in this protein aimed to understand its role in egg white thinning, and it has been found that ovomucin is the main reason for maintaining the gel properties and foam stability of egg white [32]. Recently, a variety of biological activities of ovomucin have been reported. For example, ovomucin derivatives have superior antitumor activities through inhibiting the formation of tumor blood vessel [33]. It has potential to inhibit the growth and reproduction of some microorganisms, Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7 preventing cells from being adhered by influenza viruses [22] . However, as a novel functional food ingredient, ovomucin has not been fully studied and utilized, probably due to its complex molecular architecture and little direct evidence for the structure-activity relationship. Ovomucin is a glycoprotein with high molecular weight. The linear molecule of ovomucin forms a randomly curled structure at the end, which is considered to have the same highly polymerized macromolecular structure as mammalian mucin. The structural model of ovomucin is depicted in Figure 2 . Briefly, ovomucin is composed of a carbohydrate-rich β-subunit (Molecular weight is about 400kDa) and a carbohydrate-poor α-subunit with approximately 60% and 15% carbohydrates, respectively [34] . Carbohydrates presenting in ovomucin mainly are mannose, galactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid and fructose, and sulfated saccharides [35] . These carbohydrate groups bind to long-chain molecule in the form of N-glycosylated and O-glycosylated at specific amino acid sites, and it has been confirmed that these carbohydrate groups act as an important part to resist microorganism invasion [36] . The electrophoretic study of α-ovomucin is further divided into α 1 -ovomucin and α 2 -ovomucin, relative molecular weight is about 150 kDa and 220 kDa, respectively. These three subunits are polymerized into ovomucin macromolecule by disulfide bond [34], and the corresponding three peaks could be eluted by gel filtration [37]. In particular, the ɑ-subunit mainly contains acidic amino acids such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid; Journal Pre-proof 2 Bioactivities of ovomucin and its peptides Serial studies have shown that ovomucin and its peptides possess good anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities in vitro [28-30]. They can participate in and mediate the regulation of various cell functions, stimulate the proliferation of macrophages and lymphocytes [31], promote the synthesis of cytokines such as interleukin, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon, thereby affecting the immune system and inhibit tumorigenesis [25, 26, 33]. Furthermore, ovomucin can also reduce Journal Pre-proof decrease of binding force to NDV in heated samples depends on the destruction of NeuAc residues in ovomucin [19]. Many studies have reported the anti-infective activity of sialic acid against bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, and Helicobacter pylori [45, 49], and ovomucin also showed similar characteristics. Kobayashi, et al. [50] proved that the Journal Pre-proof 2.1.2 Antitumor activity Ohami [53] observed the cytotoxic effects of β-ovomucin on SEKI (human melanoma) and 3LL (Lewis lung cancer cells) through scanning electron microscopy, and the dose and time effects of toxicological to sarcoma-180 (SR-180) cells were further studied [25, 26]. The β-subunit-treated tumor cells have a reduced number of microvilli in the cell membrane, vesicle formation, irregular chromatin accumulation, irregular nuclear shapes, swollen cytoplasmic organs, accompanied by degradation Journal Pre-proof receptors to prevent the binding of K88 (Ac) strain to porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) [60]. Four high affinity fractions were identified from α-ovomucin hydrolysate, which significantly increased (about 90%) adhesion of strain ECL 13998 to IPEC-J2 cells.
023b805a96c852619186f55af4bbbdd5f9fa8156	In 2013, the outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in Taiwan caused serious economic losses. In this study, we examined whether the variations of the cis-acting elements between the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Taiwan (TW) strain and the prototype strain CV777 alter gene expression. For this aim, we analyzed the variations of the cis-acting elements in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) between the PEDV TW, CV777, and other reference strains. We also determined the previously unidentified transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), a sequence motif required for coronavirus transcription, and found that a nucleotide deletion in the TW strain, in comparison with CV777 strain, immediately downstream of the leader core sequence alters the identity between the leader TRS and the body TRS. Functional analyses using coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA revealed that such variations in cis-acting elements for the TW strain compared with the CV777 strain have an influence on the efficiency of gene expression. The current data show for the first time the evolution of PEDV in terms of cis-acting elements and their effects on gene expression, and thus may contribute to our understanding of recent PED outbreaks worldwide. Genes 2018, 9, 591 2 of 16 upstream of each ORF in the 3 -proximal genome region [5] . An upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in the 5 UTR of coronaviruses has been shown to be important for virus fitness [6] . Analyses of Alphacoronavirus 5 UTRs have revealed four conserved RNA secondary structures, including stem-loops (SLs) 1, 2, 4, and 5, which are also conserved for Betacoronavirus [4, 7] . Moreover, studies in Betacoronavirus have determined a requirement of these 5 secondary structures for coronaviral RNA synthesis [8] . RNA structures and their functions in coronaviral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis have also been identified in Betacoronavirus 3 UTRs, including the 5 -most bulged stem-loop (BSL) [9,10], hair-pin pseudoknot (PK) [11] , and 3 -most hypervariable region (HVR) [12] . However, structural analyses by Madhugiri et al. have suggested the absence of a BSL equivalent in Alphacoronavirus [4]. Both Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus contain the conserved octanucleotide sequence 5 -GGAAGAGC-3 within the HVR [4]. Synthesis of sgmRNA in coronaviruses requires a conserved TRS sequence motif, which is located at the 3 end of the leader sequence (TRS-L) and precedes each 3 proximal gene (TRS-B) . The TRS contains a conserved sequence (CS) flanked by variable sequences at its 5 (5 TRS) and 3 (3 TRS) ends [5, 13] . During negative-strand sgmRNA synthesis, coronaviral polymerase along with negative-strand sgmRNA attenuates at the TRS-B, switches the template to the TRS-L, as guided by basepairing between the TRS-B and TRS-L, and then resumes to complete synthesis by copying the leader sequence [14, 15] . In comparison with the 5 TRS, the 3 TRS has a more decisive influence on sgmRNA synthesis [16, 17] . It has been proposed that a one-nucleotide (nt) (A) deletion immediately downstream of the CS-L may influence PEDV sgmRNA synthesis [3, 18, 19] , though an in-depth examination to support this hypothesis has not been conducted. The PEDV prototype strain CV777 was first identified in 1978, and suckling piglets infected with this strain exhibited only mild diarrhea [20] [21] [22] . In 2013, the sudden appearance of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) with more severe diarrhea in the USA and a subsequent reoccurrence in Asian countries including Taiwan caused serious economic losses [3, 23, 24] . PED has since been one of the most devastating swine diseases worldwide. With such outbreaks, a crucial question is whether the pathogenicity of PEDV has been altered, leading to serious disease outbreaks. Because the coronavirus spike (S) protein interacts with a cellular receptor during virus entry [25, 26] and functions by inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host [27] [28] [29] , many studies have focused on a sequence comparison of the S protein between emergent or re-emergent PEDV strains and the prototype strain CV777 to seek a possible answer for PED outbreaks [18, 24, 30, 31] . In addition to S protein, whether other factors play roles in the outbreak remain to be elucidated. The evolution of cis-acting elements in PEDV has not been previously analyzed. In this study, we determined whether the cis-acting elements that are required for gene expression are altered in the PEDV Taiwan (TW) strain in comparison with those of the PEDV prototype strain CV777. Functional analyses were also performed to determine whether the identified variations in cis-acting elements between the two strains alter the efficiency of translation, replication (genomic RNA synthesis), and transcription (sgmRNA synthesis) of the virus. The results may extend our understanding for the recent PED outbreaks in Taiwan and other countries. Materials and Methods Fecal and intestinal samples were collected from the Animal Disease
6965c397de2fdd929fcfae773e1fb5ad90e65cf7	Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), involves multiple organs. Testicular involvement is largely unknown. Objective: To determine the pathological changes and whether SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the testes of deceased COVID-19 patients. Design, setting, and participants: Postmortem examination of the testes from 12 COVID-19 patients was performed using light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry for lymphocytic and histiocytic markers. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the virus in testicular tissue. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Seminiferous tubular injury was assessed as none, mild, moderate, or severe according to the extent of tubular damage. Leydig cells in the interstitium were counted in ten 400 microscopy fields. Results and limitations: Microscopically, Sertoli cells showed swelling, vacuolation and cytoplasmic rarefaction, detachment from tubular basement membranes, and loss and sloughing into lumens of the intratubular cell mass. Two, five, and four of 11 cases showed mild, moderate, and severe injury, respectively. The mean number of Leydig cells in COVID-19 testes was significantly lower than in the control group (2.2 vs 7.8, p < 0.001). In the interstitium there was edema and mild inflammatory infiltrates composed of T lymphocytes and histiocytes. Transmission EM did not identify viral particles in three cases. RT-PCR detected the virus in one of 12 cases. Conclusions: Testes from COVID-19 patients exhibited significant seminiferous tubular injury, reduced Leydig cells, and mild lymphocytic inflammation. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the testes in the majority (90%) of the cases by RT-PCR, and in none J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f by electron microscopy. These findings can provide evidence-based guidance for sperm donation and inform management strategies to mitigate the risk of testicular injury during the COVID-19 disease course. Patient summary: We examined the testes of deceased COVID-19 patients. We found significant damage to the testicular parenchyma. However, virus was not detected in testes in the majority of cases. The sponsors played a role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript.

878c083d8dba57f1ac98843585ab42fe5efd2980	Dendritic cells (DC) are critical to an integrated immune response and serve as the key link between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Under steady state conditions, brain DC's act as sentinels, continually sampling their local environment. They share this function with macrophages derived from the same basic hemopoietic (bone marrow-derived) precursor and with parenchymal microglia that arise from a unique non-hemopoietic origin. While multiple cells may serve as antigen presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells present both foreign and self-proteins to naïve T cells that, in turn, carry out effector functions that serve to protect or destroy. The resulting activation of the adaptive response is a critical step to resolution of injury or infection and is key to survival. In this review we will explore the critical roles that DCs play in the brain's response to neuroinflammatory disease with emphasis on how the brain's microenvironment impacts these actions.
be459dd25c7c6092a050c722c69ddd3d34ce0f94	Background: Infectious bronchitis is a severe disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) that affects fowl flocks worldwide. The understanding of the mechanisms involved in IBV evolution and variation would provide important theoretical basis for prevention and control of the disease in the future. Methods: IBV strain GD was isolated from southern China in 2013 and the complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed. Results: The genome of approximately 27,680 nt comprised six genes, with insertions and mutations in most of the structural genes. The S1 gene showed the highest identity to strain TW2575/98 isolated in Taiwan, and was distantly related to the H120 vaccine strain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the S1 gene of strain GD was also related to that of TW-type strains. Recombination analysis indicated that strain GD was a chimera whose putative parental strains belonged to the QX-and TW-type subgroups. Conclusions: An increasing number of TW-type strains have been isolated from China in recent years, which is in agreement with our findings, suggesting the emergence and increased prevalence of new TW-type strains in southern China.
f76f29653d5c53667e4a9615ca50f8b94c753d36	Coronaviruses are of veterinary and medical importance and include highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. They are known to efficiently evade early innate immune responses, manifesting in almost negligible expression of type-I interferons (IFN-I). This evasion strategy suggests an evolutionary conserved viral function that has evolved to prevent RNA-based sensing of infection in vertebrate hosts. Here we show that the coronavirus endonuclease (EndoU) activity is key to prevent early induction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) host cell responses. Replication of EndoU-deficient coronaviruses is greatly attenuated in vivo and severely restricted in primary cells even during the early phase of the infection. In macrophages we found immediate induction of IFN-I expression and RNase L-mediated breakdown of ribosomal RNA. Accordingly, EndoU-deficient viruses can retain replication only in cells that are deficient in IFN-I expression or sensing, and in cells lacking both RNase L and PKR. Collectively our results demonstrate that the coronavirus EndoU efficiently prevents simultaneous activation of host cell dsRNA sensors, such as Mda5, OAS and PKR. The localization of the EndoU activity at the site of viral RNA PLOS Pathogens | (to SRW), and R01-CA044059 (to RHS). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. synthesis-within the replicase complex-suggests that coronaviruses have evolved a viral RNA decay pathway to evade early innate and intrinsic antiviral host cell responses. Coronaviruses are long known to be particularly successful in evading host innate immune responses. This manifests in barely detectable interferon responses during the first hours of infection and greatly facilitates establishment of robust virus replication. This phenotype of early innate immune evasion is common to all coronaviruses and can have detrimental consequences particular for infections with highly pathogenic coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We therefore hypothesized that there must be an evolutionary conserved viral function that has evolved to prevent sensing of coronavirus infection by infected host cells. Our study now describes this function, namely the highly conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease activity. We found that coronaviruses that lack this enzymatic activity are readily visible to infected host cells that can now mount a swift and potent host response restricting virus replication within hours. Our study provides a new paradigm of a first layer of RNA virus innate immune evasion during the early phase of infection, that takes place at the site of RNA synthesis, and is based on removal of dsRNA that would otherwise trigger the simultaneous activation of cytoplasmic host cell sensors.

d6671f8616cdb19a4976b3b2e9247e3a91590401	Based on genome-scale loss-of-function screens we discovered that Topoisomerase III-ß (TOP3B), a human topoisomerase that acts on DNA and RNA, is required for yellow fever virus and dengue virus-2 replication. Remarkably, we found that TOP3B is required for efficient replication of all positive-sense-single stranded RNA viruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2. While there are no drugs that specifically inhibit this topoisomerase, we posit that TOP3B is an attractive anti-viral target.
443f229e4a572a1ff031d1ca5024d0b828a8cc1a	The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronoavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 illness, has caused over 2 million infections worldwide in four months. In SARS coronaviruses, the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) methylates the 5'-end of virally encoded mRNAs to mimic cellular mRNAs, thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction. We report here the high-resolution structure of a ternary complex of full-length nsp16 and nsp10 of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of cognate RNA substrate and a methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine. The nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer was captured in the act of 2'-O methylation of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We reveal large conformational 32 changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary state. This structure provides new mechanistic insights into the 2'-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap. We also discovered a distantly located ligand-binding site unique to SARS-CoV-2 that may serve as an alternative target site for antiviral development. 36 of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded β-coronavirus with a large, complex RNA genome 2 . To hijack the host translation machinery for propagation, enzymes encoded by the genome of coronaviruses (CoVs) modify the 5'-end of virally encoded mRNAs by creating a cap 3 . 44 RNA capping in CoVs involves activities of several nonstructural proteins (nsps): nsp13, a bifunctional RNA/NTP triphosphatase (TPase) and helicase; nsp14, a bifunctional 3'à5' mismatch exonuclease and mRNA cap guanine-N7 methyltransferase; nsp16, a ribose 2'-O methyltransferase; and an elusive guanylyl transferase 4-7 . Nsp16 forms an obligatory complex with nsp10 to efficiently convert client mRNA species from the Cap-0 ( me7 GopppA1) to the Cap-1 form ( me7 GopppA1m), by methylating the ribose 2'-O of the first nucleotide (usually adenosine in CoVs) of the nascent mRNA using SAM (S-adenosyl 52 methionine) as the methyl donor 4, 8 . This Cap-1 form serves to avoid induction of the innate immune response 9-11 . Hence, ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to CoV infection and limit pathogenesis 9, 10 . It has been shown that live vaccination with nsp16defective SARS-CoV-1 or an immunogenic disruption of the nsp16-nsp10 interface protects mice 56 from an otherwise lethal challenge 12, 13 , making nsp16/nsp10 an attractive drug target. Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-1 nsp16/nsp10 in complex with SAM/SAH or sinefungin, but without an RNA substrate, have been reported 4, 8, 14 , so that key information about the catalytic 60 mechanism of mRNA capping in CoVs, and SARS-CoV-2 in particular, is still missing. To understand the determinants of RNA cap modification and help guide the development of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapies, we have now succeeded in solving the high-resolution structure (to 1.8
87f70527afcdab4b28790be00d63e2102c2747d8	Despite widespread influenza vaccination programs, influenza remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Age-related changes in multiple aspects of the adaptive immune response to influenza have been well-documented including a decline in antibody responses to influenza vaccination and changes in the cellmediated response associated with immune senescence. This review will focus on T cell responses to influenza and influenza vaccination in older adults, and how increasing frailty or coexistence of multiple (≥2) chronic conditions contributes to the loss of vaccine effectiveness for the prevention of hospitalization. Further, dysregulation of the production of pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators contributes to a decline in the generation of an effective CD8 T cell response needed to clear influenza virus from the lungs. Current influenza vaccines provide only a weak stimulus to this arm of the adaptive immune response and rely on re-stimulation of CD8 T cell memory related to prior exposure to influenza virus. Efforts to improve vaccine effectiveness in older adults will be fruitless until CD8 responses take center stage.
1ed8bb1411cc073917455790fa60f92facb10ff6	The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear compartment involved in ribosome subunit biogenesis, regulation of cell stress and modulation of cellular growth and the cell cycle, among other functions. The nucleolus is composed of complex protein/protein and protein/RNA interactions. It is a target of virus infection with many viral proteins being shown to localize to the nucleolus during infection. Perturbations to the structure of the nucleolus and its proteome have been predicted to play a role in both cellular and infectious disease. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS with bioinformatic analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to investigate whether the nucleolar proteome altered in virus-infected cells. In this study, the avian nucleolar proteome was defined in the absence and presence of virus, in this case the positive strand RNA virus, avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Data sets, potential protein changes and the functional consequences of virus infection were validated using independent assays. These demonstrated that specific rather than generic changes occurred in the nucleolar proteome in infectious bronchitis virus-infected cells.

b1d1e0ce5c0c0da0c4bb0da1b4c042e9e7cd1b1f	In 1985, Restivo and Salemi presented a list of five problems concerning power free languages. Problem 4 states: Given α-power-free words u and v, decide whether there is a transition from u to v. Problem 5 states: Given α-power-free words u and v, find a transition word w, if it exists. Let Σ k denote an alphabet with k letters. Let L k,α denote the α-power free language over the alphabet Σ k , where α is a rational number or a rational "number with +". If α is a "number with +" then suppose k ≥ 3 and α ≥ 2. If α is "only" a number then suppose k = 3 and α > 2 or k > 3 and α ≥ 2. We show that: If u ∈ L k,α is a right extendable word in L k,α and v ∈ L k,α is a left extendable word in L k,α then there is a (transition) word w such that uwv ∈ L k,α . We also show a construction of the word w.

d8b3e15a543a14c8412496a26fea778c0fa8cd9a	Il binomio globalizzazione/salute salta usualmente alla ribalta di fronte alle emergenze sanitarie come la SARS 1 , o più recentemente l'influenza aviaria, che godono fin troppo spesso dell'onore delle cronache. Considerata la velocità con cui si possono diffondere nuovi germi patogeni, giustamente è cresciuta la preoccupazione per il rischio di pandemie. Tuttavia, possiamo sentirci rassicurati, almeno in parte, dal fatto che la globalizzazione si porta dietro anche un'elevata capacità di rispondere alle emergenze su scala planetaria, com'è successo per il controllo della diffusione della SARS e si spera che succeda nel caso dell'influenza aviaria. Il rapporto tra globalizzazione e salute può essere guardato in una prospettiva più ampia, diversa da quella delle emergenze sanitarie, tenendo presente che la globalizzazione agisce contestualmente su diversi fattori determinanti per la salute generale, e non si tratta solo di fattori economici, ma anche politico-istituzionali, socioculturali e ambientali [1]. Basti pensare a quanto l'instabilità politica e lo stato di conflitto possano pesare sulle possibilità di sviluppo economico e sociale di un Paese e, direttamente o indirettamente, sullo stato di salute della popolazione.

This study aimed to analyze the project types and the geographical distribution of the PGYD training institutions in Taiwan from 2010 to 2018. Materials and methods: From 2010 to 2018, 735 hospitals and clinics participated in four types of PGYD project including hospital as the single training institution (project A), clinic as the single training institution (project B), hospital as the main training institution in the joint training group (project C), and clinic as the main training institution in the joint training group (project D). The project types and the geographical distribution of the training institutions were analyzed.
b01be64ab1df7d3380ea2265741fc2a3ea76e496	The Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) outbreak spread rapidly in Italy and the lack of intensive care unit(ICU) beds soon became evident, forcing the application of noninvasive respiratory support(NRS) outside the ICU, raising concerns over staff contamination. We aimed to analyze the safety of the hospital staff, the feasibility, and outcomes of NRS applied to patients outside the ICU. In this observational study, data from 670 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 referred to the Pulmonology Units in nine hospitals between March 1 st and May 10 th ,2020 were analyzed. Data were collected including medication, mode and usage of the NRS (i.e. high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation(NIV)), length of stay in hospital, endotracheal intubation(ETI) and deaths. Results: Forty-two health-care workers (11.4%) tested positive for infection, but only three of them required hospitalization. Data are reported for all patients (69.3% male), whose mean age was 68 (SD 13) years. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at baseline was 152+79, and the majority of patients (49.3%) were treated with CPAP. The overall unadjusted 30-day mortality rate was 26.9% with 16%, 30%, and 30%, while the total ETI rate was 27% with 29%, 25% and 28%, for HFNC, CPAP, and NIV, respectively, and the relative probability to die was not related to the NRS used after adjustment for confounders. ETI and length of stay were not different among the groups. Mortality rate increased with age and comorbidity class progression. The application of NRS outside the ICU is feasible and associated with favourable outcomes. Nonetheless, it was associated with a risk of staff contamination.

c25c7c5d5c05d8ef0d66da0b2ddc4335c4884566	The non-specific effects of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination have been enthusiastically discussed. 1 Miller et al. reported the relationship between BCG vaccination and mortality for COVID-19 based on deaths per million inhabitants. 2 However they did not take into account the differences in COVID-19 detection rates among the countries and the epidemic stages of the countries. Therefore we used a doubling time (DT) of the death toll as a more stable indicator. First, we investigated the DT of COVID-19 deaths in 47 countries (source: Our World in Data, 3 as of 5 April 2020). We defined the baseline date of each country as the date when fatalities of at least five people was first observed in the country. We covered all countries that have at least 10-day observation period and had a population of more than 1 million. To exclude the effect of social interventions, the death toll data of the country was truncated by 30 days after the baseline date (for China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Japan, and USA). Next, we surveyed the national BCG vaccination policies of each country (sources: BCG Atlas, 4 WHO-UNICEF report, 5 and other 12 papers). The 47 countries were divided into two groups based on whether the majority of the population between the ages of 0 and 29 was vaccinated ("BCG") or not ("non-BCG"). BCG vaccination records are reliable only for the last 30 years for several countries. Figure shows the distributions of DTs. Most of DTs for 32 "BCG" countries are longer than 15 "Non-BCG" (the median of the DTs are 3•9 and 3•1, respectively.) The variance of DTs of "BCG" countries was large ( 2.4) while DTs of "Non-BCG" are almost concentrated ( 1.1) in the short DT region. Based on Wilcoxson rank-sum test, the distributions of these two groups were significantly different at the significance level of 0.05 ( 0.004). We also investigated the dependency of the BCG strains. Among the 32 "BCG" countries, the median DT of the four countries using "Tokyo 172-1" strain (Japan, Iraq, Malaysia, and Pakistan) was 6.8, and that of the other 28 vaccinated countries was 3.8. Their distributions were also significantly different at the significance level of 0.05 ( 0.024). We showed a statistically significant difference of the doubling times of the death toll between "BCG" and "non-BCG" countries. The correlation might be a spurious and does not directly imply causality.
e9dda9694a2e4c405b84595621b777223793d69a	Functional protein microarrays are emerging as a promising new tool for large-scale and highthroughput studies. In this article, we will review their applications in basic proteomics research, where various types of assays have been developed to probe binding activities to other biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules, and glycans. We will also report recent progress of using functional protein microarrays in profiling protein posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and nitrosylation. Finally, we will discuss potential of functional protein microarrays in biomarker identification and clinical diagnostics. We strongly believe that functional protein microarrays will soon become an indispensible and invaluable tool in proteomics research and systems biology.
d9a9553aa9b46fb7e1db899a5fddd08ad00a632a	Korea has adopted Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers through the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) since 1999 for systematic control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Graduates of medical schools in Korea are selected and serve as public health doctors (PHDs) for their mandatory military service. The duration of service is 3 years and PHDs comprise general practitioners and specialists. Some PHDs are selected as EIS officers with 3 weeks basic FETP training and work for central and provincial public health authorities to conduct epidemiological investigations. The total number of EIS officers is 31 as of 2012. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has 12 specialists, whereas specialists and each province has one or two EIS officers to administer local epidemiological investigations in 253 public health centers. The Korean EIS officers have successfully responded and prevented infectious diseases, but there is a unique limitation: the number of PHDs in Korea is decreasing and PHDs are not allowed to stay outside Korea, which makes it difficult to cope with overseas infectious diseases. Furthermore, after 3 years service, they quit and their experiences are not accumulated. KCDC has hired full-time EIS officers since 2012 to overcome this limitation.

9345af20ecdce8136d3330d912b89f84da2b1943	Infectious diseases are a group of diseases which have complex transmission ways and various influencing factors. Clarifying the correlation between ambient temperature and major infectious diseases in China is a crucial step toward the successful control of infectious diseases including vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases, food-borne diseases, respiratory infectious diseases, etc. and the implementations of climate change adaption strategy and measures in China. However, no study has systematically reviewed the available evidences on the impact of ambient temperature on the incidence of major infectious diseases, and such information is essential for policymakers and stakeholders to take specific actions to control infectious diseases and protect the vulnerable population in the future. In order to fill this gap, we systematically review 5 76 the current evidence for the effect of ambient temperature on major infectious diseases in China. The findings could provide explicit information for the scientific prevention and control of infectious diseases in China.
5999e5bdbde2e8bfb3389bfe0ea96e229245cf67	Advances in genomics are contributing to the development of more effective, personalized approaches to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Genetic sequencing technologies are furthering our understanding of how human and pathogen genomic factors -and their interactions -contribute to individual differences in immunologic responses to vaccines, infections and drug therapies. Such understanding will influence future policies and procedures for infectious disease management. With the potential for tailored interventions for particular individuals, populations or subpopulations, ethical, legal and social implications (ELSIs) may arise for public health and clinical practice. Potential considerations include balancing health-related benefits and harms between individuals and the larger community, minimizing threats to individual privacy and autonomy, and ensuring just distribution of scarce resources. In this Opinion, we consider the potential application of pathogen and host genomic information to particular viral infections that have large-scale public health consequences but differ in ELSI-relevant characteristics such as ease of transmission, chronicity, severity, preventability and treatability. We argue for the importance of anticipating these ELSI issues in advance of new scientific discoveries, and call for the development of strategies for identifying and exploring ethical questions that should be considered as clinical, public health and policy decisions are made.
b12bcbc2620ce33faed7400f2b41410d724d1449	Objectives To identify the risk of general practitioner mortality from COVID and the impact of measures to mitigate this risk on the level and socioeconomic distribution of primary care provision in the English NHS Design Cross sectional study Setting All GP practices providing primary care under the NHS in England Participants 45,858 GPs and 6,771 GP practices in the English NHS Main outcome measures Numbers of high-risk GPs, high-risk single-handed GP practices, patients associated with these high-risk single-handed practices and the regional and socioeconomic distribution of each. Mortality rates from COVID by age, sex and ethnicity were used to attribute risk to GPs and the Index of Multiple Deprivation was used to determine socioeconomic distributions of the outcomes. Of 45,858 GPs in our sample 3,632 (7.9%) were classified as high risk or very high risk. Of 6,771 GP practices in our sample 639 (9.4%) were identified as singlehanded practices and of these 209 (32.7%) were run by a GP at high or very high risk. These 209 single-handed practices care for 710,043 patients. GPs at the highest levels of risk from COVID, and single-handed practices run by high-risk GPs were concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country. London had the highest proportion of both GPs and single-handed GP practices at very high risk of COVID mortality with 1,160 patients per 100,000 population registered to these practices. Conclusions A significant proportion of GPs working in England, particularly those serving patients in the most deprived neighbourhoods, are at high risk of dying from COVID. Many of these GPs run single-handed practices. These GPs are particularly concentrated in London. There is an opportunity to provide additional support to mitigate COVID risk for GPs, GP practices and their patients. Failure to do so will likely exacerbate existing health inequalities.
d8bbff461cf81610ea4335566c7e2a60bdd4ab05	Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an unprecedented global pandemic demanding the urgent development of therapeutic strategies. Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length-and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa-and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with higher affinity to heparin (KD 55 nM) compared to the receptor binding domain (RBD, KD 1 µM) alone. An octasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S could inhibit spike-heparin interaction with an IC50 of 38 nM. Our data supports a model in which the RBD of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 confers sequence specificity for HS expressed by target cells whereas an additional HS binding site in the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site enhances the avidity of binding. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.

We give a edge-weighted graph reduction of the dynamics of the process that allows us to apply standard results of Erdős-Renyi random graphs on the particle set. In particular, we show how the parameters of the model produce two phase transitions: In the subcritical regime, O(ln k) particles are infected. In the supercritical regime, for a constant C determined by the parameters of the model, Ck get infected with probability C, and O(ln k) get infected with probability (1 − C). Finally, there is a regime in which all k particles are infected. Furthermore, the edge weights give information about when a particle becomes infected. We demonstrate how this can be exploited to determine the completion time of the process by applying a result of Janson on randomly edge weighted graphs.

aa37211ba5110e94e0eb66faeab05d0e9a407c53	A total of 1,068 asymptomatic close contacts of patients with severe acute respiratory (SARS) from the 2003 epidemic in Hong Kong were serologically tested, and 2 (0.19%) were positive for SARS coronavirus immunoglobulin G antibody. SARS rarely manifests as a subclinical infection, and at present, wild animal species are the only important natural reservoirs of the virus.
ea2c4f7a47b6e68d911bcba59a6d0478a63a8639	The worldwide prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is estimated to be approaching 200 million people 1 . Current therapy relies upon a combination of pegylated interferon-a and ribavirin, a poorly tolerated regimen typically associated with less than 50% sustained virological response rate in those infected with genotype 1 virus 2,3 . The development of direct-acting antiviral agents to treat HCV has focused predominantly on inhibitors of the viral enzymes NS3 protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B 4 . Here we describe the profile of BMS-790052, a small molecule inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein that exhibits picomolar half-maximum effective concentrations (EC 50 ) towards replicons expressing a broad range of HCV genotypes and the JFH-1 genotype 2a infectious virus in cell culture. In a phase I clinical trial in patients chronically infected with HCV, administration of a single 100-mg dose of BMS-790052 was associated with a 3.3 log 10 reduction in mean viral load measured 24 h post-dose that was sustained for an additional 120 h in two patients infected with genotype 1b virus. Genotypic analysis of samples taken at baseline, 24 and 144 h post-dose revealed that the major HCV variants observed had substitutions at amino-acid positions identified using the in vitro replicon system. These results provide the first clinical validation of an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, a protein with no known enzymatic function, as an approach to the suppression of virus replication that offers potential as part of a therapeutic regimen based on combinations of HCV inhibitors. We designed a mechanistically unbiased approach based on chemical genetics to identify chemical starting points for interfering with HCV replication. Our differentiating strategy centred on the identification of compounds functionally distinct from those acting on the traditional targets of antiviral research in this field, the NS3 protease and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 5-7 . Using a Con-1 genotype 1b replicon replicating in Huh-7 liver cells 8 , we screened over one million compounds from the Bristol-Myers Squibb proprietary collection in high throughput mode. We used a dual assay format that simultaneously evaluated replication of the related flavivirus bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and host cell cytotoxicity as an efficient means of preliminarily eliminating compounds without specificity for HCV 9 . Active inhibitors were further triaged by evaluation in biochemical assays for NS3 protease, NS3 helicase and NS5B polymerase in addition to screening against a panel of unrelated viruses. The iminothiazolidinone BMS-858 (Fig. 1) emerged as a weak but, more importantly, specific inhibitor of HCV RNA replication (EC 50 5 0.57 mM, halfmaximum cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) 5 .50 mM) for which resistance was mapped to a tyrosine to histidine substitution at residue 93 in the NS5A protein (Y93H or Y2065H in the HCV polyprotein) 10 . BMS-858 formed the basis of an extensive series of chemical refinements that focused on improving antiviral potency, broadening inhibitory activity to encompass the HCV 1a genotype, and optimizing for oral bioavailability and sustained pharmacokinetic properties. After defining symmetry as an important contributor to antiviral activity 10 , a discovery that preceded the disclosure of structural information (see below), we subsequently identified BMS-790052 (Fig. 1 ) as a development candidate for advancement into clinical trials 11 . (The studies leading to the identification of BMS-790052 and its preclinical profiling will be the subject of a series of separate publications.) This compound is the most potent HCV replication inhibitor reported so far, with mean EC 50 values of 50 and 9 pM against genotype 1a and 1b replicons, respectively (data summarized in Table 1 ). BMS-790052 displays a therapeutic index (CC 50 /EC 50 ) of at least 100,000 in vitro and is inactive towards a panel of 10 RNA and DNA viruses, with EC 50 values greater than 10 mM, which confirms specificity for HCV (Supplementary Tables 1  and 2 ).

Short running head: Pancreatic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic This global survey among members of seven international pancreatic associations and study groups elucidates the role of pancreatic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, regarding patient selection for the surgical and oncological treatment of pancreatic diseases to support clinical decision-making and creating a starting point for further discussion.
f02a85b6b04b1b3defaf4832ee69bcfd19320cdb	To understand the scope and development of the COVID-19 pandemic, knowledge of the number of infected persons is essential. Often, the number of "confirmed cases", which is based on positive RT-PCR test results, is regarded as a reasonable indicator. However, limited COVID-19 test capacities in many countries are restricting the amount of testing that can be done. This can lead to the implementation of testing policies that restrict access to COVID-19 tests, and to testing backlogs and delays. As a result, confirmed case numbers can be significantly lower than the actual number of infections, especially during rapid growth phases of the epidemic. This study examines the quantitative relation between infections and reported confirmed case numbers for two different testing strategies, "limited" and "inclusive" testing, in relation to the growth rate of the epidemic. The results indicate that confirmed case numbers understate the actual number of infections substantially; during rapid growth phases where the daily growth rate can reach or exceed 30%, as has been seen in many countries, the confirmed case numbers under-report actual infections by up to 50 to 100-fold.
72a460598785cd8d63b4ea5e50fb5148c7392009	The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of maternal cells from colostrum on the development and function of the innate immune response in Holstein calves. Calves were divided into 2 groups: COL+ (n = 10) received fresh colostrum; and COL− (n = 10) which received frozen colostrum containing no viable cells. The calves were assessed before colostrum intake (D0), 48 h of age (D2), and weekly from D7 up to D28. Blood samples were collected for analysis of the distribution of leukocytes, cellular phenotype and in vitro granulocyte function. COL + calves tended to have a high number of neutrophils on D7 (p = 0.073). COL − calves took up significantly more Escherichia coli (measured as MFI) on D7 (p = 0.034). Endogenous production of radicals (as percentage of cells) tended to be higher in COL− calves on D14 (p = 0.061). The intensity of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by granulocytes tended to be higher in COL+ calves on D21 (p = 0.094). Overall, ROS production (percent of cells, and MFI) induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were higher in COL+ calves than COL− calves. It was our observation that COL+ calves developed an innate immune response more quickly and efficiently after natural exposure to pathogens after birth. In contrast, COL− calves mounted an innate response more slowly that yielded a persistent inflammatory response after natural exposure to these bacteria agents. This research provides evidence of an advantage to the calf of receiving fresh colostrum on the development and function of the innate immune system.

bdf14a6bd3df23e41d670416b6f0b345e1ebde7a	The need for multidisciplinary research to address today's complex health and environmental challenges has never been greater. The One Health (OH) approach to research ensures that human, animal, and environmental health questions are evaluated in an integrated and holistic manner to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions than would be possible with siloed approaches. However, the OH approach is complex, and there is limited guidance available for investigators regarding the practical design and implementation of OH research. In this paper we provide a framework to guide researchers through conceptualizing and planning an OH study. We discuss key steps in designing an OH study, including conceptualization of hypotheses and study aims, identification of collaborators for a multi-disciplinary research team, study design options, data sources and collection methods, and analytical methods. We illustrate these concepts through the presentation of a case study of health impacts associated with land application of biosolids. Finally, we discuss opportunities for applying an OH approach to identify solutions to current global health issues, and the need for cross-disciplinary funding sources to foster an OH approach to research.
4ef9dc3571f2bb74b54c59e35f001938b9464a60	The current COVID-19 pandemic has recently brought to attention the myriad of neurologic sequelae associated with Coronavirus infection including the predilection for stroke, particularly in young patients. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a well-described clinical syndrome leading to vasoconstriction in the intracranial vessels, and has been associated with convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage and occasionally cervical artery dissection. It is usually reported in the context of a trigger such as medications, recreational drugs, or the postpartum state; however, it has not been described in COVID-19 infection. We report a case of both cervical vertebral ar-tery dissection as well as convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage due to RCVS, in a pa-tient with COVID-19 infection and no other triggers.
cf0dd4d9f9f906626d5bc4a01e1f1eb21806291c	The International Health Regulations (2005) and the emergence and global spread of infectious diseases have triggered a re-assessment of how rich countries should support capacity development for communicable disease control in low and medium income countries (LMIC). In LMIC, three types of public health training have been tried: the university-based model; streamed training for specialised workers; and field-based programs. The first has low rates of production and teaching may not always be based on the needs and priorities of the host country. The second model is efficient, but does not accord the workers sufficient status to enable them to impact on policy. The third has the most potential as a capacity development measure for LMIC, but in practice faces challenges which may limit its ability to promote capacity development. We describe Australia's first Master of Applied Epidemiology (MAE) model (established in 1991), which uses field-based training to strengthen the control of communicable diseases. A central attribute of this model is the way it partners and complements health department initiatives to enhance workforce skills, health system performance and the evidencebase for policies, programs and practice. The MAE experience throws light on ways Australia could collaborate in regional capacity development initiatives. Key needs are a shared vision for a regional approach to integrate training with initiatives that strengthen service and research, and the pooling of human, financial and technical resources. We focus on communicable diseases, but our findings and recommendations are generalisable to other areas of public health.
97e07d83db421faee2a7a42a0e2c8a117c08b016	The domestic cat has offered enormous genomic potential in the veterinary description of over 250 hereditary disease models as well as the occurrence of several deadly feline viruses (feline leukemia virus --FeLV, feline coronavirus --FECV, feline immunodeficiency virus -FIV) that are homologues to human scourges (cancer, SARS, and AIDS respectively). However, to realize this bio-medical potential, a high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map is required in order to accomplish disease and phenotype association discovery. To remedy this, we generated 3,178,297 paired fosmid-end Sanger sequence reads from seven cats, and combined these data with the publicly available 2X cat whole genome sequence. All sequence reads were assembled together to form a 3X whole genome assembly allowing the discovery of over three million SNPs. To reduce potential false positive SNPs due to the low coverage assembly, a low upper-limit was placed on sequence coverage and a high lower-limit on the quality of the discrepant bases at a potential variant site. In all domestic cats of different breeds: female Abyssinian, female American shorthair, male Cornish Rex, female European Burmese, female Persian, female Siamese, a male Ragdoll and a female African wildcat were sequenced lightly. We report a total of 964 k common SNPs suitable for a domestic cat SNP genotyping array and an additional 900 k SNPs detected between African wildcat and domestic cats breeds. An empirical sampling of 94 discovered SNPs were tested in the sequenced cats resulting in a SNP validation rate of 99%. These data provide a large collection of mapped feline SNPs across the cat genome that will allow for the development of SNP genotyping platforms for mapping feline diseases. Figure 2 SNP distribution. The fraction of windows with one or more SNPs for a range of window sizes and three categories of SNPs: all SNPs, all except Cinnamon and all except Cinnamon and Nancy.

These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID-19 resource centre remains active. Bronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first year of life. Clinical guidelines recom mend primarily supportive care and discourage use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics. However, there con tinues to be widespread use of nonrecommended therapies and variation in the use of therapeutic interventions among hospitals in the United States. Here we review evidence-based man agement of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and de crease unnecessary hospitalization. Current evidence does not support the routine use of chest radiographs, viral testing or laboratory evaluation in chil dren with bronchiolitis. In addition, rou tine administration of bronchodilators, including albuterol and nebulized epi nephrine, corticosteroids and hypertonic saline are not recommended for infants and children with bronchiolitis. Intrave nous or nasogastric hydration and nutri tional support, supplemental oxygen, and respiratory support are recom mended. Standardization of bronchiolitis care with evidence based institutional clinical pathways spanning ED to inpa tient care can help optimize resource utilization while simultaneously improv ing care of bronchiolitis and reducing hospital length of stays and costs.
2406311fdb93aeb0257bff62ed5800ca5e2bd8ad	Milk fat comprises membrane-coated droplets of neutral lipid, which constitute the predominant source of lipids for survival of the suckling neonate. From the perspective of the dairy industry, they are the basis for the manufacture of butter and essential ingredients in the production of cheese, yogurt, and specialty dairy produce. To provide mechanistic insight into the assembly and secretion of lipid droplets during lactation, we developed novel intravital imaging techniques using transgenic mice, which express fluorescently tagged marker proteins. The number 4 mammary glands were surgically prepared under a deep plane of anesthesia and the exposed glands positioned as a skin flap with intact vascular supply on the stage of a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Lipid droplets were stained by prior exposure of the glands to hydrophobic fluorescent BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene) dyes and their formation and secretion monitored by time-lapse subcellular microscopy over periods of 1 to 2 h. Droplets were transported to the cell apex by directed (superdiffusive) motion at relatively slow and intermittent rates (0-2 µm/min). Regardless of size, droplets grew by numerous fusion events during transport and as they were budding from the cell enveloped by apical membranes. Surprisingly, droplet secretion was not constitutive but required an injection of oxytocin to induce contraction of the myoepithelium with subsequent release of droplets into luminal spaces. These novel results are discussed in the context of the current paradigm for milk fat synthesis and secretion and as a template for future innovations in the dairy industry. Figure 3. Steps in the preparation of transgenic mice, which express GFP-tagged proteins for intravital imaging of lipid droplets (LD).

be69c9781f14d5d030629cc9a214d938d2e0c410	This paper proposed a novel and straightforward approach to improve the accuracy of progressive multiple protein sequence alignment. We trained a decision-making model based on the convolutional neural networks and bi-directional long short term memory networks, and based on this model, we progressively aligned the input sequences by calculating different posterior probability matrixes. To test the accuracy of this approach, we have implemented a multiple sequence alignment tool called DLPAlign and compared its performance with eleven leading alignment methods on three empirical alignment benchmarks (BAliBASE, OXBench and SABMark). Our results show that DLPAlign can get the best total-column scores on the three benchmarks. When evaluated against the 711 low similarity families with average PID ≤ 30%, DLPAlign improved about 2.8% over the second-best MSA software. Besides, we also compared the performance of DLPAlign and other alignment tools on a real-life application, namely protein secondary structure prediction on four protein sequences related to SARS-COV-2, and DLPAlign provides the best result in all cases.
12d9952ba3cf8410eff072c9ec3b62447457122d	Bats are the natural host reservoir for range of emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which cause significant morbidity and mortality in other mammals, yet appear to result in no clinical consequences for bats. The ability of bats to coexist with a variety of viruses presents an interesting immunological problem that has not been examined in any detail but which could provide significant insights into the evolution of antiviral mechanisms in mammals. Towards a better understanding of the bat immune system, we analysed the expressed heavy chain variable (VH) regions of antibodies from the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto. The germline repertoire of the closely related Pteropid bat, Pteropus vampyrus, whose genome has been sequenced was also examined for comparative purposes. Representative VH genes were found in all three mammalian VH clans (I, II and III) in both the expressed P. alecto VH repertoire and the germline P. vampyrus VH repertoire. Evidence for the use of multiple heavy chain diversity (DH) and joining (JH) segments for the generation of diverse VDJ rearrangements was also present in the expressed antibody repertoire of P. alecto. The long period of co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses may have resulted in a variety of highly specific VH segments being hardwired into the genomes of bats and may have implications for their ability to successfully cope with a diversity of viral antigens.
283b6d58bb79b9df97c65b568977fa060aafbe3c	It has become increasingly clear that the COVID-19 epidemic is characterized by overdispersion whereby the majority of the transmission is driven by a minority of infected individuals. Such a strong departure from the homogeneity assumptions of the traditional wellmixed compartment model is usually hypothesized to be the result of short-term super-spreader events, such as an individual's extreme rate of virus shedding at the peak of infectivity while attending a large gathering without appropriate mitigation. However, we demonstrate that the spread of epidemics is primarily sensitive to longterm, or persistent heterogeneity of individual susceptibility or infectivity. We demonstrate how to incorporate this heterogeneity into a wide class of epidemiological models, and derive a non-linear dependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the susceptible population fraction S. Persistent heterogeneity has three important consequences compared to the effects of short-term overdispersion: (1) It results in a major modification of the early epidemic dynamics; (2) It significantly suppresses the herd immunity threshold; (3) It also significantly reduces the final size of the epidemic. We estimate social and biological contributions to persistent heterogeneity using data on real-life face-to-face contact networks and age variation of the incidence rate during the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, as well as 50 US states provide a consistent characterization of the level of heterogeneity. Our estimates suggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, are close to the heterogeneitymodified herd immunity threshold following the first wave of the epidemic. However, this type of immunity is fragile as it wanes over time if the pattern of social interactions changes substantially. The COVID-19 pandemic is nearly unprecedented in the level of disruption it has caused globally, but also, potentially, in the degree to which it will change our understanding of epidemic dynamics and the efficacy of various mitigation strategies. Ever since the pioneering works of Kermack and McKendrick (1), epidemiological models have been widely and successfully used to quantify and predict progression of infectious diseases (2-6). More recently, the important role played by population heterogeneity and the complex structure of social networks in spreading of epidemics has been appreciated and highlighted in multiple studies (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . However, an adequate integration of this conceptual progress into reliable, predictive epidemiological models remains a formidable task. Among the key effects of heterogeneity and social network structure are (i) the role played by superspreaders and superspreading events during initial outbreaks (8, 9, 14, (23) (24) (25) and (ii) substantial corrections to the herd immunity threshold (HIT) and the final size of epidemic (FSE) (10, 13, 15, 18, 22, 26) . The COVID-19 pandemic has re-ignited interest in the effects of heterogeneity of individual susceptibility to the disease, in particular to the possibility that it might lower both . There are several existing approaches to model the effects of heterogeneity on epidemic dynamics, each focusing on a different characteristic and parameterization. In the first approach, one can stratify the population into several demographic groups (e.g. by age), and account for variation in susceptibility of these groups and their mutual contact probabilities (2). While this approach represents many aspects of population dynamics beyond the homogeneous and wellmixed assumption, it clearly does not encompass the whole complexity of individual heterogeneity, interpersonal communications and spatial and social structures. These details can be addressed in a second approach, where one analyzes epidemic dynamics on real-world or artificial social networks (9, 18, 32, 33) . Through elegant mathematics, it is possible to obtain detailed results in idealized cases, including the mapping onto well-understood models of statistical physics such as percolation (10). In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, this mapping suggests that the worst-case FSE may be significantly smaller than expected from classical homogeneous models (27). Such methods have so far been mostly limited to analysis of the final state of epidemics and outbreaks on a static network. This study demonstrates how a wide class of epidemiological models can be adapted for applications to heterogeneous populations in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. It is shown that a persistent heterogeneity, rather than bursty short-term variations in infection transmission is responsible for self-limiting epidemic dynamics. Compact generalizations of the classical results for the herd immunity threshold and the final size of an epidemic are derived. The degree of persistent heterogeneity is estimated from data on real-life face-to-face contact networks, and on age variation of susceptibility to COVID-19. The estimate is further supported by the analysis of the empirical data from the epidemic in NYC and Chicago, as well as in 50 US states. The results suggest that by the end of the first wave of the epidemic, the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, have been close to the heterogeneity-modified herd immunity, thereby limiting their vulnerability to a potential second wave of the epidemic. For practical purposes, it is desirable to predict the complete time-dependent dynamics of an epidemic, preferably by explicitly including heterogeneity into classical well-mixed mean-field compartment models. This third approach was developed long ago (13, 18) ,and has recently been applied in the context of . Here, the conclusion was that the HIT may be well below that expected in classical homogeneous models. These approaches to heterogeneity delineate end-members of a continuum of theories: overdispersion describing shortterm, bursty dynamics (e.g. due to super-spreader accidents), as opposed to persistent heterogeneity, which is a long-term characteristic of an individual and reflects behavioral propensity to (e.g.) socialize in large gatherings without prudent social distancing. Overdispersion is usually modeled in terms of a negative binomial branching process (8, 9, 14, (23) (24) (25) , and is expected to be a much stronger source of variation compared to the longer-term characteristics that reflect persistent heterogeneity. How, then, can we bridge the gap between these model end-members in order to calculate both the herd immunity threshold and the final size of the epidemic in a unified way that treats the dynamics on long time-scales? In this work, we present a comprehensive yet simple theory that accounts for both social and biological aspects of heterogeneity, and predicts how together they modify early and intermediate epidemic dynamics, as well as global characteristics of the epidemic such as the herd immunity threshold and the final size of the epidemic. Our starting point is a generalized version of the heterogeneous well-mixed theory in the spirit of Ref. (13), but we use the age-of-infection approach (1) rather than compartmentalized SIR/SEIR models of epidemic dynamics (see, e.g. (2)). The resulting model can be recast into an effective homogeneous theory that can readily encompass a wide class of epidemiological models, including various versions of the popular SIR/SEIR approaches. Specific innovations that emerge from our analysis are the non-linear dependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the overall population fraction S of susceptible individuals, and another non-linear function Se(S) that gives an effective susceptible fraction, taking into account preferential removal of highly susceptible individuals. A convenient and practically useful aspect of this approach is that it does not require extensive additional calibration in order to be applied to real data. In the effort to make quantitative predictions from epidemic models, accurate calibration is arguably the most difficult step, but is necessary due to the extreme instability of epidemic dynamics in both growth and decay phases (34, 35) . We find that with our approach, the entire effect of heterogeneity is in many cases well-characterized by a single parameter which we call the immunity factor λ. It is related to statistical properties of heterogeneous susceptibility across the population and to its correlation with individual infectivity. The immunity factor determines the rate at which Re drops during the early stages of the epidemic as the pool of susceptibles is being depleted: Re ≈ R0(1 − λ(1 − S)). Beyond this early linear regime, for an important case of gamma-distributed individual susceptibilities, we show that the classical proportionality, Re = R0S, transforms into a power-law scaling relationship Re = R0S λ . This leads to a modified version of the result for the herd immunity threshold , S0 = R −1/λ 0 , and a corresponding result for the final size of an unmitigated epidemic. Heterogeneity in the susceptibility of individual members of the population has several different contributions: (i) biological, which takes into account differences in factors such as strength of immune response, genetics, age, and co-morbidities; and (ii) social, reflecting differences in the number of close contacts of different people. The immunity factor λ in our model combines these sources of heterogeneous susceptibility as well as its correlation with individual infectivity. As we demonstrate, under certain assumptions, the immunity factor is simply a product of social and biological contributions: λ = λsλ b . In our study, we leverage existing studies of real-life face-to-face contact networks (9, 15, 33, (36) (37) (38) (39) to estimate the social contribution to heterogeneous susceptibility, and the corresponding immunity factor λs. The biological contribution, λ b , is expected to depend on specific details of each infection. For the case of COVID 19, we determine a lower bound for it, based on the age distribution of reported cases. To test this theory, we use the empirical data on COVID-19 epidemic to independently estimate the immunity factor λ. In particular, we apply our previously-described epidemic model that features multi-channel Bayesian calibration (34) to describe epidemic dynamics in New York City and Chicago. This model uses high quality data on hospitalizations, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) occupancy and daily deaths to extract the underlying Re(S) dependence in each of two cities. In addition, we perform a similar analysis of data on individual states in the USA, using data generated by the model in Ref. (40) . Using both approaches, we find that the locations that were severely impacted by COVID-19 epidemic show a more pronounced reduction of the effective reproduction number. This effect is much stronger than predicted by classical homogeneous models, suggesting a significant role of heterogeneity. The estimated immunity factor ranges between 4 and 5, and is in very good agreement with the value expected based on analysis of social and biological heterogeneity. This analysis shows how our model is able to make concrete and testable predictions. Finally, we integrate the persistent heterogeneity theory into our time-of-infection epidemiological model (34), and project possible outcomes of the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC and Chicago. By considering the worst-case scenario of a full relaxation of any currently imposed mitigation, we find that the results of the heterogeneity-modified model significantly modify the results from the homogeneous mode. In particular, based on our estimate of the immunity factor, we expect virtually no second wave in NYC, indicating that the herd immunity has likely been achieved there. Chicago, on the other hand, has not passed the herd immunity threshold that we infer, but the effects of heterogeneity would still result in a substantial reduction of the magnitude of the second wave there, even under the worst-case scenario. This, in turn, suggests that the second wave can be completely eliminated in such medium-hit locations, if appropriate and economically mild mitigation measures are adopted, including e.g. mask wearing, contact tracing, and targeted limitation of potential super-spreading events, through limitations on indoor bars, dining and other venues. 2 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.XXXXXXXXXX Tkachenko et al. Following in the footsteps of Refs. (12, 13, 15, 18, 26, 28) , we consider the spread of an epidemic in a population of individuals who exhibit significant heterogeneity in their susceptibilities to infection α. This heterogeneity may be biological or social in origin, and we assume these factors are independent: α = α b αs. The biologically-driven heterogeneous susceptibility α b is shaped by variations of several intrinsic factors such as the strength of individuals' immune responses, age, or genetics. In contrast, the socially-driven heterogeneous susceptibility αs is shaped by extrinsic factors, such as differences in individuals' social interaction patterns (their degree in the network of social interactions). Furthermore, individuals' different risk perceptions and attitudes towards social distancing may further amplify variations in socially-driven susceptibility heterogeneity. We only focus on susceptibility that is a persistent property of an individual. For example, people who have elevated occupational hazards, such as healthcare workers, typically have higher, steady values of αs. Similarly, people with low immune response, highly social individuals (hubs in social networks), or scofflaws would all be characterized by above-average overall susceptibility α. In this work, we group individuals into sub-populations with similar values of α and describe the heterogeneity of the overall population by the probability density function (pdf) of this parameter, f (α). Since α is a relative measure of individual susceptibilities, without loss of generality we set α ≡ ∞ 0 αf (α)dα = 1. Each person is also assigned an individual reproduction number Ri, which is an expected number of people that this person would infect in a fully susceptible population with α = 1. Accordingly, from each sub-population with susceptibility α there is a respective mean reproductive number Rα. Any correlations between individual susceptibility and infectivity will significantly impact the epidemic dynamics. Such correlations are an integral part of most network-based epidemiological models due to the assumed reciprocity in underlying social interactions, which leads to Rα ∼ α (10, 18). In reality, not all transmissions involve face-to-face contacts, and biological susceptibility need not be strongly correlated with infectivity. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect only a partial correlation between α and Rα. Let Sα(t) be the fraction of susceptible individuals in the subpopulation with susceptibility α, and let jα(t) = −Ṡα be the corresponding daily incident rate, i.e., the fraction of newly infected individuals per day in that sub-population. At the start of the epidemic, we assume everyone is susceptible to infection: Sα(0) = 1. The course of the epidemic is described by the following age-of-infection model: Here t is the physical time and τ is the time since infection for an individual. . . . α represents averaging over α with pdf f (α). J(t) represents the mean daily attack rate across the entire population. K(τ ) is the distribution of the generation interval, which we assume is independent of α for the sake of simplicity. According to Eq. (1), the susceptible subpopulation for any α is expressed as Here Z(t) = t 0 J(t )dt represents the cumulative attack rate. The total susceptible fraction of the population is related to the moment generating function Mα of the distribution f (α) (i.e., the Laplace transform of f (α)) according to: Similarly, the effective reproductive number Re can be expressed in terms of the parameter Z: Note that for Z = 0, this expression gives the basic reproduction number R0 = αRα . Since both S and Re depend on time only through Z(t), Eqs. (4)-(5) establish a parametric relationship between these two important quantities during the time course of an epidemic. In contrast to the classical case when these two quantities are simply proportional to each other, i.e. Re = SR0, the relationship in the present theory is non-linear due to heterogeneity. Now one can re-write the renewal equation for the daily attack rate in the same form that it would have for a homogeneous problem: Furthermore, by integrating Eqn. (1) over the whole susceptible population, we arrive at the following heterogeneityinduced modification to the relationship between the attack and the incident rates: Here is the effective susceptible fraction of the population, which is less than S due to the disproportionate removal of highly susceptible individuals. Just as with Re, it is a non-linear function of S, defined parametrically by Eqs. (4),(8). Further generalization of this theory for the time-modulated age-ofinfection model is presented in the Supplementary Information (SI). There, we also discuss the adaptation of this approach for the important special case of a compartmentalized SIR/SEIR model. Such non-linear modifications to homogeneous epidemiological models have been proposed in the past, both as plausible descriptions of heterogeneous populations and in other contexts (15, 20, 21). However, those empirical models exhibited a limited range of applicability (15) and have not had a solid mechanistic foundation, with a noticeable exception of a special case of SIR model without correlation between susceptibility and infectivity studied in Ref. (26). Our approach is more general: it provides an exact mapping of a wide class of heterogeneous well-mixed models onto homogeneous ones, and provides a specific relationship between the underlying Tkachenko et al. PNAS | August 20, 2020 | vol. XXX | no. XX | 3 statistics of α and Rα and the non-linear functions Re(S) and Se(S). We now derive a simple yet remarkably general result for the final size of an unmitigated epidemic. To do this, we integrate Eq. (6) over time t. This yields a relation Z∞ = ∞ 0 Re(t)J(t)dt = 1 S∞ Re(S)dS/Se(S) for the final value of Z when the epidemic has run its course, and this in turn can conveniently be expressed in terms of the final fraction of the susceptible population, S∞: This equation is valid for an arbitrary distribution of α, arbitrary correlation between susceptibility and infectivity, and for any statistics of the generation interval. It combines and generalizes several well-known results: (i) in the weak correlation limit (Rα = R0), when the integral in the r.h.s. is equal to R0(1 − S∞), Eq. (9) reproduces results of Refs. (22, 26, 30), (ii) in the opposite limit of a strong correlation (Rα ∼ α), the integration gives R0(1 − Se(S∞))/ α 2 , and one recovers the result for the FSE on a network (10, 13). One of the striking consequences of the non-linearity of Re(S) is that the effective reproduction number could be decreasing at the early stages of epidemics significantly faster than predicted by homogeneous models. Specifically, for (1 − S) 1 one obtains We named the coefficient λ the immunity factor because it quantifies the effect that a reduction in the susceptible population due to immunity has on the spread of an epidemic. The classical value of λ is 1, but it may be significantly larger in a heterogeneous case. λ = α 2 Rα αRα [11] As one can see, the value of the immunity factor, thus depends both on the statistics of susceptibility, and on its correlation with infectivity Rα. We previously defined the overall susceptibility α as a combination of biological and social factors: α = αsα b Here αs is a measure of the overall social connectivity of an individual, such as the cumulative time of close contact with other individuals averaged over a sufficiently long time interval (known as node strength in network science). Since the interpersonal contacts contribution to an epidemic spread is mostly reciprocal, we assume Rα ∼ αs. On the other hand, in our analysis we neglect a correlation between the biological susceptibility and infectivity, as well as between α b and αs. Under these approximations, the immunity factor itself is a product of biological and social contributions, λ = λ b λs. Each of them can be expressed in terms of leading moments of α b and αs, respectively: Note that the biological contribution to the immunity factor depends only on the coefficient of variation CV b of α b . On the other hand, the social factor λs depends both on the coefficient of variation CVs and the skewness γs of the distribution of αs. Due to our normalization, αs α b ≈ αsα b = α = 1. The relative importance of biological and social contributions to the overall heterogeneity of α may be characterized by a single parameter χ. For a log-normal distribution of α b , χ appears as a scaling exponent between infectivity and susceptibility: Rα ∼ α χ (see it SI Appendix for details). The corresponding expression for the overall immunity factor is λ = α 2+χ / α 1+χ . The limit χ = 0 corresponds to a predominantly biological nature of heterogeneity, i.e., λ ≈ λ b = 1 + CV 2 α where CVα is the coefficient of variation for the overall susceptibility. In the opposite limit χ = 1, the variation is primarily of social origin, hence λ ≈ λs will be affected by both CVα and the skewness γα of the pdf f (α). Recently, real-world networks of face-to-face communications have been studied using a variety of tools, including RFID devices (36), Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wearable tags, smartphone apps (37, 38), as well as census data and personal surveys (9, 33, 39) . Despite coming from a wide variety of contexts, the major features of contact networks are remarkably robust. In particular, both the degree (the number of contacts per person), and the node strength pdfs appear nearly constant when plotted in log-log coordinates, followed up by a sharp fall after a certain cut-off. This behavior is generally consistent with an exponential distribution in fs(αs) (15, 37, 39) , fs(αs) ∼ e −αs/ αs , leading to λs ≈ 3!/2! = 3. The biological contribution λ b depends on specific biological details of the disease and thus is unlikely to be as universal and robust as the social one. For the COVID-19 epidemic, we estimated this parameter based on the the age distribution of cases as reported by the NYC Department of Health (41). This analysis suggests λ b = 1 + CV 2 b ≈ 1.3. On one hand, the variation in the infection rates reported among different age groups may be exaggerated by the variation of the disease severity. On the other hand, age is not the only factor that determines biological susceptibility: it may also depend on genetics, pre-existing conditions, etc. The overall immunity factor, based on this rather conservative estimate is λ ≈ 4. So far, our discussion has focused on the early stages of epidemics, when the Re(S) dependence is given by a linearized expression Eq. (10). To describe the non-linear regime, we consider a gamma-distributed susceptibility: f (α) ∼ α 1/η−1 exp(−α/η), where η = CV 2 α . In this case, according to Eqs. (4) and (5), Re, Se and S are related by scaling relationships: and The exponent λ = 1+(1+χ)CV 2 α = 1+(1+χ)η coincides with the early-epidemics immunity factor defined in Eqs. (10)-(11) for a general case. Note that without correlation (χ = 0), both scaling exponents would be the same; this result has been previously obtained for the SIR model in Ref. (26) The scaling behavior Re(S) is shown in Fig. 1(A) for λ = 4 ± 1 . This function is dramatically different from the classical linear dependence Re = SR0. To emphasize the importance of this difference, we indicate the estimated fractions of the population in New York City and Chicago susceptible to COVID-19, as of the end of May 2020. It is evident from the plot that the reduction of Re for immunity factor between 3 and 5 4 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.XXXXXXXXXX Tkachenko et al. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 S 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 R e /R 0 Chicago NYC HIT range for COVID-19 (R 0 =2.0-3.5) A 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 R 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1-S COVID-19 range B Fig. 1. A) Re/R vs S dependence for gamma-distributed susceptibility for λ = 4 ± 1 (blue area). The dashed line shows the classical homogeneous result, Re = R0S. Note a substantial reduction of Re for COVID-19 in both NYC and Chicago, compared to that value. Approximate fractions of susceptible populations, S, for both cities are estimated as of the end of May 2020, by using the model described in Ref. (34). B) Herd Immunity threshold (blue area) and final size of epidemic (FSE, green area) for gamma-distributed susceptibilities. The range of λ is the same as in (A). FSE is shown assuming maximum correlation between susceptibility and infectivity (χ = 1), which corresponds to CV 2 α ranging from 1 to 2. Notice a substantial reduction of both HIT and FSE compared to the classical results for homogeneous population which are shown as blue dashed and green dotted lines, respectively. may substantially reduce or eliminate the chances of future outbreaks in both cities. Eq. (15) immediately leads to a major revision of the classical result S0 = 1/R0 for the herd immunity threshold, i.e. the fraction of susceptible population below which the exponential growth stops. By setting Re = 1 in Eq. (15), we obtain: An unmitigated epidemic of course does not stop once the HIT is passed, but continues until there are no more infected individuals left, a phenomenon known as overshoot. To find the FSE for the case of gamma-distributed susceptibility we apply our general result, Eq. 9, which gives: The values of HIT and FSE for various values of R0 are presented in Figure 1B . As expected, in both cases the number of remaining susceptible individuals is substantially larger than in the homogeneous case. Our focus on the gamma distribution is well justified by the observation that the social strength αs is approximately exponentially distributed, i.e., it is a specific case of the gamma distribution with η = CV 2 α = 1. A moderate biological heterogeneity would lead to an increase of the overall CVα, but the pdf f (α) will still be close to the gamma distribution family. From the conceptual point of view, it is nevertheless important to understand how the function Re(S) would change if f (α) had a different form. In SI Appendix, we present analytic and numerical calculations for two other families of distributions: (i) an exponentially bounded power law f (α) ∼ e −α/α + /α q (q ≥ 1, with an additional cut-off at lower values of α) and (ii) the log-normal distribution. In addition, we give an approximate analytic result that generalizes Eq. (15) for arbitrary skewness of f (α). This generalization works remarkably well for all three of the families of distributions analyzed in this work. As suggested by Eqs. (12)-(13), when the distribution becomes increasingly skewed, the range between the χ = 0 and χ = 1 curves broadens. For instance, for distributions dominated by a power law, f (α) ∼ 1/α q , λ diverges at q slightly larger than 3 and χ = 1, even if CVα remains finite. This represents a crossover to the regime of so-called scale-free networks (2 ≤ q ≤ 3, which are characterized by zero epidemic threshold yet strongly self-limited dynamics: the epidemics effectively kills itself by immunizing the hubs on the network (13, 18, 42) . The COVID-19 epidemic reached the US in early 2020, and by March it was rapidly spreading across multiple states. The early dynamics was characterized by a rapid rise in the number of cases with doubling times as low as 2 days. In response to this, the majority of states imposed a broad range of mitigation measures including school closures, limits on public gatherings, and Stay-at-Home orders. In many regions, especially the hardest hit ones like New York City, people started to practice some degree of social distancing even before government-mandated mitigation. In order to quantify the effects of heterogeneity on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, we apply the Bayesian age-of-infection model described in Ref. (34) to New York City and Chicago. For both cities, we have access to reliable time series data on hospitalization, ICU room occupancy, and daily deaths due to [43][44][45]. We used these data to perform multi-channel calibration of our model (34), which allows us to infer the underlying time progression of both S(t) and Re(t). The fits for Re(S) for both cities are shown in Fig. 2A . In both cases, a sharp drop of Re that occurred during the early stage of the epidemic is followed by a more gradual decline. For NYC, there is an extended range over which Re(S) has a constant slope in logarithmic coordinate. This is consistent with the power law behavior predicted by Eq. 15 with the slope corresponding to immunity factor Tkachenko et al. PNAS | August 20, 2020 | vol. XXX | no. XX | 5 λ = 4.5 ± 0.05. Chicago exhibits a similar behavior but over a substantially narrower range of S. This reflects the fact that NYC was much harder hit by the COVID-19 epidemic. Importantly, the range of dates we used to estimate the immunity factor corresponds to the time interval after state-mandated Stay-At-Home orders were imposed, and before the mitigation measures began to be gradually relaxed. The signatures of the onset of the mitigation and of its partial relaxation are clearly visible on both ends of the constant-slope regime. To examine the possible effects of variable levels of mitigation on our estimates of λ in Fig. S2 we repeated our analysis in which Re(t) was corrected by Google's community mobility report in these two cities (46) (see SI Appendix). Although the range of data consistent with the constant slope shrank somewhat, our main conclusion remains unchanged. This provided us with a lower bound estimate for the immunity factor: λ = 4.1 ± 0.1. 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1 susceptible population fraction, S(t) 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 R e (t)/R 0 NYC Chicago NYC, best fit: =4.5 0.05 A 0.84 0.86 0.88 0.9 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98 1 Susceptible population fraction, S(t) 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 R e t)/R 0 AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY 50 states + DC slope: =5.3 0.6 B Fig. 2. Correlation between the relative reduction in the effective reproduction number Re(t)/R0 (y-axis) with the susceptible population S(t). In Panel A, we present the progression of these two quantities for New York City and Chicago, as given by the epidemiological model described in Ref. (34). Panel B shows the scatter plot of Re(t0)/R0 and S(t0) in individual states of the US, evaluated in Ref. (40) (t0 is the latest date covered in that study). To test the sensitivity of our results to details of the epidemiological model and choice of the region we performed an alternative analysis based on the data reported in (40). In that study, the COVID-19 epidemic was modelled in each of the 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Because of the differences in population density, level of urbanization, use of public transport, etc., different states were characterized by substantially different initial growth rates of the epidemic, as quantified by the basic reproduction number R0. Furthermore, the time of arrival of the epidemic also varied a great deal between individual states, with states hosting major airline transportation hubs being among the earliest ones hit by the virus. As a result of these differences, at any given time the infected fraction of the population differed significantly across the US (40). We use state level estimates of Re(t), R0 and S(t) as reported in Ref. (40) to construct the scatter plot Re(t0)/R0 vs S(t0) shown in 2, with t0 chosen to be the last reported date in that study, May 17, 2020. By performing the linear regression on these data in logarithmic coordinates, we obtain the fit for the slope λ = 5.3 ± 0.6 and for S = 1 intercept around 0.54. In Fig. S3 (see SI Appendix), we present an extended version of this analysis for the 10 hardest-hit states and the District of Columbia, which takes into account the overall time progression of Re(t) and S(t), and gives similar estimate λ = 4.7 ± 1.5. Both estimates of the immunity factor based on the state data are consistent with our earlier analysis of NYC and Chicago. Furthermore, the range of λ between 4 and 5 extracted from these COVID-19 data sources, is in a very good agreement with the value λ = λsλ b ≈ 4 that we obtained above, based on the statistics of interpersonal contacts and the age variation of biological susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. We can now incorporate heterogeneity into our epidemiological model, and examine how future projections change as a result of this modification. This is done by plugging the scaling relationships, Eq. (14)-(15) into the attack rate and incident rate equations of the original model. These equations are similar to Eqs. (6)-(7), but also include time modulation due to mitigation and a possible seasonal forcing (see SI Appendix for more details). After calibrating the model by using the data streams on ICU occupancy, hospitalization and daily deaths up to the end of May, we explore a hypothetical worst-case scenario in which any mitigation is completely relaxed as of June 1, in both Chicago and NYC. In other words, the basic reproduction number R0 is set back to its value at the initial stage of the epidemic, and the only factor limiting the second wave is the partial or full herd immunity, Re = R0S λ . The projected daily deaths for each of the two cities under this (unrealistically harsh) scenario are presented in Fig. 3 for various values of λ. For both cities, the homogeneous model (λ = 1, blue lines) predicts a second wave which is larger than the first one with an additional death toll of around 35, 000 in NYC and 12, 800 in Chicago. The magnitude of the second wave is greatly reduced by heterogeneity, resulting in no second wave in either of the two cities for λ = 5 (black lines). Even for a modest value λ = 3 (red lines), which is less than our estimate, the second wave is dramatically reduced in both NYC and Chicago (by about 90% and 70%, respectively).
8b67f5f9d47d2b424644f47fd58f0feeff045029	The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought great threat to human health. Its causative agent is a severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus which has been officially named SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the discovery of extremely low CG abundance in its open reading frames. We found that CG reduction in SARS-CoV-2 is achieved mainly through mutating C/G into A/T, and CG is the best target for mutation. Meanwhile, 5′-untranslated region of SARS-CoV-2 has high CG content and is capable of forming an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to recruit host ribosome for translating its RNA. These features allow SARS-CoV-2 to reproduce efficiently in host cells, because less energy is consumed in disrupting the stem-loops formed by its genomic RNA. Notably, genomes of cellular organisms also have very low CG abundance, suggesting that mutating C/G into A/T occurs universally in all life forms. Moreover, CG is the dinucleotide related to CpG island, mutational hotspot and single nucleotide polymorphism in cellular organisms. The relationship between these features is worthy of further investigations. The outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was listed as a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization. As of 15 June 2020, it has caused more than 7.8 million infection cases and over 430,000 deaths worldwide 1 . Its causative virus (officially named SARS-CoV-2) has a genome of single-strand positive-sense RNA with approximately 30,000 nucleotides 2 . Based on its genome sequence, analyses have been conducted to characterize genomic features and to trace origin of the virus 3,4 . Meanwhile, many reports have been focused on developing efficient methods for detection 5,6 and screening effective drugs for treatment 7,8 against COVID-19. Coronaviruses have the largest RNA genomes among all viruses. The single-strand genomic RNA of coronavirus has a cap-like structure at 5′-UTR (untranslated region) and a poly(A)-tail at 3′-UTR, both of which allow it to assume a structure similar to mRNA of host cells. After being released into cytoplasm of a host cell, the viral RNA is translated immediately to produce viral proteins by using the translation machinery of host cells 9 . The viral RNA is much longer than host mRNAs. Such a long single-strand RNA will form multiple stem-loops through base-pairing between its adjacent segments. These stem-loops present an obstacle to the translation machinery, because they must be disrupted to expose coding information contained in them. The stability of a stem-loop structure is dependent on number of hydrogen bonds formed between bases in the stem part. Because C-G and T-A base-pairs are formed through three and two hydrogen bonds respectively, a viral RNA strand with high number of C and G bases will form more stable stem-loops than that with high number of T and A bases. In order to understand whether translation of coronavirus RNA is greatly affected by base composition, we analysed dinucleotide distribution and RNA stability of twenty-four coronavirus species. We found that open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2 have an extremely low abundance of CG dinucleotide. Moreover, the secondary structure formed by SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is less stable than many other coronaviruses. Therefore, it is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is more efficient in reproduction than other coronaviruses, because less energy is consumed in disrupting the stem-loops formed by its genomic RNA. open

Over 1700 people have been infected since it was first reported in September 2012. Despite great efforts, licensed vaccines or therapeutics against MERS-CoV remain unavailable. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is an important viral antigen known to mediate host-receptor binding and virus entry, as well as induce robust humoral and cell-mediated responses in humans during infection. In this review, we highlight the importance of the S protein in the MERS-CoV life cycle, summarize recent advances in the development of vaccines and therapeutics based on the S protein, and discuss strategies that can be explored to develop new medical countermeasures against MERS-CoV.
2a5b2010e202feb4940c44bec3a77cf5f19cd0bb	Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause a wide range of disease varying from mild cold-like symptoms to complicated pneumonia, severe inflammatory response, and death. 1 Although available data has been limited, recent case reports of concurrent infections with influenza virus, 2 human metapneumovirus (hMPV) 3 and seasonal coronaviruses such as CoV-HKU-1 4 in adults and children with SARS-CoV-2 infection have suggested that coinfection may influence morbidity and mortality. A recent study from Kim et al, 5 found that co-infections were frequent in their patient population in Northern California; more than 20% of 116 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens also contained one or more additional respiratory pathogens, most often rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and non-SARS Coronaviridae. Conversely, 7.5% of their specimens positive for a non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogen were also positive for SARS-CoV-2. 5 In addition, a study from Wuhan examining 8274 patients with 2745 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, revealed that 5.8% of SARS-CoV-2 infected and 18.4% of non-SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had co-infections. 6 To determine whether co-infections with other respiratory pathogens represent a significant subset of SARS-CoV-2 infections in our patient population, we reviewed results from our laboratory, which performs diagnostic testing for 8 inpatient and associated outpatient facilities in the greater New York City metropolitan area. tested 16,408 patients for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR, cobas® 6800 system, RocheDiagnostics); of those, 2,049 were also tested with the multiplex FilmArray® Respiratory Panel (RPPCR2, BioMerieux) or Cepheid Xpert® Xpress Flu/RSV (Flu/RSV). Our findings are notable for high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (54.8 %) during that time period, and very low rates of co-infection with other non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens. Specific data for the detection of other respiratory pathogens in our SARS-CoV-2 positive patients is presented in Table I , and compared to findings for patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 was not detected.

However, our results are in keeping with a recent paper from Spain showing that hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients with pneumonia were infrequently co-infected with other respiratory viruses. 7
578d296ec1f6acc01c08cc5a9861bac6d47ddfda	Virions are thought to contain all the essential proteins that govern virus egress from the host cell and initiation of replication in the target cell. It has been known for some time that influenza virions contain nine viral proteins; however, analyses of other enveloped viruses have revealed that proteins from the host cell can also be detected in virions. To address whether the same is true for influenza virus, we used two complementary mass spectrometry approaches to perform a comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified influenza virus particles. In addition to the aforementioned nine virus-encoded proteins, we detected the presence of 36 host-encoded proteins. These include both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound proteins that can be grouped into several functional categories, such as cytoskeletal proteins, annexins, glycolytic enzymes, and tetraspanins. Interestingly, a significant number of these have also been reported to be present in virions of other virus families. Protease treatment of virions combined with immunoblot analysis was used to verify the presence of the cellular protein and also to determine whether it is located in the core of the influenza virus particle. Immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of membrane-bound host proteins on the influenza virus envelope. The identification of cellular constituents of influenza virions has important implications for understanding the interactions of influenza virus with its host and brings us a step closer to defining the cellular requirements for influenza virus replication. While not all of the host proteins are necessarily incorporated specifically, those that are and are found to have an essential role represent novel targets for antiviral drugs and for attenuation of viruses for vaccine purposes.
f9a7674c9052c8a2db502ec640a9e9cd1d6cef34	Background: China has made substantial progress in tackling its HIV and AIDS epidemic. But the changing patterns of HIV and AIDS incidence based on the longitudinal observation data were rarely studied. Methods: The reporting incidence (RI) and mortality data on HIV and AIDS in China covering 31 provinces from 2004 to 2014 were collected from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center. To decompose the time-series data, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was applied to properly describe the trends of HIV and AIDS incidence. A mathematical model was used to estimate the relative change of incidence among provinces and age groups. Results: A total of 483,010 newly HIV infections and 214,205 AIDS cases were reported between 2004 and 2014 nationwide. HIV infection increased from 13,258 in 2004 (RI 1.02 per 100,000 person years) to 74,048 in 2014 (RI 5.46 per 100,000). The number of AIDS cases increased from 3054 in 2004 (RI 0.23 per 100,000) to 45,145 in 2014 (RI 3.33 per 100,000). The overall relative changes for HIV infection and AIDS incidence were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.13) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.23-1.33), respectively. The relative increase for HIV and AIDS RI was higher in northwest provinces while lower in Henan, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan. The overall relative changes for HIV infection were 1.12 (95% CI 1.11-1.14) in males and 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.13) in females. For AIDS RI, the relative increases were 1.31 (95% CI 1.26-1.36) in males and 1.22 (95% CI 1.17-1.28) in females. The lowest relative increase was detected among young adults, while the largest relative increase (odds ratio [OR] > 1.30) was detected in people aged 55 years or above. Conclusions: HIV and AIDS showed an increasing trend in China from 2004 to 2014, respectively, but the epidemic tended to be under control among provinces and young people that used to have a high HIV and AIDS incidence. Northwest China and older people could be new "hop-spots" for HIV and AIDS risk.
1b866f640fd6093ed5e3b7d2c5c0bc16bf042089	Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) ORF1 encodes the nonstructural polyprotein wherein a role of PCP-domain in ORF1 proteolysis and/or RNA replication still remains contested. A series of ORF1 mutants of HEV-SAR 55 replicon were constructed and tested for viability in S10-3 cells. Six of PCP-'cysteine' (C457A, C459A, C471A, C472A, C481A and C483A) and three 'histidine' (H443L, H497L and H590L) mutants were lethal. Further, a highly conserved 'glycine-triad' (G815-G816-G817) in downstream X-domain, homologous to rubella virus protease-substrate (G1299-G1300-G1301) was identified where two of X-mutants (G816V and G817V) turned lethal. However, all ORF1 sequential nucleotide-mutants conserving the amino acids were viable, which clearly showed post-translational regulation of HEV replication by PCP-and X-domains. Moreover, while vector-expressed ORF1-fusion polyprotein yielded a ∼191 kDa band in vitro, it produced ∼78 and ∼35 kDa fragments ex vivo. Collectively, the indispensability and functional effects of 'PCP-catalytic' and 'X-substrate' residues on HEV replication strongly supported a viral protease.

755c1989eba0605e6111e57f3e551cefdefbe9be	A quantitative COVID-19 model that incorporates hidden asymptomatic patients is developed, and an analytic solution in parametric form is given. The model incorporates the impact of lockdown and resulting spatial migration of population due to announcement of lockdown. A method is presented for estimating the model parameters from real-world data. It is shown that increase of infections slows down and herd immunity is achieved when symptomatic patients are 4-6% of the population for the European countries we studied, when the total infected fraction is between 50-56 %. Finally, a method for estimating the number of asymptomatic patients, who have been the key hidden link in the spread of the infections, is presented.
18b4f00c96ae9b5c267c72e263a9d9b6f11f7521	Novel Corona virus/Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV), and the subsequent disease caused by the virus (coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19), is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in 30-45 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic sequence. RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from actual COVID-19 patients was also tested. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 in both simulated patient samples and clinical specimens. This test was performed in 30-45 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.

1b1e09cef6d76111b87a35a718c28cf86267d2c0	Background: Inadequate hospital cleaning may contribute to cross-transmission of pathogens. It is important to implement effective cleaning for the safe hospital environment. We conducted a three-phase study using human factors engineering (HFE) approach to enhance environmental cleanliness. Methods: This study was conducted using a prospective interventional trial, and 28 (33.3%) of 84 wards in a medical center were sampled. The three-phases included pre-intervention analysis (Phase 1), implementing interventions by HFE principles (Phase 2), and programmatic analysis (Phase 3). The evaluations of terminal cleaning and disinfection were performed using the fluorescent marker, the adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence assay, and the aerobic colony count method simultaneously in all phases. Effective terminal cleaning and disinfection was qualified with the aggregate outcome of the same 10 high-touch surfaces per room. A score for each high-touch surface was recorded, with 0 denoting a fail and 10 denoting a pass by the benchmark of the evaluation method, and the total terminal cleaning and disinfection score (TCD score) was a score out of 100. Results: In each phase, 840 high-touch surfaces were collected from 84 rooms after terminal cleaning and disinfection. After the interventions, the TCD score by the three evaluation methods all showed significant improved. The carriage incidence of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) decreased significantly from 4.1 per 1000 patient-days to 3.6 per 1000 patient-days (P = .03). The HFE approach can improve the thoroughness and the effectiveness of terminal cleaning and disinfection, and resulted in a reduction of patient carriage of MDRO at hospitals. Larger studies are necessary to establish whether such efforts of cleanliness can reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infection.
da84b1de18c2934a0ea6255362c64a6c2e97075d	This article discusses the viscerality of consumption; in particular, consumption-as-eating and consumption-as-spending as a set of heterogeneous, contestatory discourses and practices of identity production and subject formation. To do so, I bring together two intersecting events: the Chinese government's ban on wild animal markets during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and Chinese and European media frenzy over the visit to China by the Spanish football club Real Madrid in the wake of the epidemic. In discussing these events, I pay specific attention to unruly bodies-both human and nonhuman-as consumables and those who consume them. In examining translocal encounters of these unruly bodies, I suggest that, in post-SARS China, discourses and practices of consumption produce emergent socialities that at once refigure racialized Orientalist tropes and conjure up discrepant neoliberal imaginaries of lifestyle and consumer choice.

2e4725949ac016efc6a566edb088a3746109a117	Dependency-based anomaly detection methods detect anomalies by looking at the deviations from the normal probabilistic dependency among variables and are able to discover more subtle and meaningful anomalies. However, with high dimensional data, they face two key challenges. One is how to find the right set of relevant variables for a given variable from the large search space to assess dependency deviation. The other is how to use the dependency to estimate the expected value of a variable accurately. In this paper, we propose the Local Prediction approach to Anomaly Detection (LoPAD) framework to deal with the two challenges simultaneously. Through introducing Markov Blanket into dependencybased anomaly detection, LoPAD decomposes the high dimensional unsupervised anomaly detection problem into local feature selection and prediction problems while achieving better performance and interpretability. The framework enables instantiations with off-the-shelf predictive models for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments have been done on both synthetic and real-world data. The results show that LoPAD outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.
d515d3944ae0e54d6ec0bd57a8bb4bec30f589ad	The present review summarizes up-to-date evidence addressing the frequently discussed clinical controversies regarding the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer patients with viral infections, including AIDS, hepatitis B and C, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, influenza, and COVID-19. In detail, we provide available information on (1) safety regarding the risk of new infections, (2) effects on the outcome of pre-existing infections, (3) whether immunosuppressive drugs used to treat ICI-related adverse events affect the risk of infection or virulence of pre-existing infections, (4) whether the use of vaccines in ICI-treated patients is considered safe, and (5) whether there are beneficial effects of ICIs that even qualify them as a therapeutic approach for these viral infections.

f92be2aecf981993b29cd04b3e25a6fdef1ed4d9	Infiltration and runoff from manured agricultural fields can result in livestock pathogens reaching groundwater and surface waters. Here, we measured the effectiveness of glass wool filters to simultaneously concentrate enteric viruses and bacteria of bovine origin from water. The recovery efficiencies were determined for bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, bovine rotavirus group A, bovine coronavirus, poliovirus Sabin III, toxigenic Escherichia coli ,and Campylobacter jejuni seeded into water with three different turbidity levels (0.5, 215, and 447 NTU). Twenty liters of dechlorinated tap water (pH 7) were seeded with the test organisms, and then passed through a glass wool filter using a peristaltic pump (flow rate = 1 liter min -1 ). Retained organisms were eluted from the filters by passing beef extract-glycine buffer (pH 9.5) in the direction opposite of sample flow. Recovered organisms were enumerated by qPCR except for C. jejuni, which was quantified by culture. Mean recovery efficiencies ranged from 55 to 33 % for the bacteria and 58 to 16 % for the viruses. Using bootstrapping techniques combined with Analysis of Variance, recovery efficiencies were found to differ among the pathogen types tested at the two lowest turbidity levels; however, for a given pathogen type turbidity did not affect recovery except for C. jejuni. Glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for concentrating several waterborne pathogens of bovine origin simultaneously, although recovery may be low for some specific taxa such as bovine viral diarrhea virus 1.
463fe530f1f727668d91c0780fda922c6263ed8d	a gradual increase in on-farm mortality of Dutch veal calves was observed. In 2012, the cattle industry decided that more information was needed on risk factors for mortality in both veal herds and herds of origin to enable implementation of risk mitigating measures. Routinely collected data were available from seven different data sources and contained information from 2.4 million white veal calves that were fattened in the period between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2014. Survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier), multilevel Poisson and multilevel Logistic regression models were applied to analyse the data. Two different models were assembled in which risk factors for veal calf mortality in respectively veal herds and herds of origin were identified. Univariable and multivariable regression techniques were used to detect risk factors significantly associated with mortality of veal calves during the fattening period. During the study period, the mean mortality was 4.9% per production cycle. The probability to die was highest during the first weeks after arrival in the veal herds and declined thereafter. Important risk factors included a veal herds with a higher use of antimicrobials, hair colour as proxy for breed, certain countries of origin, veal herd management with a limited amount of supplied feed and a not having an all-in / all-out system. A higher body weight at arrival in the veal herd was associated with lower mortality as well as veal calves that were fed an above median amount of milk, roughage and concentrates. From the calves that were fattened during the study period, observations of 1.1 million calves originated from the Netherlands and were available to study risk factors for veal calf mortality associated with the herd of origin. Important risk factors included purchase, herds with high mortality rates in the quarter in which the calf was born, fast growth in herd size, high cattle replacement rates and a higher antibiotic use in the quarter of birth. Calves that originated from herds that were certified BVD-free, Salmonella-unsuspected or Paratuberculosis-unsuspected, had a lower odds to die during the subsequent fattening period in a veal herd. Veal calf mortality was influenced by risk factors at the herd of origin as well as at veal herds. Adequate collaboration between the different industries is necessary to optimize veal calf management leading to a reduction in veal calf mortality during the fattening period. (I.M.G.A.

9ec7ce0f8b641dd6479665638bc584dd2c3dddc7	Intestinal/multivisceral transplantation has evolved from an experimental procedure to the treatment of choice for patients with irreversible intestinal failure and serious complications related to long-term parenteral nutrition. Children who are likely to suffer permanent intestinal failure and benefi t from intestinal transplantation include those with a remaining small bowel length of less than 30-40 cm, absence of the ileocecal valve, colonic resection and malabsorptive syndromes. Indications for transplant include frequent severe bouts of catheter associated sepsis, threatened loss of vascular access and the development of liver cirrhosis from cholestasis. Children who are more likely to experience cholestasis from total parenteral nutrition include those who experience persistent hyperbilirubinemia (greater than 6 mg/dl despite enteral nutrition), those with recurrent sepsis and/or bacterial overgrowth and those with minimal tolerance of any enteral feeds in the fi rst few months post resection. The 1 year survival rate after intestinal transplantation has markedly improved over the last several years but long term survival rates have remained unchanged. The improved short term survival rates have led to an increased prevalence of this patient population in intensive care units. Management of intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients is uniquely challenging because of complications arising from the high incidence of transplant rejection and its treatment. In the ICU, the complexity of medical care for the transplant recipient requires a multidisciplinary approach with coordination by an intensivist in collaboration with the transplant surgeon, gastroenterologist, and other specialists.
ee0ae3e80679966a71eaeb8ecefb4ff3970ec4f7	The coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein binds viral RNA to form the ribonucleocapsid and regulate RNA synthesis. The interaction of N protein with viral RNA was investigated using circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance. N protein underwent a conformational change upon binding viral RNA and the data indicated electrostatic interactions were involved in the binding of the protein to RNA. Kinetic analysis suggested the amino-terminal region facilitates long-range non-specific interactions between N protein and viral RNA, thus bringing the RNA into close proximity to N protein allowing specific contacts to form via a 'lure' and 'lock' mechanism.
c649437f7c285ccdb83bc52f752568104175bf13	Background: In experimental studies viral infections have been shown to induce type 2 inflammation in asthmatics, but whether this is a feature of naturally occurring virus-induced asthma exacerbations is unknown. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) released from the airway epithelium in response to damage, has been suggested as a link between viral infection and type 2 inflammation, but the role of TSLP in asthma exacerbations is unknown. Objective: To assess whether type 2 inflammation, as measured by sputum eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), is a feature of naturally occurring virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and whether TSLP is associated with this type 2 inflammation. Methods: Patients presenting to hospital with acute asthma were examined during the exacerbation, and after 4 weeks recovery. The assessments included spirometry, FeNO and induced sputum for differential counts and TSLP mRNA levels. Nasal swabs were collected for viral detection. Results: Sputum eosinophils and FeNO were similar between virus-positive (n ¼ 44) and negative patients (n ¼ 44). In virus-positive patients, TSLP expression was lower at exacerbation than follow-up (p ¼ 0.03). High TSLP at exacerbation was associated with lower sputum eosinophils (p ¼ 0.01) and higher FEV1 (p ¼ 0.03). In virus-positive patients, %-predicted FEV1 negatively correlated with both FeNO and sputum eosinophils (p ¼ 0.02 and p ¼ 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings support that type 2 inflammation is present in patients during virus-induced asthma exacerbations, to the same degree as non-viral exacerbations, and correlate negatively with FEV1. However, in virus-positive patients, high TSLP expression during exacerbation was associated with low sputum eosinophils, suggesting that the effect of TSLP in vivo, in the setting of an asthma exacerbation, might be different than the type 2 inducing effects observed in experimental studies.
e689573213ec5a1cf9686df604c00bb4d51ed4c7	Over 120 inherited primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are known to exist. The genes responsible for many of these diseases have also been identified. Recent advances in diagnostic procedures have enabled these to be identified earlier and appropriately treated. While a number of approaches are available to identify mutations, direct sequencing remains the gold standard. This approach identifies the exact genetic change with substantial precision. We suggest that a sensitive and economical approach to mutation detection could be the direct sequencing of cDNA followed by the confirmatory sequencing of the corresponding exon. While screening techniques such as single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP), heteroduplex analysis (HA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) have proven useful, each has inherent advantages and disadvantages. We discuss these advantages and disadvantages and also discuss the potential of future sequencing technologies such as pyrosequencing, combinatorial sequencing-by-hybridization, multiplex polymerase colony (polony), and resequencing arrays as tools for future mutation detection. In addition we briefly discuss several high-throughput SNP detection technologies.

8b1a03032dca681fbd839727d955fd55a3addb73	Climate and trade policy present serious contemporary challenges for all nations. Developed market economies are struggling with trade policy in the modern era of globalization, and the resulting realignments are straining the post-war international economic order. National emissions pledges under the Paris Agreement appear at present to fall far short of achieving the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cuts that science suggests are needed to remain in a < 2°C world. Merging climate and trade policy could provide developed economies a strategy for limiting global emissions while protecting and promoting their economic competitiveness. Since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, border carbon adjustments (BCAs) that would help protect domestic energy-intensive industry and prevent leakage have been discussed as a mechanism to make unilateral climate mitigation more politically attractive. Especially if implemented non-cooperatively, BCAs open the backdoor to protectionism and retaliation and potentially allow nations to retreat behind static barriers. Developments in international trade policy make this alternative to traditional climate diplomacy more viable today than previously and also increase the chance of climate protectionism. We propose an alternative policy framework-a cooperative sectoral tariff reduction (CSTR)-that would help provide dynamic incentives to improve performance, reduce the chance of BCAs being coopted for protectionist purposes, and create the foundation of a carbon club.
b7e9bb10dd1568b307e62062220d0a1976b8014e	The masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) has been suspected to be the host of a SARS-like CoV virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans. In China, the palm civet lives wild and is farmed, but even though the species is a potential carrier of the virus, its geographic distribution and genetic diversity have never been studied. We report the isolation and characterization of six polymorphic microsatellite markers for P. larvata. To characterize each locus, two farmed masked palm civet populations from Shanxi and Guangxi provinces in China were genotyped. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 15, and the observed heterozygosity for these populations was 47.1 and 68.7%, respectively.
68262326e186aeb77d88c752cc1f50455bf27dce	Vibrio vulnificus is a Gram-negative, curved, obligate halophilic marine bacterium that exclusively exists in coastal seawaters. Previous studies revealed that V. vulnificus is one of the most dangerous foodborne zoonotic pathogens for human beings. However, it remains unknown whether marine mammals can be infected by V. vulnificus. In May 2016, a captive spotted seal (Phoca largha) died due to septicemia induced by V. vulnificus. Upon post-mortem examination, V. vulnificus was isolated, identified, and named as BJ-PH01. Further analysis showed that BJ-PH01 belongs to biotype 1 and the Clinical genotype. Furthermore, we performed an epidemiological investigation of V. vulnificus in six aquariums in northern China. As a result, V. vulnificus was successfully isolated from all investigated aquariums. The positive rates ranged from 20% to 100% in each investigated aquarium. During the investigation, 12 strains of V. vulnificus were isolated, and all 12 isolates were classified into biotype 1. Eleven of the 12 isolates belonged to the Clinical genotype, and one isolate belonged to the Environmental genotype. All 12 isolated V. vulnificus strains showed limited antibiotic resistance. Overall, our work demonstrated that V. vulnificus is frequently distributed in aquariums, thus constituting a threat to captive marine mammals and to public health. epidemiology, Phoca largha, Septicemia, Vibrio vulnificus
519a6a1c3752b5494b85e511a10aa62a2977e04d	Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) play a fundamental role in analysis and design of biochemical systems. They induce continuoustime stochastic systems, whose analysis is a computationally intensive task. We present a tool that implements the recently proposed semiquantitative analysis of CRN. Compared to the proposed theory, the tool implements the analysis so that it is more flexible and more precise. Further, its GUI offers a wide range of visualization procedures that facilitate the interpretation of the analysis results as well as guidance to refine the analysis. Finally, we define and implement a new notion of "mean" simulations, summarizing the typical behaviours of the system in a way directly comparable to standard simulations produced by other tools.
2d0285c90976dfa43d58eca6b7d1d7ef29994fc2	The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome 47 (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective 48 antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the 49 overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent 50 dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited 51 potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In 52 analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found 53 that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts 54 and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP 55 treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the 56 hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time 57 of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 58 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, 59 suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP 60 are needed to validate these therapeutic effects. 61 62
1572b5d59d1775a380929d4fe76c408b4dbb3a58	An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 has now been 26 confirmed globally. In absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control 27 through diagnostic testing and quarantine is critical. Early detection and differential 28 diagnosis of respiratory infections increases the chances for successful control of 29 COVID-19 disease. The nucleic acid RT-PCR test is regarded as the current standard 30 for molecular diagnosis with high sensitivity. However, the highest specificity 31 confirmation target ORF1ab gene is considered to be less sensitive than other targets 32 in clinical application. In addition, a large amount of recent evidence indicates that the 33 initial missed diagnosis of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 and discharged 34 patients with "re-examination positive" may be due to low viral load, and the ability 35 of rapid mutation of coronavirus also increases the rate of false negative results. We 36 aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of different nucleic acid detection kits so as to make 37 recommendations for the selection of validation kit, and amplify the suspicious result 38 to be reportable positive by means of simple continuous amplification, which is of 39 great significance for the prevention and control of the current epidemic and the 40 discharge criteria of low viral load patients. 41
c6a79088aa97469957943d3edb54d6da1c76ceaa	In an earlier article, Gordon Drummond summarized ongoing changes in how statistics are being used in experimental physiology (Drummond, 2020) . He described the near ubiquitous use of the P value, cautioning against declaring an analysis "statistically significant". He mentioned alternative approaches including Bayesian and likelihood approaches. This article focusses on the latter approach although we will first have another look at that P value. Then the likelihood approach will be introduced with a very artificial example that allows us to easily grasp the concept. A more realistic example is then described with associated calculations. A further example using real categorical data is explained, and how it relates to and is superior to the oft used χ 2 test. A final discussion reveals that the likelihood approach, although mathematically and statistically accurate, is poorly supported by literature and training. We have some data, we do a statistical test, we get a P value, we decide there is an effect. Apparently, this is all easy and comes naturally to all of us. This is how we do statistics. But then one asks "What is the P value, and what does it mean?" We would rather avoid that question, after all we know that the smaller it is the more statistically significant it is, right? And if we get a really small P value it's a licence to publish.

This study investigated the ability of cellular analysis of BAL fluid to differentially diagnose bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in adult patients who are admitted to intensive care unit. Methods: BAL fluid cellular analysis was evaluated in 47 adult patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL following less than 24 hours of antimicrobial agent exposure. The abilities of BAL fluid total white blood cell (WBC) counts and differential cell counts to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Bacterial pneumonia (n = 24) and viral pneumonia (n = 23) were frequently associated with neutrophilic pleocytosis in BAL fluid. BAL fluid median total WBC count (2,815/mL vs. 300/mL, P,0.001) and percentage of neutrophils (80.5% vs. 54.0%, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. In ROC curve analysis, BAL fluid total WBC count showed the best discrimination, with an area under the curve of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.750-0.960). BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL had a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 78.3%, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 3.83, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.21. When analyzed in combination with serum procalcitonin or C-reactive protein, sensitivity was 95.8%, specificity was 95.7%, PLR was 8.63, and NLR was 0.07. BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.5 in multiple logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Cellular analysis of BAL fluid can aid early differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in critically ill patients.
d5794d9e687b1087383f2bca0c5beaf31ebc2955	Background: Epidemiological interventions aim to control the spread of infectious disease through various mechanisms, each carrying a different associated cost. Methodology: We describe a flexible statistical framework for generating optimal epidemiological interventions that are designed to minimize the total expected cost of an emerging epidemic while simultaneously propagating uncertainty regarding the underlying disease model parameters through to the decision process. The strategies produced through this framework are adaptive: vaccination schedules are iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory of the epidemic given the current population state and updated parameter estimates. Conclusions: Using simulation studies based on a classic influenza outbreak, we demonstrate the advantages of adaptive interventions over non-adaptive ones, in terms of cost and resource efficiency, and robustness to model misspecification.
0850c64c0da308f2f30ed9f9bca1f6eb4a6423d3	Social conflicts occur frequently during the social transition period and the polarization of public opinion happens occasionally. By introducing the social preference theory, the target of this paper is to reveal the micro-interaction mechanism of public opinion polarization. Firstly, we divide the social preferences of Internet users (network nodes) into three categories: egoistic, altruistic, and fair preferences, and adopt the revenue function to define the benefits obtained by individuals with different preferences among their interaction process so as to analyze their decision-making behaviors driven by the revenue. Secondly, the revenue function is used to judge the exit rules of nodes in a network, and then a dynamic network of spreading public opinion with the node (individual) exit mechanism is built based on a BA scale-free network. Subsequently, the influences of different social preferences, as well as individual revenue on the effect of public opinion polarization, are analyzed through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that (1) Different social preferences demonstrate different influences on the evolution of public opinions, (2) Individuals tend to interact with ones with different preferences, (3) The network with a single preference or a high aggregation is more likely to form public opinion polarization. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by a real case.
25b276f6ffc17770b276f19ee470b644ecb95ea9	We report three new cases of a germline heterozygous gain-of-function missense (p.(Met1141Lys)) mutation in the C2 domain of phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) associated with symptoms consistent with previously described auto-inflammation and phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2)-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (APLAID) syndrome and pediatric common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Functional evaluation showed platelet hyper-reactivity, increased B cell receptor-triggered calcium influx and ERK phosphorylation. Expression of the altered p.(Met1141Lys) variant in a PLCγ2knockout DT40 cell line showed clearly enhanced BCR-triggered influx of external calcium when compared to controltransfected cells. Our results further expand the molecular basis of pediatric CVID and phenotypic spectrum of PLCγ2-related defects. Keywords Germline PLCγ2 mutations . PLCγ2 C2 domain Highlights A hypermorphic missense mutation in the C2 domain of PLCG2 is associated with pediatric CVID
884a470bd6c3ae5be0087630eac77d475cb9186a	Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks have been used to investigate the influence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins on the function of human cells, laying out a deeper understanding of COVID-19 and providing ground for drug repurposing strategies. However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to represent each system's state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as HIV1 and HTLV1.
018b6917080128be434b29c213466c60d01618d3	Growing concern about major threats, including climate change, environmental disasters, and other hazards, is matched with the increased interest and appeal of the concept of urban resilience. Much scholarly attention has focused on how to define urban resilience, in addition to raising questions about its applicability and usefulness. But those debates typically overlook questions of implementation. Implementation is important not only for how cities respond to threats but also because it can influence how urban resilience is perceived, discussed, and understood. The policy literature suggests that implementation is rarely straightforward and has ideological and normative perspectives embedded within it. Building on this literature, this paper argues that urban resilience implementation raises its own conceptual questions for both theory and practice. Further, implementing urban resilience entails its own unique challenges, such as extensive coordination, maintaining adaptability, divergent time horizons, and diverse outcomes. The paper also introduces the idea of resilience resistance as a new challenge for urban resilience. Resistance refers to the condition in which governance systems inherently develop barriers to change, flexibility, and adaptability through implementation. Several aspects of resistance are highlighted, including fatigue, complacency, and overconfidence. However, the implementation process can also have unintended positive effects on a city's capacity to prepare for and respond to shocks.
c58bd707ba0b1923b02caba7ec58da227020f072	Fungal viruses or mycoviruses are widespread in fungi and are believed to be of ancient origin. They have evolved in concert with their hosts and are usually associated with symptomless infections. Mycoviruses are transmitted intracellularly during cell division, sporogenesis and cell fusion, and they lack an extracellular phase to their life cycles. Their natural host ranges are limited to individuals within the same or closely related vegetative compatibility groups. Typically, fungal viruses are isometric particles 25±50 nm in diameter, and possess dsRNA genomes. The best characterized of these belong to the family Totiviridae whose members have simple undivided dsRNA genomes comprised of a coat protein (CP) gene and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) gene. A recently characterized totivirus infecting a ®lamentous fungus was found to be more closely related to protozoan totiviruses than to yeast totiviruses suggesting these viruses existed prior to the divergence of fungi and protozoa. Although the dsRNA viruses at large are polyphyletic, based on RDRP sequence comparisons, the totiviruses are monophyletic. The theory of a cellular self-replicating mRNA as the origin of totiviruses is attractive because of their apparent ancient origin, the close relationships among their RDRPs, genome simplicity and the ability to use host proteins ef®ciently. Mycoviruses with bipartite genomes ( partitiviruses), like the totiviruses, have simple genomes, but the CP and RDRP genes are on separate dsRNA segments. Because of RDRP sequence similarity, the partitiviruses are probably derived from a totivirus ancestor. The mycoviruses with unencapsidated dsRNA-like genomes (hypoviruses) and those with bacilliform ( ) strand RNA genomes (barnaviruses) have more complex genomes and appear to have common ancestry with plant ( ) strand RNA viruses in supergroup 1 with potyvirus and sobemovirus lineages, respectively. The La France isometric virus (LIV), an unclassi®ed virus with multipartite dsRNA genome, is associated with a severe die-back disease of the cultivated mushroom. LIV appears to be of recent origin since it differs from its host in codon usage.
e78d03a31c9e7a1c7a5d81fddfc3fd65eb3239aa	 Males are slightly more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection (M:F ratio 1: 0.8)  Male patients affected by COVID 19 have higher chance to present with a more severe disease  Mortality of COVID-19 is nearly twice as high in males than females  Mechanisms underlying this susceptibility are due to genetic, hormonal and biological factors J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 1 Abstract Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV) has been recently characterized, and soon spread around the world generating a pandemic. It has been suggested that men are more severely affected by the viral disease (COVID-19) than women. Objective: the aim of the present Systematic Literature Review (SRL) and meta-analysis was to analyse the influence of gender on COVID-19 mortality, severity and disease outcomes. A SRL was performed in PubMed and Embase searching terms corresponding to the "PEO" format (Population=adult patients affected with COVID-19, Exposure=gender; Outcome=any available clinical outcomes by gender, including mortality and disease severity), search dates 01/01/2020-31/04/2020. Exclusion criteria were: case reports/series, reviews, commentaries, language other than English. We included full-text original articles. Data about study type, country, patients characteristics were extracted. Study quality was evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). From a total of 950 hits generated by databases search, 85 articles fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected. Results: A random-effect meta-analysis was performed to compare mortality, recovery rates and disease severity in men versus women. Male to female ratio was 1: 0.8. A significant association between male sex and mortality (OR=1.81; 95%CI: 1.25-2.62), as well as a lower chance of recovery in men (OR=0.72; 95% CI: 0.55-0.95). Male patients had a higher odd to present with a severe form of COVID-19 (OR=1.46; 95%CI: 1.10-1.94). Conclusions: male are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection, present with a more severe disease and have a worse prognosis. Further studies are warranted to unravel biological mechanisms underlying these observations.
e1be35b4c835e9b982fe494d2d0b6e3fb1622d2e	The Rho ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme (C3bot) is a bacterial protein toxin devoid of a cell-binding or -translocation domain. Nevertheless, C3 can efficiently enter intact cells, including neurons, but the mechanism of C3 binding and uptake is not yet understood. Previously, we identified the intermediate filament vimentin as an extracellular membranous interaction partner of C3. Our results indicate that the RGD motif of C3 is at least one essential C3 motif for binding to host cells and that integrin is an additional receptor for C3 besides vimentin. . 2 The abbreviations used are: C3, C3 exoenzyme derived from Clostridium botulinum; RGD, Arg-Gly-Asp; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; ANOVA, analysis of variance; aa, amino acid(s).

7c4489a0193aa2dce516373331aeabfd66acbd4a	Transformation in a political system regarding number of parties is a significant phenomenon which creates ample grounds for scholarly discourse. The Pakistani political system witnessed a change in the party politics where it transformed from a two-party system to a three-party system in a relatively short time period. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf emerged on the political scene and after just two elections was able to form a government. Challenging the status quo political forces through organizational mobilization, ideology, counter narrative, and redeeming civil military balance, PTI successfully achieved the systemic transformation in political structure of Pakistan. The change in a complex political fabric was attempted across various spectrums of party dynamics and electoral mechanics both at the federal and provincial legislatures employing diverse strategies. The challenge at hand is the translation of those mechanics of change into political realities and policy orientations while dealing with structural intricacies, domestic compulsions of economy, and external relations. China has less experience dealing with this change in the political system and this new important player in Pakistan's politics. PTI also lacks experience managing external relations which has implications for both the important stakeholders. Undergoing political transition dealing with resistance to change from political actors and managing external relations will define the future of political stability and its impact over China-Pakistan relations.
acee92aa1bfa77bcb9516cbed2ef86751d5bcab5	Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) uses its N-terminal domain (NTD) of the viral spike (S) protein to bind the host receptor mouse carcinoembryonic antigenrelated cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) and mediate virus entry. Our previous crystal structure study of the MHV NTD/mCEACAM1a complex (G. Peng, D. Sun, K. R. Rajashankar, Z. Qian, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 108:10696 -10701, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1104306108) reveals that there are 14 residues in the NTD interacting with the receptor. However, their contribution to receptor binding and virus entry has not been fully investigated. Here we analyzed 13 out of 14 contact residues by mutagenesis and identified I22 as being essential for receptor binding and virus entry. Unexpectedly, we found that G29 was critical for the conformational changes of the S protein triggered by either receptor binding or high pH. Replacement of G29 with A, D, F, K, M, and T, to different extents, caused spontaneous dissociation of S1 from the S protein, resulting in an enhancement of high-pH-triggered receptor-independent syncytium (RIS) formation in HEK293T cells, compared to the wild type (WT). In contrast, replacement of G29 with P, a turn-prone residue with a strict conformation, hindered virus entry and conformational changes of the S protein triggered by either receptor binding or pH 8.0, suggesting that the structural turn around G29 and its flexibility are critical. Finally, stabilization of the NTD by G29P had almost no effect on pHindependent RIS induced by the Y320A mutation in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 subunit, indicating that there might be an absence of cross talk between the NTD and CTD during conformational changes of the S protein. Our study will aid in better understanding the mechanism of how conformational changes of the S protein are triggered. IMPORTANCE Binding of the MHV S protein to the receptor mCEACAM1a triggers conformational changes of S proteins, leading to the formation of a six-helix bundle and viral and cellular membrane fusion. However, the mechanism by which the conformational change of the S protein is initiated after receptor binding has not been determined. In this study, we showed that while replacement of G29, a residue at the edge of the receptor binding interface and the center of the structural turn after the ␤1-sheet of the S protein, with D or T triggered spontaneous conformational changes of the S protein and pH-independent RIS, the G29P mutation significantly impeded the conformational changes of S proteins triggered by either receptor binding or pH 8.0. We reason that this structural turn might be critical for conformational changes of the S protein and that altering this structural turn could initiate conformational changes of the S protein, leading to membrane fusion. KEYWORDS mouse hepatitis virus, S protein conformational change, coronavirus spike glycoprotein, initiation of conformational change, receptor-independent syncytium formation C oronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped plus-stranded RNA viruses that infect humans and animals and cause a variety of diseases, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurotropic diseases (1). Phylogenetically, CoVs are classified into four genera, alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses, and deltacoronaviruses (2). Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a lineage A betacoronavirus and is commonly used as a model to study CoV entry, replication, and pathogenesis. MHV utilizes murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (mCEACAM1) as a receptor (3, 4). CEACAM1 is an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) member and is involved in various functions, including development, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and innate and adaptive immune responses, etc. (5). There are two alleles of the CEACMA1 gene in mouse populations: mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b. Although they share 75% identity in the N-terminal Ig-like domain where the MHV spike (S) protein binds, only mCEACAM1a is an effective receptor for MHV (4, 6, 7). Several critical contact residues for MHV S protein binding are missing in mCEACAM1b, including the critical isoleucine 41 (I41) and arginine 47 (R47) residues (7). The entry of CoV is mediated by the interaction between the receptor and the viral S protein. The S protein is a member of the class I viral fusion proteins. Each monomer of the trimeric S protein is about 180 to 200 kDa and composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. Like most other class I viral fusion proteins, S1 contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), while S2 possesses the fusion machinery, including the fusion peptide, two heptad repeats (HRs), the juxtamembrane domain, and the transmembrane domain ( Fig. 1A ) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Cleavage between S1 and S2 is critical for S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion (also called syncytium formation) (13), and an additional cleavage(s) prior to the fusion peptide is required for virus entry (12, 14, 15) . S1 can be further divided into two subdomains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Depending on the specific coronavirus, the RBD can be located in either the NTD or CTD (Fig.  1A) . While RBDs of all known alphacoronaviruses and most of the known betacoronaviruses are located in the CTD (16-22), MHV uses its NTD to bind mCEACAM1a (23). Our previous structural studies on the NTD/mCEACAM1a complex revealed that the MHV NTD folds like human galectins and that 14 residues on the NTD make direct contacts with mCEACAM1a (Fig. 1B) . However, the contribution of each individual contacting residue in the NTD to receptor binding and virus entry has not been fully analyzed. In this study, we systematically investigated the role of most contacting residues of NTDs in receptor binding and infection and found that R20, I22, N26, and N172 are critical for receptor binding and virus entry. Surprisingly, we found that G29 was critical for conformational changes of the S protein, although it had no influence on receptor binding.
6b5d6183bd8c26b30adbf1f8e21638140a228659	This paper investigates the correlation between the high level of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lethality and the atmospheric pollution in Northern Italy. Indeed, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna are Italian regions with both the highest level of virus lethality in the world and one of Europe's most polluted area. Based on this correlation, this paper analyzes the possible link between pollution and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. We provide evidence that people living in an area with high levels of pollutant are more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and suitable to any infective agent. Moreover, a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus, even in young and healthy subjects. We conclude that the high level of pollution in Northern Italy should be considered an additional co-factor of the high level of lethality recorded in that area.
9f3facde93a5355c473af0fdfd7dc7d044e758aa	COVID-19 often leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). The indications for renal replacement therapy for these patients are those commonly accepted to treat AKI. We describe a continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) protocol for AKI, which aims to provide the best treatment according to the particular patient's and medical personnels' needs in biohazard settings with limited human and technological resources. We designed a CVVHD protocol with a high cut-off (HCO) filter in regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA). The HCO filter in diffusion determines the enhanced cytokines clearance with less filter clotting due to a lower filtration fraction. In our hospital, at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, we treated seven COVID-19 patients with AKI stage 2 and 3 and recorded the circuit lifespan and the number of interventions on monitors. CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources. Although the data come from a very small cohort, our protocol seems related to a low mortality.
dd72594d461e96c9bb65329cec0fe7b7c4af1be9	Bats harbor many pathogens of veterinary and human health concern, including several emerging and reemerging viruses such as lyssaviruses, fi loviruses, henipaviruses, and SARS-like coronaviruses. Despite immune responses to these viruses, many bats remain infected without disease and likely shed virus to other bats and mammals. Little is known about bat immune systems or how the immune responses of bats control infections. The recent characterization of genome and transcriptome sequences of several bat species suggests they are similar to other mammals. These data indicate that bats possess orthologous genes, antibodies, and cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses as do other mammals, but bats likely evolved unique mechanisms for controlling viruses that cause disease in other species. It is unclear how these diseases affect bat ecology, and thus, a greater understanding of immunology and infection is needed to understand health impact on bats.
49ddbf7c497973ebf3d8401bb2ee28e21e802e2d	Background: Thrombocytopaenia is the most frequent malaria-associated haematologic alteration observed with all five Plasmodium parasites causing disease in humans. Although not included in the World Health Organization criteria for severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, severe thrombocytopaenia has been increasingly mentioned as an indicator of P. vivax malaria severity. Case: Here, it is described a case of imported P. vivax malaria in a 37-year old man from Pakistan who presented with severe thrombocytopaenia (5 × 10 9 /L). He was admitted to the intensive care unit and initially treated with a 1-day course of intravenous quinine followed by oral chloroquine and primaquine. The patient's platelet count increased as early as 4 hours after treatment inception and the clinical course was favourable and uneventful. Discussion: This case report, along with a review of published cases focusing on the relationship between thrombocytopaenia and severe P. vivax malaria, suggests that the prognostic role of severe thrombocytopaenia is ambiguous in absence of severe haemorraghic complications and its use as diagnostic criterion of malaria severity may lead to overestimation of severe P. vivax malaria cases. Due to the lack of high quality studies it is at present unclear if severe thrombocytopaenia in the setting of P. vivax malaria should be considered indicative of severe malaria.
3a68b79bd192af03c65de40574c22b18b0fa5c53	Persons with disabilities (PWDs) living in cities during the COVID-19 pandemic response may be four times more likely to be injured or die than non-disabled persons, not because of their "vulnerable" position but because urban health policy, planning and practice has not considered their needs. In this article, the adverse health impacts on PWDs during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the "everyday emergencies" in cities for PWDs and that these can be avoided through more inclusive community planning, a wholeof-government commitment to equal access, and implementation of universal design strategies. Importantly, COVID-19 can place PWDs at a higher risk of infection since some may already have compromised immune and respiratory systems and policy responses, such as social distancing, can lead to life-threatening disruptions in care for those that rely on home heath or personal assistants. Living in cities may already present healthdamaging challenges for PWDs, such as through lack of access to services and employment, physical barriers on streets and transportation, and smart-city technologies that are not made universally accessible. We suggest that the current pandemic be viewed as an opportunity for significant urban health reforms on the scale of the sanitary and governance reforms that followed ninetieth century urban epidemics. This perspective offers insights for ensuring the twenty-first century response to COVID-19 focuses on promoting more inclusive and healthy cities for all.
5ee95465ec6ed679756bab631f8847b5e0cc92ce	Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection is associated with a high case-fatality rate, and the potential pandemic spread of the virus is a public health concern. The spike protein of MERS-CoV (MERS-S) facilitates viral entry into host cells, which depends on activation of MERS-S by cellular proteases. Proteolytic activation of MERS-S during viral uptake into target cells has been demonstrated. However, it is unclear whether MERS-S is also cleaved during S protein synthesis in infected cells and whether cleavage is required for MERS-CoV infectivity. Here, we show that MERS-S is processed by proprotein convertases in MERS-S-transfected and MERS-CoV-infected cells and that several RXXR motifs located at the border between the surface and transmembrane subunit of MERS-S are required for efficient proteolysis. However, blockade of proprotein convertases did not impact MERS-S-dependent transduction of target cells expressing high amounts of the viral receptor, DPP4, and did not modulate MERS-CoV infectivity. These results show that MERS-S is a substrate for proprotein convertases and demonstrate that processing by these enzymes is dispensable for S protein activation. Efforts to inhibit MERS-CoV infection by targeting host cell proteases should therefore focus on enzymes that process MERS-S during viral uptake into target cells.
dd4dcb38b62bd70f99436636e09c2cba0bac5c07	Purpose: To investigate the literature on the presence of COVID-19 virus in urine of infected patients and evaluate the attributes and clinical significance of COVID-19 in urine including probability of infection transmission through urine. Data sources: A systematic review of literature from December 2019 to 6 th May 2020 was conducted on Pubmed, google scholar, ovid, scopus and ISI web of science. Study eligibility criteria: Studies which investigated urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 in infected patients were included. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two reviewers selected relative studies and performed quality assessment of individual studies. Meta-analysis was performed the pooled case reports and case series. Fixed-effects model was used for analysis as no significant heterogeneity was observed between studies. Results: Thirty three studies were finally included in the systematic review including 12 case reports, 20 case series, and one cohort. Urinary samples from 430 patients were investigated. Ten studies reported the presence of COVID-19 in urinary samples from 16 patients. The rate of COVID-19 presence in urinary samples was 3.7%. Urinary viral load was low in most reports. The presence of virus in urine was not related to the disease course of the illness. Urinary COVID-19 was mostly detected from patients with moderate to severe disease (13 pts) but was also isolated from two children (one neonate and one 7 year-old girl) and one adult with mild disease. The pathogenicity of virus isolated from urine has been demonstrated in cell culture media in one study. Conclusions: This review highlights the low frequency of COVID-19 presence in urine of infected individuals and the potential of isolated virus for cytopathic effects. Therefore the probability of infection transmission through urine can be suggested. Caution must be exerted when dealing with urine of patients infected with COVID-19 including medical interventions like endoscopy and urethral catheterization.

Caution must be exerted when dealing with urine of patients infected with COVID-19 including medical interventions like endoscopy and urethral catheterization.
246d1372657ab63d6f10a57907fcda07c1ddbc3a	A majority of emerging infectious diseases are of zoonotic origin. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has been employed to identify uncommon and novel infectious etiologies and characterize virus diversity in human, animal, and environmental samples. Here, we systematically reviewed studies that performed viral mNGS in common livestock (cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs). We identified 2481 records and 120 records were ultimately included after a first and second screening. Pigs were the most frequently studied livestock and the virus diversity found in samples from poultry was the highest. Known animal viruses, zoonotic viruses, and novel viruses were reported in available literature, demonstrating the capacity of mNGS to identify both known and novel viruses. However, the coverage of metagenomic studies was patchy, with few data on the virome of small ruminants and respiratory virome of studied livestock. Essential metadata such as age of livestock and farm types were rarely mentioned in available literature, and only 10.8% of the datasets were publicly available. Developing a deeper understanding of livestock virome is crucial for detection of potential zoonotic and animal pathogens and One Health preparedness. Metagenomic studies can provide this background but only when combined with essential metadata and following the "FAIR" (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Viruses 2020, 12, 107 2 of 22 flocks and wild birds, suggesting that pre-existing biosecurity measurements could not keep up with the rate of livestock intensification [16] . In 2007-2010, a large-scale Q fever outbreak was reported in the Netherlands, affecting more than 3500 human cases and resulting in a huge economic loss [17, 18] . A steep increase in the number of goat farms most likely was the driver for the increased prevalence of Coxiella burnetii infections, with animal abortion waves that had gone unnoticed. The policy of voluntary reporting abortion outbreaks to the Animal Health Service hindered the timely detection of the circulation of Q fever, and therefore early interventions. These examples indicate that zoonotic risks in the livestock industry should be carefully managed and adapted to livestock intensification. The One Health approach has been coined for advocating collaboration between multiple stakeholders including veterinarians, clinicians, epidemiologists, virologists, microbiologists, ecologists, and policy makers to prevent and control EIDs through the human-animal-environment interface [19] . Surveillance of livestock and the surrounding environment is a hallmark of early detection but is currently targeted to known risks. Advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and rapid development of bioinformatics and computational tools offer new opportunities for EID surveillance in quality and in scale. Particularly, metagenomic NGS (mNGS) allows unbiased detection of all microbes and viruses in a sample, showing potential for timely detection of rare or novel infectious etiologies, as well as for surveillance of foodborne and waterborne viruses [20] [21] [22][23][24][25][26]. However, the use of mNGS as a potential surveillance tool requires a deeper understanding of what is "normal" diversity in humans [27], as well as wildlife [28,29] and farm animals [30]. Characterizing species-specific metagenomes could potentially be used to provide a surveillance baseline for early detection and for tracking of movements of pathogens across different hosts, and has been promoted by projects like the global virome project [31]. However, for such applications, detailed background is needed regarding coverage, representativeness, and biases in the study designs. Here, we conduct a systematic review to identify available literature that performed viral mNGS in common farm animals including cattle, small ruminants (goats and sheep), poultry, and pigs. We reviewed the data and metadata availability and quality of these studies. We further summarized reported viromes of common farm animals in order to translate these efforts as background virus diversity profiles of common farm animals to guide preparedness of diseases at the livestock-human interface.
a2374240f305e13d73be2fd5523bd84167f2f509	Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not fully understood phenomenon. Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at different latitudes on Earth. Such models take into account known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.

In a mass screening involving 4174 out of about 4550 total inhabits, 29 significant age-related differences in anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence were found, with the 30 lowest prevalence in the youngest inhabitants. 31 32 Background and Methods 34
ee2aef2bbd495fe25b28e4bf26d43ae0eb318211	A new coronavirus outbreak emerged on the 31st of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, causing commotion among the medical community and the rest of the world. This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high (approximately 2---3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of protocols to stop its spread. This pathogen has the potential to become a pandemic. It is therefore vital to follow the personal care recommendations issued by the World Health Organization.
92921d79c02bd4c83eac4ebe37d1558e4458dc87	We present selected topics of population genetics and molecular phylogeny. As several excellent review articles have been published and generally focus on European and American scientists, here, we emphasize contributions by Japanese researchers. Our review may also be seen as a belated 50-year celebration of Motoo Kimura's early seminal paper on the molecular clock, published in 1968.
4c0a84d9d35e76db288afca33c1f63c27d436328	Due to their overall immunocompromised state, lung transplant recipients (LTRs) are at increased risk for the development of viral respiratory infections compared to the general population. Such respiratory infections often lead to poor transplant outcomes. We performed a systematic review of the last 30 years of medical literature to summarize the impact of specific respiratory viruses on LTRs. After screening 2,150 articles for potential inclusion, 39 manuscripts were chosen for final review. We found evidence for an association of respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and influenza viruses with increased morbidity following transplant. Through the literature search, we also documented associations of RSV and adenovirus infections with increased mortality among LTRs. We posit that the medical literature supports aggressive surveillance for respiratory viruses among this population.

We access those information analytically and numerically using a logistic model. It is shown, using diferent data from The Brazilian Ministry of Health (MS), The World Health Organization -WHO, and The Niteroi Health Foundation (FMS), the contaminated population ramping-up curves, the population inflection, the population saturation -plateau regime, and also the time related to these population evolution regimes. Based on the simulations, approaches are proposed at this more advanced phase of the pandemic, which might generate effectiveness at the actions of society in general, in a way that those actions could generate effective and efficient results, and this means a more organized war against this pandemic, a better way .

5c7ffda5fa88b655f22c3a5ab0bcfc6d659ac33e	Bats are important reservoir hosts for emerging viruses, including coronaviruses that cause diseases in people. Although there have been several studies on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans and surrogate animals, there is little information on the interactions of these viruses with their natural bat hosts. We detected a coronavirus in the intestines of 53/174 hibernating little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), as well as in the lungs of some of these individuals. Interestingly, the presence of the virus was not accompanied by overt inflammation. Viral RNA amplified from little brown bats in this study appeared to be from two distinct clades. The sequences in clade 1 were very similar to the archived sequence derived from little brown bats and the sequences from clade 2 were more closely related to the archived sequence from big brown bats. This suggests that two closely related coronaviruses may circulate in little brown bats. Sequence variation among coronavirus detected from individual bats suggested that infection occurred prior to hibernation, and that the virus persisted for up to 4 months of hibernation in the laboratory. Based on the sequence of its genome, the coronavirus was placed in the Alphacoronavirus genus, along with some human coronaviruses, bat viruses and the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus. The detection and identification of an apparently persistent coronavirus in a local bat species creates opportunities to understand the dynamics of coronavirus circulation in bat populations.

ebf468257d5815952dc1f1bbdce2fd8e0aac085c	This paper investigates if firms under high institutional pressure donate more to disaster relief than firms under lower institutional pressure. By taking Chinese listed companies' donations to May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake as the sample, this research finds that large firms and firms who have political ties donate a significant more to disaster relief than smaller firms and firms who do not have political ties. But the findings indicate that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) donate no more than non SOEs, and service companies donate significantly less than non-service companies. The results of this research partly support the institutional point of view of corporate philanthropy. Firms under high institutional pressure are more likely to donate more than firms facing lower institutional pressure.
2ec38198b8382246c22ad30fdab26ca53f32ef1c	Technology has become a very important part of everyone's life. Everyone from the age of 5 to 65 years is on social media every day with billions of users sending messages, sharing information, comments, and the like [1] . With the advancement in information technology, social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn are available for the users to interact with families, colleagues, and friends. As a result, social activities are shifting from real things to virtual machines [2] . Analyzing the behavior of individuals from social networking sites is a complex task because there are several methods used. By gathering information from different resources and then analyzing that information, the behavior of the users can be examined. In this research, we have collected different studies about assessing human behavior with the help of social media and compared them according to the different methods used by different authors [3] . To know the personal preference of the users on the social media is a very important task for businesses [4] . Companies can then target those interested customers who are active on the social media in related areas. By gathering information about user behavior pattern, the preferences of the individuals can be identified [5] . Different researchers have found various methods to collect information about human intentions. In this research, our main aim is to analyze how information is analyzed in social media and how this information is useful. This research is very useful as methods to detect human behavior that has been analyzed on different social media [6] . In this research, 30 research papers have been collected from different social media providers such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. After analyzing the data given in these papers, the different methods used were examined. In particular, the behavior of users was analyzed from aspects such as likes, comment, and shares from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter [7] . The first section provides the material and methods used by the 30 authors to predict the behavior of social media users. This section included data collection, data inclusion Social Network Analytics. https://doi.
574f7b4ebf2ce9ad15391861ee9d4c9501811d60	Vaccines against COVID-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. However, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of COVID-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. This Outlook synthesizes current laboratory findings to define which parts of the immune system help with recovery from and protection against the virus and which can lead to adverse outcomes. To inform our understanding, we analyze research about the immune mechanisms implicated in SARS-CoV, from the 2003 outbreak, and SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The impact of how innate immunity, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity play a role in a harmful versus helpful response is discussed, establishing principles to guide the development and evaluation of a safe but effective COVID-19 vaccine. The principles derived include (i) targeting the appropriate specificity and effector function of the humoral response, (ii) eliciting a T cell response, especially a cytotoxic T cell response, to achieve safe, yet effective, immune protection from COVID-19, and (iii) monitoring for the possibility of acute lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination in preclinical and clinical studies. These principles can not only guide efforts toward a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, but also the development of effective vaccines for viral pandemics to come. Outlook
0df4acedd15922e72eb97cc24fcc7c77f866aa11	Infection of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induced a strong anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibody response. However, the pathophysiological significance of the anti-N antibodies in SARS pathogenesis is largely unknown. To profile the anti-N antibodies, a phage-displayed scFv library was prepared from mice immunized with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cell lysate. Specific anti-N scFvs were isolated by panning against a recombinant nucleocapsid protein and reactivity was confirmed with phage-ELISA. Sequence analysis indicated that two of the isolated anti-N scFv clones were identical and displayed a high homology with an scFv specific for interleukin 11 (IL-11), an anti-inflammatory cytokine derived from bone marrow stroma cells. In a neutralization assay, IL-11-induced STAT 3 phosphorylation in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells was completely suppressed by the anti-N scFv clone L9N01.
34d847dd92d06c3d409d1d392cc5fc52db35b807	SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic agent of COVID-19, employs angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as its cell entry receptor. Clinical data reveal that in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infects the lung, leading to a frequently lethal triad of respiratory insufficiency, acute cardiovascular failure, and coagulopathy. Physiologically, ACE2 plays a role in the regulation of three systems that could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19: the kinin-kallikrein system, resulting in acute lung inflammatory edema; the renin-angiotensin system, promoting cardiovascular instability; and the coagulation system, leading to thromboembolism. Here we analyzed ~130,000 human lung single-cell transcriptomes and show that key elements of the kinin-kallikrein, renin-angiotensin and coagulation systems are co-expressed with ACE2 in alveolar cells, which could explain how changes in ACE2 promoted by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry result in the development of the three most severe clinical components of COVID-19.
bc0859f34bfb9b1e75220c42362947892dfdb6f7	P rotein-protein interactions play a central role in biological processes and thus are an appeahng target for innovative drug design and development. They can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, peptides and peptidomimetics, which represent an alternative to protein therapeutics that carry many disadvantages. In this chapter, I describe specific protein-protein interactions suggested by a novel model of immune signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoOLigomerization (SCHOOL) model, to be critical for cell activation mediated by multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs) expressed on different cells of the hematopoietic system. Unraveling a long-standing mystery of MIRR triggering and transmembrane signaling, the SCHOOL model reveals the intrareceptor transmembrane interactions and interreceptor cytoplasmic homointeractions as universal therapeutic targets for a diverse variety of disorders mediated by immune cells. Further, assuming that the general principles underlying MIRR-mediated transmembrane signaling mechanisms are similar, the SCHOOL model can be appHed to any particular receptor of the MIRR family. Thus, an important application of the SCHOOL model is that global therapeutic strategies targeting key protein-protein interactions involved in MIRR triggering and transmembrane signal transduction may be used to treat a diverse set of immune-mediated diseases. This assumes that clinical knowledge and therapeutic strategies can be transferred between seemingly disparate disorders, such as T-cell-mediated skin diseases and platelet disorders, or combined to develop novel pharmacological approaches. Intriguingly, the SCHOOL model unravels the molecular mechanisms underlying ability of different human viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus to modulate and/or escape the host immune response. It also demonstrates how the lessons learned firom viral pathogenesis can be used practically for rational drug design. Application of this model to platelet collagen receptor signaling has already led to the development of a novel concept of platelet inhibition and the invention of new platelet inhibitors, thus proving the suggested hypothesis and highhghting the importance and broad perspectives of the SCHOOL model in the development of new targeting strategies.
bbc89603600968ee09dd4b38c91616f83f7e0bba	West Nile virus (WNV) is a blood-borne pathogen that causes systemic infections and serious neurological disease in human and animals. The most common route of infection is mosquito bites and therefore, the virus must cross a number of polarized cell layers to gain access to organ tissue and the central nervous system. Resistance to trans-cellular movement of macromolecules between epithelial and endothelial cells is mediated by tight junction complexes. While a number of recent studies have documented that WNV infection negatively impacts the barrier function of tight junctions, the intracellular mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. In the present study, we report that endocytosis of a subset of tight junction membrane proteins including claudin-1 and JAM-1 occurs in WNV infected epithelial and endothelial cells. This process, which ultimately results in lysosomal degradation of the proteins, is dependent on the GTPase dynamin and microtubule-based transport. Finally, infection of polarized cells with the related flavivirus, Dengue virus-2, did not result in significant loss of tight junction membrane proteins. These results suggest that neurotropic flaviviruses such as WNV modulate the host cell environment differently than hemorrhagic flaviviruses and thus may have implications for understanding the molecular basis for neuroinvasion.
9dd88265053594d2736a884a8b972b6ae94218c5	Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel infectious agent causing severe respiratory disease and death in humans, was first described in 2012. Antibodies directed against the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein are thought to play a major role in controlling MERS-CoV infection and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity. In contrast, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of MERS-CoV that are recognized by CD8+ T cells. In this study, the highly conserved MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein served as a target immunogen to elicit MERS-CoV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for generating MVA-MERS-N expressing recombinant N protein. Overlapping peptides spanning the whole MERS-CoV N polypeptide were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in BALB/c mice immunized with MVA-MERS-N. We have identified a H2-d restricted decamer peptide epitope in the MERS-N protein with CD8+ T cell antigenicity. The identification of this epitope, and the availability of the MVA-MERS-N candidate vaccine, will help to evaluate MERS-N-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of MERS-CoV infection. At present, there is still relatively little known about the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. The highest incidence of severe disease is observed in elderly and immunocompromised individuals [11] . Those at general risk for infections are health care workers and people in close contact with dromedary camels [12, 13] . These groups are therefore considered relevant target populations for prophylactic vaccination against MERS-CoV infection and prevention of MERS. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) have listed MERS as priority target for vaccine development [14] . However, so far, no candidate vaccines have proceeded beyond phase I/IIa clinical testing [15] . One of these candidate vaccines is based on Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested and replication-deficient vaccinia virus serving as an advanced viral vector platform for the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer (for review see [16] ). In that context, we still know relatively little about the correlates of vaccine induced protection against MERS-CoV. It is well-known that virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) correlate with protective immunity against coronavirus infections in general [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since the S protein is present on the cell surface, S protein is considered as the major antigen to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and as a key immunogen for the development of MERS-CoV candidate vaccines [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, based on current knowledge from the biology of β-coronaviruses, we hypothesize that also other viral proteins warrant consideration as immunogens and targets of virus-specific antibodies and T cells. Among those, the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is produced at high levels in infected cells and has been proposed as useful candidate protein for clinical diagnosis [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The coronavirus N proteins have been associated with multiple functions in the virus life cycle including the regulation of viral RNA synthesis, the packaging of the viral RNA in helical nucleocapsids, and in virion assembly through interaction with the viral M protein [31] [32] [33] [34] . Furthermore, several reports suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein functions as an immune evasion protein and an antagonist of the host interferon response [35] [36] [37] . Recently, the overexpression of MERS-CoV N in human A549 cells was found to be linked to an up-regulation of antiviral host gene expression including the synthesis of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 [38] . Despite this possible immune modulatory activity, SARS-CoV N-specific immune responses are reported to be long-lived and more broadly reactive when compared to SARS-CoV S-specific immunity [39] . Likewise, we were curious as to the suitability of the MERS-CoV N protein to serve as a vaccine antigen. The N protein is not present on the surface of MERS-CoV particles nor is it predicted to be expressed on the surface membrane of MVA infected cells. From this we hypothesized that the most relevant part of MERS-CoV N-specific immunity is based on CD8+ T cell responses relying on the processing and presentation of intracellular antigens. Currently, there is little information about MERS-CoV N-specific immune responses including the in vivo induction of N-specific cellular immunity. In this study, we investigated the synthesis and delivery of the MERS-CoV N protein as a privileged antigen by a MVA vector virus. The recombinant MVA expressing a synthetic gene sequence of full-length MERS-CoV N (MVA-MERS-N) proved genetically stable and fully replication-competent in chicken embryo fibroblasts, an established cell substrate for MVA vaccine manufacturing. Upon in vitro infection, MVA-MERS-N produced high amounts of the heterologous protein that were detectable with MERS-CoV N-specific antibodies. Furthermore, MVA-MERS-N was tested as an experimental vaccine in BALB/c mice and elicited MERS-CoV N-specific interferon γ (IFN-γ)-producing CD8+ T cells. Using peptide library covering the whole MERS-CoV N polypeptide, we identified new H2-d restricted peptide epitopes of MERS-CoV N in BALB/c mice. This data will be highly relevant for further assessment of N antigen-specific immune responses in the well-established MERS-CoV-BALB/c mouse immunization/challenge model [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .
c53bd19041d591f49de0a8bb1d196cf146aa2daf	Liquorice root has been used in Europe since prehistoric times, and is well documented in written form starting with the ancient Greeks. In this review we compare the independent development of medical uses of this botanical drug in several ancient cultures, attempting to show the rationality of specific indications across different ethnic groups with different cultural backgrounds. Identical specific indications in different cultures highlight universally reproducible therapeutic effects that are beyond those of a mere placebo. In the first part of the review, historical sources dealing with liquorice (Scythian, Greek, Roman, and from the Middle Ages in Germany, Italy, Spain, England) have been considered. In the second part, the historical records of diseases treated with liquorice have been presented. Finally, a comparison between traditional use in and outside Europe, with the most important recent scientific studies concerning its use, is presented.
40071a90ffd28360268e1e4a985ffa99e19fcd14	Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be developing into a planetary-scale mental health experiment, undermining the foundations of our being human, obliging us to keep physically apart from one another, and inducing us to see other people as a potential threat. Methods: In the world of pediatric oncology, we have found ourselves up against new challenges. In this article, we discuss the difficulties found in conducting psychological support sessions while complying with physical distancing rules, as well as wearing protective face masks, and even gloves; or while using modern remote communication telecommunications. Results: The classic reasons behind requests for psychological support have been compounded by other, novel problems, such as: fewer relational resources for families at home, less chance to socialize, hospital stays with only one parent, the suspension of all teaching and group activities on the ward, economic difficulties caused by the pandemic, the rising levels of family conflictuality and generalized anxiety. Conclusions: It is essential to find new solutions that can be promptly implemented, reconfiguring the way we humanize our hospital wards. COVID-19, pediatric oncology, psychological support, remote communication, social distancing The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown seems to be developing into a planetary-scale mental health experiment, undermining the very foundations of our being human, launching an attack on our thoughts, obliging us to keep physically apart from one another, and inducing us to see other people as a potential threat.
561211ed199b50721dd36afce10acd2ded4f3f0e	Persistence is a crucial trait for learners. However, a common issue in mastery learning is that persistence is not always productive, a construct termed wheel-spinning. In this paper, we extend on prior work to develop wheel-spinning detectors in the ASSISTments learning system that distinguish between non-persistence, productive persistence and wheel-spinning. To understand how quickly we can detect each state, we use data from different numbers of practice opportunities and compare model performance across student-problem set pairs. We identify that a model constructed using data from the first nine practice opportunities outperforms models using less practice data. However, it is possible to differentiate students who will eventually wheel-spin from learners who will persist productively using data from only the first three opportunities. Wheel-spinning can be differentiated from non-persistence from the first five opportunities, and non-persistence can be differentiated from productive persistence from the first seven opportunities. These results show that early differentiation between wheel-spinning and productive persistence is feasible. These detectors relied upon hint requests, the correctness of prior opportunities, and the amount of practice and time on the skill. Identifying predictive features offer insights into the impact of in-system behaviors on wheel-spinning and guide the system design.
d6ad8c9b0086b05f7436e6eed4831c0b722c50ef	Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has infected millions with more than 181,000 fatal cases as of 22 nd April 2020. Currently, there are no specific COVID-19 therapies. Most patients depend on mechanical ventilation. Current COVID-19 data clearly highlight that cytokine storm and activated immune cell migration to the lungs characterize the early immune response to COVID-19 that causes severe lung damage and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In view of uncertainty associated with immunosuppressive treatments such as corticosteroids and their possible secondary effects, including risks of secondary infections, we suggest immunotherapies as an adjunct therapy in severe COVID-19 cases. Such immunotherapies based on inflammatory cytokine neutralization, immunomodulation and passive viral neutralization, not only reduce inflammation, inflammation-associated lung damage, or viral load, but could also prevent intensive care unit hospitalization and dependency on mechanical ventilation both of which are limited resources.
629efb142162349b5413d92398ecf4d4c63e9d23	It has been known for a few decades that transcripts can be marked by dozens of different modifications. Yet, we are just at the beginning of charting these marks and understanding their functional impact. High-quality methods were developed for the profiling of some of these marks, and approaches to finely study their impact on specific phases of the RNA life-cycle are available, including RNA metabolic labeling. Thanks to these improvements, the most abundant marks, including N 6 -methyladenosine, are emerging as important determinants of the fate of marked RNAs. However, we still lack approaches to directly study how the set of marks for a given RNA molecule shape its fate. In this perspective, we first review current leading approaches in the field. Then, we propose an experimental and computational setup, based on direct RNA sequencing and mathematical modeling, to decipher the functional consequences of RNA modifications on the fate of individual RNA molecules and isoforms.
58d1eab77cf8a541864220d8b3130336881891b7	Ischemic cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is a relatively common condition in dogs but infrequent in cats, with acute or peracute onset of non-progressive neurological signs. Cerebellar artery infarction appears to be very uncommon in cats, with only two cases reported affecting the rostral cerebellar artery (RCA). This study aims to report for the first time the neurological signs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and outcome in three cats diagnosed with presumed caudal cerebellar artery (CCA) infarction. Unique presentation of vestibular signs associated with CCA in three cats and similarities between dogs and humans are discussed.
38507bc4d3aa16227b8d6408fd56446dc6432e25	Integrating risk communication and community engagement into the national public health emergency response is crucial. Considering the difficulties and challenges faced by China in the prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and based on interim guidelines from the World Health Organization, this article makes several recommendations addressing the outbreak in China. These include improvements in the internal governmental risk communication systems, enhancing the coordination between internal and partner governmental emergency management, and promoting public communication in response to societal concerns. Regarding these recommendations, we emphasize community engagement in joint prevention and control, confronting uncertainty and countering rumors effectively, and strengthening international cooperation and evidence-based decision making for prevention and control measures.
2b2acb39556c4efda3e4729c3718f2034579428b	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and sometimes a lethal disease, which spread over five continents in 2002 -2003. Laboratory analysis showed that the etiologic agent for SARS is a new type of coronavirus. Currently, there is no specific treatment for this disease. RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered antiviral mechanism in plant and animal cells that induces a specific degradation of double-stranded RNA. Here, we provide evidences that RNAi targeting at coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmids can specifically inhibit expression of extraneous coronavirus RDRP in 293 and HeLa cells. Moreover, this construct significantly reduced the plaque formation of SARS coronaviruses in Vero-E6 cells. The data may suggest a new approach for treatment of SARS patients. D 2004 Elsevier Inc.

ffb5e6ca7dd285d1a863ba891be5e900c480470c	The 2019 Novel Coronavirus has caused an acute shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) globally as well as shortage in the ability to test PPE such as respirator fit testing. This limits not only the ability to fit PPE to medical practitioners, but also the ability to rapidly prototype and produce alternative sources of PPE as it is difficult to validate fit. At the George Washington University, we evaluated an easily sourced method of qualitative fit testing using a nebulizer or "atomizer" and a sodium saccharin solution in water. If aerosolized saccharin entered candidate masks due to poor fit or inadequate filtration, then a sweet taste was detected in the mouth of the user. This method was tested against previously fit tested Milwaukee N95 and 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator as a positive control. A Chinese sourced KN95, cotton cloth material, and surgical mask were tested as other masks of interest. Sensitivity testing was done with no mask prior to fit test. A sweet taste was detected for both the surgical mask and cotton cloth, demonstrating a lack of seal. However, there was no sweet taste detected for the Milwaukee N95, 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator, or Chinese KN95. These results demonstrate this could be a valuable methodology for rapid prototyping, evaluation, and validation of fit in a non-clinical environment for use in creation of PPE. This method should be not be used without confirmation in a formal qualitative or quantitative fit test but can be used to preserve those resources until developers are confident that potential new N95 comparable respirators will pass. We strongly suggest validation of masks and respirators with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) approved fit testing prior to use in a clinical environment.

Children aged from 6 months to 3 years were those most commonly infected. Rotavirus infections were most common during winter with only a few sporadic cases during summer. A possible pathogen was detected in 59% of patients examined.
1aa1ceba1b4b3fb638e55bf180727dabff07353c	The COVID-19 pandemic exerted an adverse influence on the global education system, especially since starting school lockdown. The growth of teacher unemployment figures climbed doubledigit and spawned these unexpected sequels. For instance, while native teachers seemed indisposed to leave the profession with the aim of seeking another more profited and seasonal jobs, many ex-pat teachers presented themselves with moving or stayed dilemma in the way the government salvaged their situation. In preference with the ex-pat teacher's case, we elucidated further throughout an e-survey in the International Baccalaureate community on Facebook from 4 to 11 April 2020 for 18,000 ex-pat teachers, who are teaching at Southeast Asia. This dataset includes 307 responses of ex-pat teachers who are staying in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia during the pandemic. The dataset comprises (i) Survey partakers' Demographics; (ii) Ex-pat teachers' perceptions in the relation of national, regional and school plans were afoot to the pandemic; (iii) The degree of attachment of ex-pat teacher to their current society, the ex-pat community, friends, and families during the pandemic time; (iv) Expat teachers' embryo intention to reconsider their current teaching location.

HIDDEMANN1 for the GERMAN AML COOPERATIVE GROUP (AML-CG) 1University of München; 2University of Regensburg; 3University of Münster; 4University of Köln; 5Stä dtisches Klinikum Braunschweig; 6Klinikum Augsburg, Germany One of the prime objectives of the planned new generation of the AML-CG studies will be the evaluation of dose density of AraC during the induction phase. In the past total dose was increased by implementing high-dose AraC regimens (HAM -6 to 18g/m2 per cycle) in place of standard dose AraC regimens (TAD 1,4g/m2 per cycle) during the induction phase. Thus the TAD-TAD double induction regimen has been progressively replaced by first the TAD-HAM regimen and now (following the last study generation AML-CG 1999) by the HAM-HAM regimen. This increase in total dose has yielded improved long term survival especially in patients with prognostically unfavourable characteristics. However since a) further increases in AraC dose are not feasible and b) leukemic regrowth between treatment cycles is expected to compromise long term results [1, 2] the new study generation will now increase dose density of AraC by reducing the treatment interval between two HAM cycles (from 17 days) to a minimum of 3 days thereby more than doubling dose intensity. The current pilot study is therefore intended to establish the feasibility of such a dose-dense protocol. In a first step the S-HAM protocol (originally intended for relapsed or refractory AML) was tested in first-line therapy because this regime already features the desired characteristics of a dose-dense double HAM regimen with a between cycle interval of only 3 days [3]. However since in this protocol both the high-dose AraC as well as the mitoxantrone are applied only on 2 days respectively as compared to 3 days as is the case in the conventional HAM regimen only a total dose of 66% is applied during S-HAM induction as compared to the 100% of standard HAM-HAM double induction. After establishing the feasibility of S-HAM (66% dose) in first-line therapy in a second step the total dose of the S-HAM regimen will therefore be increased to equal that of HAM-HAM double induction (S-HAM 100% dose). When feasibility of this dose-dense protocol is established the S-HAM (100% dose) regimen will constitute the new experimental arm for the phase III randomized AML-CG study comparing conventional HAM-HAM double induction as the standard arm to the experimental dose-dense S-HAM (100% dose) regimen. Mathematical modelling derived from the previous AML-CG studies have indicated that such an increase in dose-density is expected to result in a 5 -11% increase in event free survival [4]. Currently the feasibility of the conventional S-HAM (66% dose) regimen in first line therapy could be demonstrated. As of 09/2005 67 patients have been included into this pilot study of whom 51 were evaluable for response, 50 for critical neutropenia and 51 for grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicity. As shown in table 1 the early death rate (ED) was 6% (3 out of 51) and therefore does not exceed the ED rate observed previously in less dose-dense regimens (TAD-TAD 18%, TAD-HAM 12% 5,6) but rather shows a trend towards a decreased early mortality. In parallel a substantial antileukemic efficacy could be demonstrated with 71% of patients reaching a complete remission (CR) which compares favourably to results of TAD-TAD double induction (65% CR) and HAM-HAM (60% CR) [5, 6]). For quantification of hematological toxicities recovery of >500/l neutrophils was measured from the start of S-HAM (66% dose) therapy. As shown in figure 1 a median duration of critical neutropenia of 29 days was observed which is substantially less than the time to recovery from the start of double induction therapy (TAD-TAD 46 days, TAD-HAM 46 days [5, 6]). Regarding non-hematological toxicities expected grade IV toxicities were for infections during critical neutropenia 33%). Also grade III to IV toxicities for rises in bilirubin levels were observed in 6% of patients most likely due to the known hepatotoxic effects of high-dose AraC. In 8% of patients grade III and IV cutaneous toxicities were observed. These data are summarized in table 2 below. In summary in the first step of implementation of a dose-dense regimen in first line AML therapy (S-HAM -66% dose) no excess toxicity or ED rate was observed. Rather critical neutropenia was considerably shorter than in historical Table 1: Antileukemic efficacy of the S-HAM (66% dose) regimen CR PR/PL ED Total n 3 6 1 2 3 5 1 % 71 23 6 100 Table 2: Non-hematological toxicities (grade III and IV) Toxicities III˚IVB ilirubin 2 (4%) 1 (2%) GOT/GPT 3 (6%) 1 (2%) Alk.

Therefore in the next step the full dose of AraC and mitoxantrone is aimed for (S-HAM100% dose) and the feasibility of this approach will be checked. The next cohort of patients (n=20) will receive the first 5 days of therapy as in the regular HAM regimen but will then after a treatmentfree interval of three days receive the second part of therapy as in the S-HAM66% dose regimen -resulting in a total of 83% of the aimed for dose. Following this cohort of patients -provided no excess mortality as defined is observed -the remaining patients of the study will be treated with aimed for final dose (S-HAM100% dose). Again early stopping rules will apply in all remaining therapy phases indicating that the present trial will be stopped prematurely if the lower boundary of the 95%-confidence interval for the ED rate exceeds 20%. 5.

ec56af63c9c2d05ab1fceda0eb86472b4b0bce05	The continuously growing number of COVID-19 cases pressures healthcare services worldwide 1 . Accurate short-term forecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making 2 . The strategies adopted by countries to combat the pandemic vary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number of cases 1, 3 . Accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data and accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new modelling framework to describe the course of the pandemic with great accuracy, and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to six days ahead, and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has strong implications for global planning and decision making. We constantly update forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.
c91f21cf133b4b9e4d6a725d0dc05b4083a20bbe	Background Exposures to indoor biological contaminants have been implicated in asthma's aetiology but their effect on lung function is not well quantified. Objective The aim of this cross-sectional study of non-smoking, asthmatic adults in Scotland was to determine the correlation between the results from a standard spirometry test, forced expiratory volume in one-second percent (FEV 1 %), and quantitative estimates of some biological exposures. Methods A population (n = 55) of non-smoking, adult asthmatics in Scotland was included in this study and each completed a questionnaire that allowed the determination of the Asthma Control Questionnaire scores (ACQ) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores (SGRQ), as well as corticosteroid use. Spirometry testing was completed and the pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 % value calculated. At about the same time, floor dust samples were collected in the living room and in the bedroom. These dust samples were analysed for mould contamination, as described by the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values and by (1, 3)-b-D-glucan concentrations, for endotoxin, and for dust mite, cat, and dog allergen concentrations. The asthmatics' FEV 1 % values were tested for correlation (Pearson) to questionnaire-based estimates of health. Also, each biological exposure was tested for correlation (Pearson) to the FEV 1 % values. Results FEV 1 % results were correlated with ACQ scores (q À0.586, P < 0.001), SGRQ scores (q À0.313, P = 0.020), and weakly with corticosteroid use (q À0.221, P = 0.105). The ERMI values in the homes (average 5.3) were significantly correlated with FEV 1 % values (q À0.378, P = 0.004). There was no correlation between FEV 1 % and concentrations of endotoxin, (1, 3)-b-D-glucan, or any of the allergens. Conclusion and clinical relevance Although these results do not prove that mould exposures caused the deficit in lung function observed in this study, it might be advisable for asthmatics to avoid high ERMI environments.

067266eed362338d621bab33dadfa0b65b7add2a	Background: During the early stages of the pandemic, some coronavirus disease patients were misdiagnosed as having influenza, which aroused the concern that some deaths attributed to influenza were actually COVID-19-related. Howerver, little is known about whether coinfection with influenza contributes to severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the optimal therapeutic strategy for these patients. We retrospectively studied 128 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients were positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)positive by nucleic acid detection. 64 cases were co-infected with influenza A/B and the other 64 were influenza negative, matched by age, sex, and days from onset of symptoms. Results: Among the 64 co-infected patients, 54 (84.4%) were co-infected with influenza A, and 10 (15.6%) with influenza B. The median duration of viral shedding time from admission was longer for patients with influenza coinfection (17.0 days) than for those without influenza coinfection (12.0 days) (P<0.001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that the hazard ratio HR of resolution in lung involvement was 1.878 (P=0.020) for patients administered lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with those not administered lopinavir/ritonavir (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.103, 3.196). Among influenza co-infected patients, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited faster pneumonia resolution within two weeks after symptom onset (37% vs 1%, P=0.001). Conclusions: There was no difference in lung involvement between influenza coinfected and non-infected groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir eliminated the difference of lung involvement between influenza co-infected and non-infected groups, indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with pneumonia resolution in COVID-19.

efd9ac7cbde2b6a0e9602611624eab14e8afc45a	The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic first broke out in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has now spread worldwide. Laboratory findings have been only partially described in some observational studies. To date, more comprehensive systematic reviews of laboratory findings on COVID-19 are missing. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis to assess laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19. Observational studies from three databases were selected. We calculated pooled proportions and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using the random-effects model meta-analysis. A total of 1106 articles were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI (China), and other sources. After screening, 28 and 7 studies were selected for a systematic review and a meta-analysis, respectively. Of the 4,663 patients included, the most prevalent laboratory finding was increased Creactive protein (CRP; 73.6%, 95% CI 65.0-81.3%), followed by decreased albumin (62.9%, 95% CI 28.3-91.2%), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (61.2%, 95% CI 41.3-81.0%), decreased eosinophils (58.4%, 95% CI 46.5-69.8%), increased interleukin-6 (53.1%, 95% CI 36.0-70.0%), lymphopenia (47.9%, 95% CI 41.6-54.9%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 46.2%, 95% CI 37.9-54.7%). A meta-analysis of seven studies with 1905 patients showed that increased CRP (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1-4.4), lymphopenia (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0), and increased LDH (OR 6.7, 95% CI: 2.4-18.9) were significantly associated with severity. These results demonstrated that more attention is warranted when interpreting laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19. Patients with elevated CRP levels, lymphopenia, or elevated LDH require proper management and, if necessary, transfer to the intensive care unit. ARTICLE HISTORY
b6d878264d69f0d8a8415bb1e96e2a197e84b3e1	Purpose: Huashi Baidu formula (HSBDF) was developed to treat the patients with severe COVID-19 in China. The purpose of this study was to explore its active compounds and demonstrate its mechanisms against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through network pharmacology and molecular docking. Methods: All the components of HSBDF were retrieved from the pharmacology database of TCM system. The genes corresponding to the targets were retrieved using UniProt and GeneCards database. The herb-compound-target network was constructed by Cytoscape. The target protein-protein interaction network was built using STRING database. The core targets of HSBDF were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The main active compounds of HSBDF were docked with SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Results: Compound-target network mainly contained 178 compounds and 272 corresponding targets. Key targets contained MAPK3, MAPK8, TP53, CASP3, IL6, TNF, MAPK1, CCL2, PTGS2, etc. There were 522 GO items in GO enrichment analysis (p < .05) and 168 signaling pathways (p < .05) in KEGG, mainly including TNF signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that baicalein and quercetin were the top two compounds of HSBDF, which had high affinity with ACE2. Conclusion: Baicalein and quercetin in HSBDF may regulate multiple signaling pathways through ACE2, which might play a therapeutic role on COVID-19.
67e7efbd1d4c301ca5e676c366dbaf31f3bf3949	Background: Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in school aged children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) lead to increased morbidity and lung function decline. However, the effect of exacerbations in young children with CF is not fully understood. We sought to characterize the frequency and clinical impact of PEx in a pilot study of infants and pre-school aged children with CF. Methods: Thirty young children with CF [median (range) 1.5 years (0.2-4.9)] were prospectively followed for 2 years. Exacerbation frequency (hospitalizations and outpatient antibiotic use) was determined. Chest radiographs were performed at enrollment and study completion and assigned a Brasfield score. Lung function at age 7 years was assessed in a subset of children. The association between PEx frequency, chest radiograph score, and lung function was determined using Spearman correlation coefficients and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Correlations with an absolute magnitude of 0.3 or greater were considered clinically significant. Results: Over 2 years, participants experienced a median of two PEx (range 0-13). Chest radiograph scores at enrollment and study completion were inversely associated with PEx frequency (R = −0.48 and R = −0.44, respectively). The association between frequency of PEx and lung function [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 )] at age 7 years was small (R = 0.20). Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) at 7 years was associated with more frequent PEx during the study (R = 0.44). Conclusions: Children with worse chest radiograph scores had more frequent PEx over the subsequent 2 years, suggesting a group of patients at higher risk for PEx. Frequent PEx in infants and young children with CF were not associated with lower FEV 1 and FVC at 7 years, although spirometry in this age group may not be a sensitive marker of mild lung disease and disease progression.
4d931029cafe3919e6a8b43a756cacbdb8ccf659	Hemagglutinating and acetylesterase functions as well as the 124 kDa glycoprotein were present in the highly cell-culture adapted, avirulent bovine coronavirus strain BCV-L9, in the Norden vaccine strain derived from it, and in 5 wild-type, virulent strains that multiplied in HRT-18 cells but were restricted in several types of cultured bovine cells. The BCV-L9 and the wild-type strain BCV-LY-138 agglutinated chicken and mouse erythrocytes. The acetylesterase facilitated break-down of the BCV-erythrocyte complex with chicken but only to a minimal extent with mouse erythrocytes in the receptor-destroying enzyme test. Purified preparations of the vaccine and the wild-type strains agglutinated chicken erythrocytes at low titers and mouse erythrocytes at 128 to 256 times higher titers whereas receptor destroying enzyme activity was detectable only with chicken erythrocytes. When wild-type strains were propagated in HRT cells at low passage levels, they produced 5 x 105 to 4.5 x 106 plaque forming units per 50 gl which agglutinated erythrocytes from mice but not from chickens. Diisopropylfluoro-phosphate moderately increased the hemagglutination titers, but completely inhibited the receptor destroying enzyme of purified virus of all strains. It had virtually no infuence on the plaque-forming infectivity of the different BCV strains. The acetylesterase of strain BCV-L9 reacting in the receptor-destroying enzyme test was stable for 3 h at 37 and 42 "C. It was inactivated within 30 min at 56 °C while the hemagglutinin function of this strain was stable for 3 h at 37, 42, and 56 °C, but it was inactivated at 65 °C within lh.
6493e6374b1ab79aef927ea66a239463386d5109	Within the phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) family that hydrolyzes phospholipids to yield fatty acids and lysophospholipids, secreted PLA 2 (sPLA 2 ) enzymes comprise the largest group containing 11 isoforms in mammals. Individual sPLA 2 s exhibit unique tissue or cellular distributions and enzymatic properties, suggesting their distinct biological roles. Although PLA 2 enzymes, particularly cytosolic PLA 2 (cPLA 2 α), have long been implicated in inflammation by driving arachidonic acid metabolism, the precise biological roles of sPLA 2 s have remained a mystery over the last few decades. Recent studies employing mice gene-manipulated for individual sPLA 2 s, in combination with mass spectrometric lipidomics to identify their target substrates and products in vivo, have revealed their roles in diverse biological events, including immunity and associated disorders, through lipid mediator-dependent or -independent processes in given microenvironments. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the roles of sPLA 2 s in various immune responses and associated diseases. 93 sPLA 2 s in Immunity
fc193fcbd57c93846995b181353e28f7be7ad98d	In this short paper, I assess how COVID-19-related disruptions in transportation services, as well as new demands for transportation services, could impact Canadian agricultural supply chains. The brief analysis reveals that agricultural access to bulk ocean freight, rail movement, and trucking has generally improved in the pandemic, bolstered by the reduced demand for these transportation services by other sectors of the economy. The intermodal containerized movement of grains and food products has seen some disruption from the lack of empty containers in North America. The widespread consumer adoption of physical distancing measures has vastly increased the demand for retail food pickup and delivery services to the point where these services are being rationed by long wait times. From a policy perspective, there is an apparent need for (a) continued supply chain monitoring and industry engagement, (b) the proactive development of strategies to deal with absenteeism and other potential threats to the supply chain, and (c) an assessment of the economic and health merits of providing additional public resources to provide greater access to grocery pickup and delivery services.
46ec3a9b64437b3a7908f0efbf575e1645ee0419	A B S T R A C T Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infections and associated diseases have been rarely studied in Africa. There is no report of PCV2 infection-associated morbidity and the level of awareness of stakeholders has never been investigated in Uganda. This cross sectional survey investigated the occurrence of Porcine Circovirus type 2systemic disease (PCV2-SD) among pigs and the associated level of awareness of stakeholders in Central Uganda. Data were collected using questionnaires, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews and laboratory investigations. All respondents (n = 131) and farmers attending FGDs (n = 31) had never heard of PCV2-SD and only 16.7% (n = 2) of the interviewed animal health workers (n = 12) knew about the disease. Among the farms, 20 piglets presenting with a chronic wasting and a persistent diarrhea were detected and sampled for laboratory investigations. Severe lymphoid depletion with histiocytic and macrophage infiltration in lymphoid organs (n = 8), shortening of intestinal villi (n = 9), abscesses in various organs (n = 15) and granulomatous pneumonia (n = 2) were the major histopathological lesions described. Immunohistochemistry and PCR assays on organs with implicating lesions confirmed PCV2 infection in 25% (n = 5) of the 20 pigs. The study confirmed the occurrence of PCV2 infections among piglets with persistent diarrhea on pig farms in central Uganda and revealed a low level of associated knowledge among farmers and veterinary practitioners. The study arouses the need for systematic studies on prevalence of PCV2 infections and sensitization of stakeholders on occurrence of PCV2 infections in Uganda.
bc0a773f2d7e07d877d2fd3db7839dda64874651	In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), surface tension, T, is believed to be elevated and surfactant therapy has failed to reduce mortality. Here , we test whether various substances suggested to contribute to elevated T in ARDS in fact raise T in the lungs. And we test the ability of exogenous surfactant and of a potential alternative therapeutic, sulforhodamine B (SRB), to reduce T. We find exogenous surfactant unable to lower T in the presence of cell debris but SRB, which can be administered intravascularly, a candidate for lowering T in non-aspiration ARDS. BACKGROUND: In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), elevated alveolar surface tension, T, may increase ventilation-induced lung injury. Exogenous surfactant therapy has not reduced ARDS mortality. Sulforhodamine B (SRB), which acts with albumin to improve native lung surfactant efficacy, could be an alternative T-lowering therapeutic. We test whether substances suspected of elevating T in ARDS raise T in the lungs -where, unlike in most in vitro tests, the surfactant monolayer is intact -and test the abilities of exogenous surfactant and SRB to reduce T. METHODS: In isolated rat lungs, we micropuncture a surface alveolus and instill a solution containing a substance purported to raise T in ARDS: control saline, cell debris, secretory phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2 ), acid or mucins. We test each substance alone; with albumin, to model proteinaceous edema liquid; with albumin and subsequent exogenous surfactant; or with albumin and SRB. We determine T by combining servo-nulling pressure measurement with confocal microscopy, and applying the Laplace relation. RESULTS: In the control group, saline, albumin and Infasurf do not alter T; SRB reduces T below normal. With albumin, the experimental substances raise T. With cell debris, surfactant does not alter T; SRB normalizes T. With sPLA 2 , surfactant normalizes T; SRB reduces T. With acid or mucins, neither surfactant nor SRB alters T. CONCLUSIONS: The inability of surfactant to counter cell debris may contribute to the failure of surfactant therapy for ARDS. For non-aspiration ARDS, SRB, which can be delivered intravascularly to target injured lung regions, holds promise as a treatment.
54ebc03fe88092d143f0758472adf54252d6c224	Background: Hepatic steatosis is recognized as a major risk factor for liver disease progression and impaired response to interferon based therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. The mechanism of response to interferon-alpha (IFN-α) therapy under the condition of hepatic steatosis is unexplored. We investigated the effect of hepatocellular steatosis on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and IFN-α antiviral response in a cell culture model. Methods: Sub-genomic replicon (S3-GFP) and HCV infected Huh-7.5 cells were cultured with a mixture of saturated (palmitate) and unsaturated (oleate) long-chain free fatty acids (FFA). Intracytoplasmic fat accumulation in these cells was visualized by Nile red staining and electron microscopy then quantified by microfluorometry. The effect of FFA treatment on HCV replication and IFN-α antiviral response was measured by flow cytometric analysis, Renilla luciferase activity, and real-time RT-PCR. Results: FFA treatment induced dose dependent hepatocellular steatosis and lipid droplet accumulation in the HCV replicon cells was confirmed by Nile red staining, microfluorometry, and by electron microscopy. Intracellular fat accumulation supports replication more in the persistently HCV infected culture than in the sub-genomic replicon (S3-GFP) cell line. FFA treatment also partially blocked IFN-α response and viral clearance by reducing the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 dependent IFN-β promoter activation. We show that FFA treatment induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and down regulates the IFNAR1 chain of the type I IFN receptor leading to defective Jak-Stat signaling and impaired antiviral response. Conclusion: These results suggest that intracellular fat accumulation in HCV cell culture induces ER stress, defective Jak-Stat signaling, and attenuates the antiviral response, thus providing an explanation to the clinical observation regarding how hepatocellular steatosis influences IFN-α response in CHC.
928c0266f9fede929216a7c6f3370d32ff638401	Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and seasonal distribution of viral etiological agents and to compare their clinical manifestations and disease severity, including single and co infections. Methods: Multiplex reverse-transcription PCR was performed for the detection of viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirat. Disease severity was grouped using a categorization index as very mild/mild, and moderate/severe. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized children with viral respiratory tract infection were analyzed. Results: Viral pathogens were detected in 103/155 (66.5%) of patients. In order of frequency, identified pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (32.0%), adenovirus (26.2%), parainfluenza viruses type 1-4 (19.4%), rhinovirus (18.4%), influenza A and B (12.6%), human metapneumovirus (12.6%), coronavirus (2.9%), and bocavirus (0.9%). Coinfections were present in 21 samples. Most of the children had very mild (38.8%) and mild disease (37.9%). Severity of illness was not worse with coinfections. The most common discharge diagnoses were "URTI" with or without LRTI/asthma (n=58). Most viruses exhibited strong seasonal patterns. Leukocytosis (22.2%) and neutrophilia (36.6%) were most commonly detected in patients with adenovirus and rhinovirus (p<0.05). Monocytosis was the most remarkable finding in the patients (n=48, 53.3%), especially in patients with adenovirus (p<0.05). Conclusions: RSV and RhV were associated with higher severity of illness in hospitalized children. RSV found to account for half of LRTI hospitalizations. In AdV and FluA and B infections, fever lasted longer than in other viruses. Coinfections were detected in 21 of the patients. The presence of coinfections was not associated with increased disease severity.
076a4efc053789c9550341e247a9e5a273cd4c26	This study was designed to investigate the effect of Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41), a Japanese herbal medicine, on the development of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. ALI was induced in female BALB/c mice by the intranasal administration of 0.1 mg/kg LPS. The mice were divided into a group receiving normal feed and another group receiving feed mixed with TJ-41 at a dose of 1 g/kg/day for 8 weeks before LPS challenge. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the preadministration of TJ-41 caused significant reduction in the absolute number of total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. The preadministration of TJ-41 significantly inhibited increases in the serum level of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), which is a murine chemotaxin for neutrophils that corresponds to human interleukin-8, with respect to its concentration at 24 h after LPS challenge. Furthermore, the histopathologic findings indicated that alveolitis with leukocyte infiltration in the alveolar space was less severe in the TJ-41-treated mice than in the control mice. These findings indicated that the preadministration of TJ-41 could show an inhibitory effect on ALI in this experimental murine system associated with the suppression of chemokine production.
da8bd99cf1771969654dc5479f60d95636525c05	Four Bovidae cell lines (BEK-1, MDBK, Bu and EBTr) were characterized by means of enzymatic biochemical markers. Out of 15 enzymatic systems, 3adenosine deaminase [Ada), phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) and nucleoside phosphorylase (Np)were found to be polymorphic and quite suitable for biochemical identification of each cell line. The Bu cell line has shown a Np phenotypic pattern which could be distinctive of the Bison bison species.
83bed5c5041fbdf5cf932341384f833fd48bc18c	The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a bulk of scientific research and related Twitter discussions. To unravel the public concerns about the COVID-19 crisis reflected in the science-based Twitter conversations, this study tracked the Twitter attention around the COVID-19 research efforts during the first three months of 2020. On the basis of nearly 1.4 million Twitter mentions of 6,162 COVID-19-related scientific publications, we investigated the temporal tweeting dynamic and the Twitter users involved in the online discussions around COVID-19-related research. The results show that the quantity of Twitter mentions of COVID-19-related publications was on rising. Scholarlyoriented Twitter users played an influential role in disseminating research outputs on COVID-19, with their tweets being frequently retweeted. Over time, a change in the focus of the Twitter discussions can be observed, from the initial attention to virological and clinical research to more practical topics, such as the potential treatments, the countermeasures by the governments, the healthcare measures, and the influences on the economy and society, in more recent times.
6dc198b0fdf6ca5d7c0ae9044f62896a5562ba05	Since the beginning of Vladimir Putin's rule in Russia 20 years ago, Russia has lost much of the leverage that it previously enjoyed in the Baltics. On the one hand, Russia has antagonized Baltic states through its wars in Georgia and Ukraine, on the other hand, deep integration in the EU and NATO has pulled the Baltic states from the Russian zone of influence. This article discusses the gradual decrease of Russia's influence in the Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania while considering the increased NATO presence in the region, Baltic energy security, and Baltic Russian-speaking communities.
1c8677db11d0984021120e5eddd2e765250deee3	BACKGROUND. Mathematical coupling may explain why cardiac filling volumes obtained by transpulmonary thermodilution may better predict and monitor responses of cardiac output to fluid loading than pressures obtained by pulmonary artery catheters (PAC). METHODS. Eleven consecutive patients with hypovolaemia after coronary surgery and a PAC, allowing central venous pressure (CVP) and continuous cardiac index (CCIp) measurements, received a femoral artery catheter for transpulmonary thermodilution measurements of global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) and cardiac index (CItp). One to five fluid loading steps of 250 mL were done in each patient (n = 48 total). RESULTS. Fluid responses were predicted and monitored similarly by CItp and CCIp, whereas CItp and CCIp correlated at r = 0.70 (p \ 0.001) with a bias of 0.40 L min -1 m -2 . Changes in volumes (and not in CVP) related to changes in CItp and not in CCIp. Changes in CVP and GEDVI similarly related to changes in CItp, after elimination of two patients with greatest CItp outliers (as compared to CCIp). Changes in GEDVI correlated better to changes in CItp when derived from the same thermodilution curve than to changes in CItp of unrelated curves and changes in CCIp. CONCLUSIONS. After coronary surgery, fluid responses can be similarly assessed by intermittent transpulmonary and continuous pulmonary thermodilution methods, in spite of overestimation of CCIp by CItp. Filling pressures are poor monitors of fluid responses and superiority of GEDVI can be caused, at least in part, by mathematical coupling when cardiac volume and output are derived from the same thermodilution curve. Bland-Altman plot for cardiac index measurements with help of the transpulmonary (CItp) and pulmonary (CCIp) continuous thermodilution techniques Scatterplots showing relationship between the fluid-induced changes of global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) and transpulmonary (panel A) or pulmonary continuous (panel B) thermodilution techniques OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the effects of active mechanical circulatory support on sublingual microcirculation as a model for body tissue perfusion. METHODS. Between May 2008 and January 2009, nine consecutive patients received a mechanical support device (HeartMate II, TandemHeart, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) for end-stage chronic heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Microcirculation was investigated using a hand-held sidestream dark field imaging device. Perfused capillary density (PCD) and capillary red blood cell velocity (cRBCv) were assessed before device implantation (T0), immediately after implantation (T1), and one day post implantation (T2). Data are presented as median (interquartile range). RESULTS. Median age of the patients was 44 (37-54) years and 67% were male. Circulatory support devices significantly decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p = 0.04). Cardiac power index increased [0.31 (0.19-0.35) W m -2 at T0 vs. 0.50 (0.42-0.54) W m -2 at T1, p = 0.008) as well as central venous oxygen saturation [52 (46-61) % at T0 vs. 76 (65-85) % at T1, p = 0.01). There was a fourfold increase in tissue perfusion index, defined as sublingual PCD 9 cRBCv, during mechanical circulatory support [544 (384-671) at T0 vs. 1,932 (1,854-2,842) at T1, p = 0.008; Fig. 1 ). Microcirculatory parameters remained improved at T2. CONCLUSION. Mechanical circulatory support for severe heart failure is associated with a consistent, significant and sustained improvement in tissue perfusion, as measured at the bedside by a two-dimensional microcirculation imaging technique. INTRODUCTION. The second generation FloTrac software has been shown to reliably measure cardiac output (CO) in cardiac surgical patients. However, concerns have been raised regarding its accuracy in vasoplegic states, so that a new software has been developed (third generation). OBJECTIVES. The aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate the value of the third generation software in patients with sepsis, particularly when systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is low. We studied 58 septic patients with a pulmonary artery catheter and a radial (n = 32) or femoral (n = 26) arterial catheter. Reference CO was measured by bolus pulmonary thermodilution (iCO) using 3-5 cold saline bolus injected randomly through the respiratory cycle. Simultaneously, CO was computed using the second (CO G2 ) and the third generation FloTrac software (CO G3 ) from the arterial pressure curve recorded on a computer. CO was also measured by semi-continuous pulmonary thermodilution (CCO). A total of 401 simultaneous measurements of iCO, CO G2 , CO G3 , and CCO were available for comparison. RESULTS. The mean bias between CO G2 , CO G3 , CCO and iCO were -12 ± 16% (-1.0 ± 1.2 l/min), -3 ± 15% (-0.2 ± 1.1 l/min), and 8 ± 13% (0.6 ± 1.1 l/min). The percentage errors were 33% for CO G2 , 29% for CO G3 , and 29% for CCO. The bias between iCO and CO G2 was significantly correlated with SVR (r 2 = 0.37, p \ 0.0001). A very weak (r 2 = 0.05) relationship was also observed for the bias between iCO and CO G3 . The bias between iCO and CCO was not correlated with SVR. CONCLUSION. In patients with sepsis, the third generation FloTrac software is more accurate, more precise (percentage error \ 30%) and much less influenced by SVR than the second generation software. INTRODUCTION. The use of cardiac output (CO) values to provide a more detailed overview of the patient's circulation has driven the development of less invasive CO monitoring and allowed applied physiology to guide treatment. The LiDCO TM plus, monitor has been extensively validated in the ICU setting. It combines two systems; (1)The PulseCO system which uses a signal analysis (autocorrelation) to calculate continuous beat-to-beat CO from the arterial waveform (2) lithium dilution calibration to give a stat CO value. A unique calibration factor (CF) is derived from the combination of the software analysis and stat CO values, The CF is patient specific and scales the stroke volumes [vol = CF 9 250 9 (1 -exp(-k 9 P)]. The CF is proportional to aortic compliance which is known to be strongly influenced by the demographic differences between individuals. OBJECTIVES. To explore the relationship between CF and gender, age, weight and height and to determine if the CF can be estimated using this data. METHOD. 22 patients in ITU who had a LiDCOplus in clinical use were studied and relevant data, were recorded. LiDCO calibrations were performed as per our ICU protocol. Two initial calibrations at set up (avgCF) and at 24 h intervals thereafter (more frequently in the face of major haemodynamic changes). Data were collected from the obs chart and by electronic download from the LiDCO monitor. RESULTS. Gender, age, height and weight had moderate to good association to the avgCF. Using multivariable regression an equation was developed to estimate CF. (AvgCF = 0.391-0.176 9 sex -0.006 9 age ? 0.002 9 weight ? 0.511 9 height). Using this equation a Bland Altman graph was plotted which shows good agreement between the estimated and LiDCO generated values for CF. Mean bias was -0.007 and was not statistically significant (p = 0.853). 95% of the data lies between ±0.4-the majority of differences lying between ±0.2. CONCLUSION. Gender, age, weight and height all have a relationship to the average of the initial two CF's. The estimated value of the CF derived from an equation using multivariable regression showed good agreement with the actual LiDCO generated CF. Further analysis using this new data is ongoing and is being used to validate this equation further. REFERENCE(S). 1.

Bland Altman: estimated CF versus LiDCO Derived CF INTRODUCTION. Changes of cardiac output (CO) during passive leg raise (PLR) have been proposed as an easy, reproducible and reversible method for selecting patients that would benefit or not from fluid administration. A non invasive bioreactance-based technology (NI-COM) has proved to be accurate, precise and responsive for continuous CO monitoring [1]. OBJECTIVE. This study was designed to compare the PLR-induced change in CO as assessed by the NICOM and by trans thoracic echo-doppler (ECHO). We included patients programmed for major (cardiac, vascular and abdominal) elective surgery or during the recovery period of these operations. All patients were in stable normal hemodynamic conditions without any drug infusion. Values of CO were collected: before PLR (baseline), after 2 min of PLR made with a 45°angle (test) and 5 min after test return to baseline. NICOM values were obtained continuously and 3 min were averaged for comparison with ECHO. ECHO analyses were performed by seniors experienced cardiologists and three measurements were averaged. For each patient, predicted CO from physiological normative tables was also collected using a validated computer software. Since all patients were in stable steady state, this predicted CO at basal metabolism was taken as reference value for baseline and return to baseline. We obtained complete data form 50 patients, 39 men 11 women, age 63 ± 28 years, LVEF = 56 ± 9%. NICOM and ECHO values of CO were close at baseline (5.59 ± 1.32 vs. 5.51 ± 1.22, NS) and also very close to predicted values: 5.50 ± 0.91. During PLR and after PLR (return to baseline 2) (NS for all differences) NICOM and ECHO CO values were close (6.28 ± 1.50 vs. 5.96 ± 1.39, NS) and well correlated (NS from the identity line). The mean bias was = 0.08 L/min and the limits of agreement were 1.8 L/min giving a coefficient of variation of 32%. During PLR mean CO absolute increase tended to be higher for NICOM than for ECHO but did not reach significance (p = 0.11) as well as for proportional increase (13 ± 14 vs. 8 ± 6%, p = 0.07). The mean difference in PLR-induced CO changes between NICOM and ECHO was 5 ± 14%. In 68, 86 and 94% of the patients the discordance between the two devices was B10, B20 and B30%, respectively. The discordance was due to higher NICOM CO changes than ECHO during PLR is a vast majority of cases: 94, 98 and 100% for discordances [10, 20 and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSION. In this cohort of 50 volunteers in stable hemodynamic status before major cardiac surgery, CO was acceptably comparable at baseline and during PLR using NICOM and ECHO. INTRODUCTION. Cardiac output (CO) monitoring is limited by the need for invasive, expensive, or time-consuming methods. A new, noninvasive, system for continuous CO monitoring, based on chest bioreactance, has proved to be easy to use, accurate, precise and responsive [1]. OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to compare CO and stoke volume (SV) monitoring capabilities of this transthoracic bioreactance-based monitor (NICOM) with those of a pulse contour-based system (PICCO PC) using transpulmonary thermodilution (PICCO TD) as reference method. We designed a prospective, single center study in Intensive care unit, including consecutive, post-cardiac surgery, adult patients. Continuous minute-by-minute hemodynamic variables obtained from NICOM and PICCO PC were recorded and compared in 15 patients at baseline, during a lung recruitment maneuver (applying 20 cm H 2 O of PEEP) and following withdrawal of PEEP. PICCO TD measurements were also determined at baseline and during and after PEEP. The NICOM system uses an independent autocalibration process. PICCO TD was used automatically for calibration of PICCO PC. At baseline, we evaluated the accuracy (bias with the reference) and precision (2SD/mean) of these devices to measure CO and SV. During PEEP application and removal, we then assessed time responsiveness, amplitude responsiveness and reliability for detecting expected CO and SV changes. Mean CO values (PICCO TD) ranged from 1.6 to 8.0 L min -1 . At baseline, CO values were comparable for NICOM, PICCO PC and PICCO TD: 5.3 ± 1.2, 5.0 ± 1.5 and 4.8 ± 1.3 L min -1 , respectively (NS). The CO precision was 8 ± 7 and 9 ± 5% for NICOM and PICCO PC, respectively, NS. When PEEP was applied, CO was reduced by 33 ± 13%, 31 ± 15% and 35 ± 13%, for NICOM, PICCO PC and PICCO TD, respectively (NS). Time responsiveness was 3.2 ± 0.7 min for NICOM versus 2.6 ± 0.5 min for PICCO PC (NS). In all patients, the two studied technologies and the reference method showed a decrease in CO. SV results were comparable to CO. When all interpatients averaged points at baseline, during PEEP application and after PEEP removal were plotted together, the correlations NICOM versus PICCO TD and PICCO PC versus PICCO TD were comparable and not significantly different from the identity line. The mean bias of NICOM and PICCO PC was small (0.25 vs. 0.10 L min -1 , respectiveiy) and limits of agreement shown were quite large due to rapid and large changes in CO but comparable for NICOM (1.83 L min -1 ) and PICCO PC (1.93 L min -1 ), despite automatic recalibration of the PICCO PC. CONCLUSION. In this study, bioreactance and pulse contour analysis calibrated by transpulmonary thermodilution have comparable CO and SV monitoring capabilities.
2fe28b583545ed8c1b4e0f1554d1851ca7881576	Acute demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common type of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in Europe, following several viral and bacterial infections. Data on AIDP-patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus-2) infection are scarce. We describe the case of a 54-years-old Caucasian female patient with typical clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of AIDP, who was reported positive with PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 3 weeks prior to onset of the neurological symptoms. She did not experience a preceding fever or respiratory symptoms, but a transient loss of smell and taste. At the admission to our neurological department, a progressive proximally pronounced paraparesis, areflexia, and sensory loss with tingling of all extremities were found, which began 10 days before. The modified Erasmus Giullain-Barré Syndrome outcome score (mEGOS) was 3/9 at admission and 1/12 at day 7 of hospitalization. The electrophysiological assessment proved a segmental demyelinating polyneuropathy and cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an albuminocytologic dissociation. The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins. Our case draws attention to the occurrence of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not experience respiratory or general symptoms. It emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 induces immunological processes, regardless from the lack of prodromic symptoms. However, it is likely that there is a connection between the severity of the respiratory syndrome and further neurological consequences. K E Y W O R D S
fd04eebaf6820c01279e95775c6ac03761598d02	Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in adults on the autistic spectrum, and more recently, the challenges related to aging in this population. A two-day Think Tank meeting, focused on aging in autism, was convened amongst international leaders in the field of autism research and practice. This meeting included a series of presentations addressing the current status of aging research, followed by discussions regarding priorities going forward. Attendees shared their thoughts and concerns regarding community services, government policies, societal perspectives and physical and mental health. The goal of these discussions was to consider systematic approaches aimed at providing meaningful supports that can ensure a quality of life for seniors on the autism spectrum.
39e066c95d89964b9cd608c14fc5e2077706e72e	The aim of the workshop was to discuss the latest trends in using high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics, and allied technologies to analyze immune and pathogen repertoires and their interplay within the host, bringing together key international players in the field and Singapore-based researchers and clinicianscientists. The focus was in particular on the application of these technologies for the improvement of patient diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and for other broad public health outcomes. The presentations by scientists and clinicians showed the potential of deep sequencing technology to capture the coevolution of adaptive immunity and pathogens. For clinical applications, some key challenges remain, such as the long turnaround time and relatively high cost of deep sequencing for pathogen identification and characterization and the lack of international standardization in immune repertoire analysis.
f3a75a57d895e69896c77e7a887e26211501c816	Background: Heliox has a lower density and higher diffusion capacity compared to oxygen-in-air. We hypothesized that heliox ventilation allows for a reduction in minute volume ventilation and inspiratory pressures needed for adequate gas exchange in an animal model of an acute lung injury. Methods: After intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg), adult rats were randomized to ventilation with either a gas mixture of helium/oxygen (50:50%) or oxygen/air (50:50%). They were mechanically ventilated according to the ARDSnet recommendations with tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg and monitored with a pneumotachometer. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for markers of lung injury, and embedded lung sections were histologically scored for lung injury. Results: Heliox limited the increase in driving pressures needed to achieve preset tidal volumes, with a concomitant decrease in loss of compliance. Heliox did neither allow for reduced minute volume ventilation in this model nor improve gas exchange. Also, heliox did not reduce lung injury. Conclusions: Heliox modestly improved respiratory mechanics but did not improve lung injury in this rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
55df5b0e2270ace956aaaa7a065dea47c5922a32	The ultrastructure of Oryz~ sativa L. cells in suspension was determined as cells developed, matured and senesced at 3, 10, and 17 days, respectively, after transfer to fresh medium. Although cultures of 3-day-old ceils contained some senescent cells, the symptoms of cell aging were very conspicuous at 10 days and were most pronounced at 17 days. The amount of cytoplasm decreased as the number of lyric areas, myelin figures and vesicle bodies increased. Other noticeable subcellular changes observed were ultrastructural modifications of mitochondria, proplastids, amyloplasts, and nuclei. Such changes were associated with a general deterioration of the lipoprotein complex of the cell during its growth. A fibrous structure without an external membrane was observed and its reported for the first time for cells grown in suspension culture.
0bef80ab1a275c438a9b994bdfc42af1af2732de	Pathogenic free-living amoebae (FLA), such as Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris and Acanthamoeba species isolated from aquatic environments have been implicated in central nervous system, eye and skin human infections. They also allow the survival, growth and transmission of bacteria such as Legionella, Mycobacteria and Vibrio species in water systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the co-occurrence of potentially pathogenic FLA and their associated bacteria in hospital water networks in Johannesburg, South Africa. A total of 178 water (n = 95) and swab (n = 83) samples were collected from two hospital water distribution systems. FLA were isolated using the amoebal enrichment technique and identified using PCR and 18S rDNA sequencing. Amoebae potentially containing intraamoebal bacteria were lysed and cultured on blood agar plates. Bacterial isolates were characterized using the VITEK®2 compact System. Free-living amoebae were isolated from 77 (43.3 %) of the samples. Using microscopy, PCR and 18S rRNA sequencing, Acanthamoeba spp. (T3 and T20 genotypes), Vermamoeba vermiformis and Naegleria gruberi specie were identified. The Acanthamoeba T3 and T20 genotypes have been implicated in eye and central nervous system infections. The most commonly detected bacterial species were Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Delftia acidovorans, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Comamonas testosteroni. These nosocomial pathogenic bacteria are associated with systematic blood, respiratory tract, the urinary tract, surgical wounds and soft tissues infections. The detection of FLA and their associated opportunistic bacteria in the hospital water systems point out to a potential health risk to immune-compromised individuals.
ad8462ee6be4cf7ab5b17b2b81c713879c599a73	Human pathogenic positive single strand RNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses, including Chikungunya virus, pose severe health problems as for many neither efficient vaccines nor therapeutic strategies exist. To interfere with propagation, viral enzymatic activities are considered potential targets. Here we addressed the function of the viral macrodomains, conserved folds of non-structural proteins of many (+)ssRNA viruses. Macrodomains are closely associated with ADP-ribose function and metabolism. ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification controlling various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription and stress response. We found that the viral macrodomains possess broad hydrolase activity towards mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases ARTD7, ARTD8 and ARTD10 (aka PARP15, PARP14 and PARP10, respectively), reverting this posttranslational modification both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, the viral macrodomains possess only weak activity towards poly-ADP-ribose chains synthesized by ARTD1 (aka PARP1). Unlike poly-ADPribosylglycohydrolase, which hydrolyzes poly-ADP-ribose chains to individual ADP-ribose units but cannot cleave the amino acid side chain -ADP-ribose bond, the different viral macrodomains release poly-ADP-ribose chains with distinct efficiency. Mutational and structural analyses identified key amino acids for hydrolase activity of the Chikungunya viral macrodomain. Moreover, ARTD8 and ARTD10 are induced by innate immune mechanisms, suggesting that the control of mono-ADP-ribosylation is part of a host-pathogen conflict. ADP-ribosylation describes a posttranslational modification (PTM) in which an ADP-ribose (ADPr) moiety is transferred from NAD + onto substrate proteins with release of nicotinamide. Intracellular ADP-ribosylation is mainly catalyzed by enzymes of the ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as PARP family) 1 . Based on their biochemical features ARTDs can be subdivided into three groups: members of the first group (including ARTD1/2/5/6) are able to iteratively transfer multiple ADPr units onto their substrates resulting in the formation of long branched ADPr polymers (PAR). Group II enzymes (ARTD7/8/10-12/14-17) are restricted to mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation), in part due to the lack of a catalytically active glutamate. The latter have been suggested to use substrate-assisted catalysis to modify their targets 2,3 . Whether ARTD3 and 4 belong to group I or II, despite both having a catalytic glutamate, is somewhat controversial and requires further analyses 3 . Acceptor amino acids for ADP-ribosylation are still a matter of debate with some discrepancy between biochemical and mass spectrometry studies. Nevertheless, acidic amino acids are considered important acceptor sites for both group I and II enzymes 4 . Our own findings with ARTD10 strongly suggest that glutamates are the main sites of modification 2 . Proteins of the third group (ARTD9/13) lost the ability to bind NAD + due to amino acid substitutions in the NAD + binding pocket and therefore are catalytically inactive 1,5 . Recent evidence defines reader domains that are capable of interacting specifically with MARylated or poly-ADP-ribosylated (PARylated) substrates and thus participate in disseminating the information associated with this PTM 6,7 . Moreover, erasers have been identified that hydrolyze bonds between single ADPr units and between ADPr and the modified amino acid, defining ADP-ribosylation as a fully reversible PTM 7,8 . A key protein fold involved in both reading and erasing ADP-ribosylation is the macrodomain, an evolutionary conserved structural domain 3,7-9 . Several macrodomains, including the one of the core histone macroH2A1.1, interact with ADPr polymers 7,9 . Others bind selectively to MARylated substrates, as shown for macrodomain 2 (macro2) or macrodomain 3 (macro3) of murine Artd8 10 . The macrodomains of ARTD7 are poorly characterized, while those of ARTD9 have been suggested to affect transcription and the DNA damage response 7,8 . Importantly, some macrodomains possess enzymatic activity. For example, the macrodomain of poly-ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (PARG) degrades PAR chains, whereas the macrodomains of TARG1, MacroD1 and MacroD2 remove the terminal, protein bound ADPr unit 11-14 . Thus the latter enzymes hydrolyze the ester bond between the ADPr and a most likely acidic acceptor amino acid 11,12 . Together these findings document the important role of macrodomain folds in regulating ADP-ribosylation function and metabolism. ADP-ribosylation is implicated in a variety of biological processes including DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, mitosis, transcription, and signaling 4,6,15 . A growing body of information suggests functions for MARylation at the interface between host and pathogens 3 . On the one hand MARylation of host proteins is catalyzed by a range of bacterial toxins, thereby promoting pathogenesis 16 . Thus MARylation is a conserved mechanism for host protein modulation to promote virulence. On the other hand accumulating evidence links intracellular MARylation to the innate immune response 17 . Infection of human monocytes by Borrelia burghdorferi results in elevated expression of ARTD8, 10 and 12 18 . In line with these findings, the expression of these three genes is also induced by interferon (IFN) responsive factor 1 as part of an antiviral program 19 . Moreover, monitoring the IFN response by a reporter gene construct defined ARTD10 as a type I IFN-stimulated gene 20 . ARTD7, 10 and 12 are induced upon IFNβ stimulation and inhibit alphavirus replication 21 . Furthermore, these proteins participate in repression of protein translation when combined with viral infection 21, 22 . In addition to these molecular and cell biological studies, evolutionary analyses indicate a broad role of ADP-ribosylation in virus-host interactions 23 . Several ARTD family members are under strong recurrent positive selection, including ARTD7, 8 and 9, the three ARTD family members possessing macrodomains as well as the catalytically inactive ARTD13 23 . The latter has been well established in antiviral immune defense. ARTD13 interferes with viral RNA translation and replication by interaction with viral RNA through its four CCCH-type zinc fingers thereby promoting its degradation 3 . Taken together these findings strongly imply important functions for ARTD family members in innate immunity and thus suggest that ADP-ribosylation and its functional consequences contribute to the resolution of host-pathogen conflicts. As mentioned above, macrodomains can function as readers as well as erasers of MARylation 7,8 . The fact that macrodomains are also conserved domains of non-structural proteins of some positive single strand RNA ((+ ) ssRNA) viruses provides further evidence for a function of ADP-ribosylation in innate immunity 24,25 . These ((+ ) ssRNA) viruses include members of the alphavirus genus such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), O'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV); members of the orthohepevirus genus among them Hepatitis E virus (HEV), as well as members of the alphacoronavirus genus, to which Feline Infectious Peritonitis virus (FIPV), a mutant of Feline coronavirus, belongs. Some of these viruses are human pathogens. For example CHIKV, transmitted by mosquitoes, has resulted in large epidemics in recent years. One of its effects is severe joint pain that can last for months or even years, thus having considerable long-term effects on human health 26, 27 . CHIKV, among other (+ )ssRNA viruses, is one of the top rated pathogens that is in need for vaccine development 28 . The viral macrodomains (vMDs) of the above mentioned viruses are only poorly characterized with regard to biochemical properties and biological functions. Some of the vMDs were shown to bind free ADPr as well as PAR 25 , while ADP-ribose-1″ -monophosphatase (ADRP) activity was assigned to others 24, 29, 30 . Moreover, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus harbors two additional macrodomain folds in the SARS-unique domain, which lack ADPr binding, but instead interact with G-quadruplexes 31-34 . Very recently ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity has been reported for the viral macrodomains of HEV, SARS (the macrodomain fold of the X domain), and VEEV 35 . Several findings provide evidence for a biological relevance of vMDs. Mutation of the ADPr binding region of the SINV macrodomain of the non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) impairs viral replication in neurons 36 . Mutations in the vMD with ADRP activity of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E resulted in increased sensitivity to the antiviral effect of IFNα compared with their wildtype counterparts 37 . Moreover, the mouse hepatitis virus macrodomain promotes virulence in mice 38 . vMDs thus seem to be critical for viral pathogenesis and evasion of the host immune response. Here we have further evaluated the interplay of ADP-ribosylation and vMDs. We demonstrate that the genes encoding ARTD8 and ARTD10 are targets of IFNα signaling and thus are likely components of a first line immune response to viruses. Furthermore, we provide a detailed biochemical analysis of diverse vMDs revealing
0232a35a783bad8256acca8661995b2f89bc5ad2	Background: Intracranial injury (ICI) from abusive head trauma is the leading cause of death among young abused children but is difficult to detect. Long bone fracture (LBF) may lead to the recognition of abuse in young abused children. Objectives: This study is the first to report the incidence and features of ICI in children with abuse and LBFs. Methods: This is a retrospective study of children younger than 3 years with the diagnosis of LBF in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2009 to 2014. LBF, abuse, and clinical features were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Abuserelated LBF with and without ICI were compared to identify risk factors for ICI. Results: There were 4345 encounters for abuse-related LBF in kids ages < 3 years; 970 (22%) had ICI. Infants < 1 year of age were more likely to have ICI compared with older children (odds ratio [OR] 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-2.33). After adjusting for age, fracture of the ulna, radius, tibia, or fibula were associated with greater odds of ICI (OR 3.35, 95% CI 2.81-4.00). Abuse-related LBF with additional findings of skull fracture, rib fracture, or head/neck bruising had an increased odds of ICI (OR 8.27, 95% CI 6.85-9.98; OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.28-3.14; OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.99-2.92, respectively). Conclusions: ICI occurred in nearly 1 in 4 children under 3 years old with abuse-related LBF. Abuse-related LBF with skull fracture, rib fracture, head/neck bruising, or patient age < 1 year should prompt consideration for ICI with head imaging. Ó 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
2221e6593a50a94cc5c2f592b9f970c92d2cc2e5	A number of Asian cities decided to establish gaming and resort facilities in order to capitalize on the growing number of gamblers and their family members in Asia. In doing so, they expect to sustain economic growth but, on the other hand, will consume a considerable amount of energy. Nevertheless, the causal relationship between economic growth and electricity consumption in this type of serviceoriented territories has never been investigated. Using the historical data obtained from the Government of Macao SAR, we found that electricity consumption and economic growth in terms of gross domestic product are co-integrated for the period of 1999 Quarter 1e2008 Quarter 4. Moreover, vector error correction (VEC) models indicated a lack of short-run relationships but showed that there was a long-run equilibrium relationship between electricity consumption and gross domestic product. The accuracy of VEC models was assessed by using the mean squared error and the mean absolute error. The error analysis shows that VEC models reproduced time series of gross domestic product and electricity consumption in difference form accurately.
36738a162e0983e65c5971238caa5ebbcb08788a	Prone positioning is used for surgical access and recently in exponentially growing numbers of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who are ventilated prone. To reduce their facial pressure ulcer risk, prophylactic dressings can be used; however, the biomechanical efficacy of this intervention has not been studied yet. We, therefore, evaluated facial soft tissue exposures to sustained mechanical loads in a prone position, with versus without multi-layered silicone foam dressings applied as tissue protectors at the forehead and chin. We used an anatomically realistic validated finite element model of an adult male head to determine the contribution of the dressings to the alleviation of the sustained tissue loads. The application of the dressings considerably relieved the tissue exposures to loading. Specifically, with respect to the forehead, the application of a dressing resulted in 52% and 71% reductions in soft tissue exposures to effective stresses and strain energy densities, respectively. Likewise, a chin dressing lowered the soft tissue exposures to stresses and strain energy densities by 78% and 92%, respectively. While the surgical context is clear and there is a solid, relevant need for biomechanical information regarding prophylaxis for the prone positions, the projected consequences of the coronavirus pandemic make the present work more relevant than ever before.
6338a6003446f87e273e5e6faea242b49e094891	Background: Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. One of the primary organs affected by sepsis is the lung, presenting as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Organ damage in sepsis involves an alteration in gene expression, making gene transfer a potential therapeutic modality. This work examines the feasibility of applying simian virus 40 (SV40) vectors for pulmonary gene therapy. Methods: Sepsis-induced ARDS was established by cecal ligation double puncture (2CLP). SV40 vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene (SV/luc) were administered intratracheally immediately after sepsis induction. Sham operated (SO) as well as 2CLP rats given intratracheal PBS or adenovirus expressing luciferase served as controls. Luc transduction was evaluated by in vivo light detection, immunoassay and luciferase mRNA detection by RT-PCR in tissue harvested from septic rats. Vector abundance and distribution into alveolar cells was evaluated using immunostaining for the SV40 VP1 capsid protein as well as by double staining for VP1 and for the surfactant protein C (proSP-C). Immunostaining for T-lymphocytes was used to evaluate the cellular immune response induced by the vector. Results: Luc expression measured by in vivo light detection correlated with immunoassay from lung tissue harvested from the same rats. Moreover, our results showed vector presence in type II alveolar cells. The vector did not induce significant cellular immune response. In the present study we have demonstrated efficient uptake and expression of an SV40 vector in the lungs of animals with sepsis-induced ARDS. These vectors appear to be capable of in vivo transduction of alveolar type II cells and may thus become a future therapeutic tool.

9c48e164be404a4eb0e062f94020145514e56d15	Background . Widespread use of masks in the general population is being used in many countries for Covid-19 . There has been reluctance on the part of the WHO and some governments to recommend this . Methodology . A basic model has been constructed to show the relative risk of aerosol from normal breathing in various situations together with the benefit from use of masks which is multiplicative . Results . Social distancing at 2 metres is validated but in confined areas is time limited and the use of masks in the absence of extremely good ventilation is important. Where social distancing is not possible at all times or an infectious person is in a confined area for a prolonged period there is a higher risk of infection requiring higher grade protection . Conclusions . The use of masks should be factored into models and used at an early stage as widespread use of more efficient masks could have a large impact on control and spread of infection . Public health planning requires stockpiling masks and encouraging everyone to have suitable masks in their household when supplies are normalised . The use of a cloth mask will be better than no protection at all .
772196e66e0bb0aa57f36058281e8e8225be7468	The lungs provide a large inner surface to guarantee respiration. In lung alveoli, a delicate membrane formed by endo-and epithelial cells with their fused basal lamina ensures rapid and effective gas exchange between alveolar and vascular compartments while concurrently forming a robust barrier against inhaled particles and microbes. However, upon infectious or sterile inflammatory stimulation, tightly regulated endothelial barrier leakiness is required for leukocyte transmigration. Further, endothelial barrier disruption may result in uncontrolled extravasation of protein-rich fluids. This brief review summarizes some important mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial barrier regulation and disruption, focusing on the role of specific cell populations, coagulation and complement cascades and mediators including angiopoietins, specific sphingolipids, adrenomedullin and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species for the regulation of pulmonary endothelial barrier function. Further, current therapeutic perspectives against development of lung injury are discussed.

2718d50101d585d27c5c817dfe2fb1dded056e1a	Feline calicivirus (FCV) can cause painful oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis/stomatitis, fever and depression in infected cats; highly virulent virus variants can lead to fatal epizootic outbreaks. Viral transmission occurs directly or indirectly via fomites. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and viability of FCV in the environment after sequential oronasal infections of specified pathogen-free cats with two FCV field strains in a research facility. Replicating virus was detected in saliva swabs from all ten cats after the first and in four out of ten cats after the second FCV exposure using virus isolation to identify FCV shedders. In the environment, where cleaning, but no disinfection took place, FCV viral RNA was detectable using RT-qPCR on all tested items and surfaces, including cat hair. However, only very limited evidence was found of replicating virus using virus isolation. Viral RNA remained demonstrable for at least 28 days after shedding had ceased in all cats. Disinfection with 5% sodium bicarbonate (and Incidin TM Plus) and barrier measures were effective in that no viral RNA was detectable outside the cat rooms. Our findings are important for any multicat environment to optimize hygienic measures against FCV infection. Viruses 2019, 11, 958 2 of 16 assess the hygienic management [15] . In veterinary facilities or research catteries, nobody has so far investigated environmental contamination with FCV. It was the aim of this study to investigate the presence and viability of FCV in the environment of a research cat facility following two sequential experimental infections of cats with two different FCV field strains. Oropharyngeal shedding of FCV was tested in parallel. The findings of this study are important to optimize the hygienic management of private practices and veterinary hospitals and to prevent accidental, iatrogenic FCV infections in cats. Materials and Methods In the experiment, 10 male cats, aged 8 weeks and from an approved specified pathogen-free (SPF) facility were used. All cats were group-housed in a confined university facility in four connected rooms (total of~37.2 m 2 ) under ethologically and hygienically ideal conditions [16] . All experiments were conducted according to Swiss law and were approved by the veterinary office of the canton of Zurich (TVB ZH095/15, issued 11 August 2015). After the arrival of the cats and prior to the start of the experiment, each cat was clinically examined, and blood and plasma samples and conjunctival, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs were collected to verify the cats' SPF status. These samples were tested for FCV, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), hemoplasmas, parvovirus (FPV), herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) and coronavirus (FCoV), as previously described [17] [18] [19] . The presence of Bartonella henselae, Chlamydia felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma felis was tested [3, 17, 18, 20] . Feline gammaherpesvirus (FcaGHV) [21] was tested by PCR with modifications as described in Novacco et al., 2019 [22]. In addition, the serum samples were tested for antibodies against feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus and feline coronavirus by immunofluorescence assays as previously described [23, 24] , and for feline immunodeficiency virus by western blot [25] . All cats tested negative for all of these infections prior to the start of the experiment.
22238e30828eb4613d777bea7bd3ff321aae450c	Background: Important knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of migration medicine practice and the impact of pathogens imported by Canadian travellers. We present here a comprehensive, Canada-specific surveillance summary of illness in a cohort of returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants. : We extracted and analyzed (using standard parametric and nonparametric techniques) data from the Canadian Travel Medicine Network (CanTravNet) database for ill returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants who Results: During the study period, 4365 travellers and immigrants presented to a CanTravNet site, 3943 (90.3%) of whom were assigned a travel-related diagnosis. Among the 3115 non-immigrant travellers with a definitive travel-related diagnosis, arthropod bite (n = 127 [4.1%]), giardiasis (n = 91 [2.9%]), malaria (n = 77 [2.5%]), latent tuberculosis (n = 73 [2.3%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 66 [2.1%]) were the most common specific etiologic diagnoses. Among the 828 immigrants with definitive travel-related diagnoses, the most frequent etiologies were latent tuberculosis (n = 229 [27.7%]), chronic hepatitis B (n = 182 [22.0%]), active tuberculosis (n = 97 [11.7%]), chronic hepatitis C (n = 89 [10.7%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 41 [5.0%]). Potentially serious infections, such as dengue fever (61 cases) and enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi (36 cases), were common. Individuals travelling for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives (n = 500 [11.6% of those with known reason for travel]) were over-represented among those diagnosed with malaria and enteric fever, compared with other illnesses (for malaria 34/94 [36.2%] v. 466/4221 [11.0%]; for enteric fever, 17/36 [47.2%] v. 483/4279 [11.3%]) (both p < 0.001). For cases of malaria, there was also overrepresentation (compared with other illnesses) from business travellers (22/94 [23.4%] v. 337/4221 [8.0%]) and males (62/94 [66.0%] v. 1964/4269 [46.0%]) (both p < 0.001). Malaria was more likely than other illnesses to be acquired in sub-Saharan Africa (p < 0.001), whereas dengue was more likely than other illnesses to be imported from the Caribbean and South East Asia (both p = 0.003) and enteric fever from South Central Asia (24/36 [66.7%]) (p < 0.001). Interpretation: This analysis of surveillance data on ill returned Canadian travellers has detailed the spectrum of imported illness within this cohort. It provides an epidemiologic framework for Canadian practitioners encountering ill returned travellers. We have confirmed that travel to visit friends and relatives confers particularly high risks, which underscores the need to improve pretravel intervention for a population that is unlikely to seek specific pretravel advice. Potentially serious and fatal illnesses such as malaria and enteric fever were common, as were illnesses of public health importance, such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B.

62d8b0803a8434114d821854186b28edff34bf2c	The current outbreak of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands its rapid, convenient, and large-scale diagnosis to downregulate its spread within as well as across the communities. But the reliability, reproducibility, and selectivity of majority of such diagnostic tests fail when they are tested either to a viral load at its early representation or to a viral gene mutated during its current spread. In this regard, a selective "naked-eye" detection of SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable, which can be tested without accessing any advanced instrumental techniques. We herein report the development of a colorimetric assay based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), when capped with suitably designed thiol-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specific for N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, could be used for diagnosing positive COVID-19 cases within 10 min from the isolated RNA samples. The thiol-modified ASO-capped AuNPs agglomerate selectively in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate a change in its surface plasmon resonance. Further, the addition of RNaseH cleaves the RNA strand from the RNA−DNA hybrid leading to a visually detectable precipitate from the solution mediated by the additional agglomeration among the AuNPs. The selectivity of the assay has been monitored in the presence of MERS-CoV viral RNA with a limit of detection of 0.18 ng/μL of RNA having SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Thus, the current study reports a selective and visual "nakedeye" detection of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, without the requirement of any sophisticated instrumental techniques.
43c284998733a1d7cc474d14c378f08e4b509c63	The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes chikungunya fever, with clinical presentations such as severe back and small joint pain, and debilitating arthritis associated with crippling pains that persist for weeks and even years. Although there are several studies to evaluate the efficacy of drugs against CHIKV, the treatment for chikungunya fever is mainly symptom-based and no effective licensed vaccine or antiviral are available. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of three types of flavonoids against CHIKV in vitro replication. Three compounds: silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were evaluated for their in vitro antiviral activities against CHIKV using a CHIKV replicon cell line and clinical isolate of CHIKV of Central/East African genotype. A cytopathic effect inhibition assay was used to determine their activities on CHIKV viral replication and quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to calculate virus yield. Antiviral activity of effective compound was further investigated by evaluation of CHIKV protein expression using western blotting for CHIKV nsP1, nsP3, and E2E1 proteins. Briefly, silymarin exhibited significant antiviral activity against CHIKV, reducing both CHIKV replication efficiency and down-regulating production of viral proteins involved in replication. This study may have important consequence for broaden the chance of getting the effective antiviral for CHIKV infection.
32a0ef520c146e623492c579ee5e3ca160de78e1	Viral O-acetylesterases were first identified in several viruses, including influenza C viruses and coronaviruses. These enzymes are capable of removing cellular receptors from the surface of target cells. Hence they are also known as "receptor destroying" enzymes. We have cloned and expressed several recombinant viral O-acetylesterases. These enzymes were secreted from Sf9 insect cells as chimeric proteins fused to eGFP. A purification scheme to isolate the recombinant Oacetylesterase of influenza C virus was developed. The recombinant enzymes derived from influenza C viruses specifically hydrolyze 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, while that of sialodacryoadenitis virus, a rat coronavirus related to mouse hepatitis virus, is specific for 4-O-acetylated sialic acid. The recombinant esterases were shown to specifically de-O-acetylate sialic acids on glycoconjugates. We have also expressed esterase knockout proteins of the influenza C virus hemagglutininesterase. The recombinant viral proteins can be used to unambiguously identify O-acetylated acids in a variety of assays. Published in 2004.
2f93dbca64fa0d325704fc66859f47ef952cd515	Objective: Prolonged and unaddressed hypoxia can lead to poor patient outcomes. Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of early proning of awake, non-intubated patients in the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This pilot study was carried out in a single urban ED in New York City. We included patients suspected of having COVID-19 with hypoxia on arrival. A standard pulse oximeter was used to measure SpO 2 . SpO 2 measurements were recorded at triage and after 5 minutes of proning. Supplemental oxygenation methods included non-rebreather mask (NRB) and nasal cannula. We also characterized post-proning failure rates of intubation within the first 24 hours of arrival to the ED. Results: Fifty patients were included. Overall, the median SpO 2 at triage was 80% (IQR 69 to 85). After application of supplemental oxygen was given to patients on room air it was 84% (IQR 75 to 90). After 5 minutes of proning was added SpO 2 improved to 94% (IQR 90 to 95). Comparison of the pre-to post-median by the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test yielded P = 0.001. Thirteen patients (24%) failed to improve or maintain their oxygen saturations and required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of arrival to the ED. From the

eb0a05f4e7d9d276e308e8f6e80617962b07f9cb	Monoclonal antibodies are the dominant agents used in inhibition of biological target molecules for disease therapeutics, but there are concerns of immunogenicity, production, cost and stability. Oligonucleotide aptamers have comparable affinity and specificity to targets with monoclonal antibodies whilst they have minimal immunogenicity, high production, low cost and high stability, thus are promising inhibitors to rival antibodies for disease therapy. In this review, we will compare the detailed advantages and disadvantages of antibodies and aptamers in therapeutic applications and summarize recent progress in aptamer selection and modification approaches. We will present therapeutic oligonucleotide aptamers in preclinical studies for skeletal diseases and further discuss oligonucleotide aptamers in different stages of clinical evaluation for various disease therapies including macular degeneration, cancer, inflammation and coagulation to highlight the bright commercial future and potential challenges of therapeutic oligonucleotide aptamers.

The conjugates 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 have shown very promising antibacterial activity with MIC ranging between 0.09 and 0.67 mM against Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli. Further, the conjugates 2, 3, 6, 8 and 10 have been screened for their antiviral activities against HSV, VSV, FIPV, PIV-3, RSV and FHV and the molecules 2 and 3 have shown good results with EC 50 0.011 mM and 0.029 mM against VSV and FIPV/FHV, respectively. However, the molecules did not show expected results against HIV-1 III B and ROD strains in MTT assay.
42a6fd4f30e6c37c8b086df0b39b24df5952dd12	Lacaziosis is a cutaneous chronic mycosis caused by Lacazia loboi. Macrophages are important cells in the host immune response in fungal infections. The macrophage population exhibits strong plasticity that varies according to the stimuli in the microenvironment of lesions M1 profile promotes a Th1 pattern of cytokines and a microbicidal function and M2 is related to Th2 cytokines and immunomodulatory response. We investigated the population of M1 and M2 polarized macrophages in human cutaneous lesions. A total of 27 biopsies from human lesions were submitted to an immunohistochemistry protocol using antibodies to detect M1 and M2 macrophages (Arginase-1, CD163, iNOS, RBP-J and cMAF). We could observe high number of cells expressing Arginase1, CD163 and c-MAF that correspond to elements of the M2 profile of macrophage, over iNOS and RBP-J (elements of the M1 profile). The results suggest a predominant phenotype of M2 macrophages, which have an immunomodulatory role and probably contributing to chronicity of Lacaziosis.
ca930030395540cd911e24309cb83e7dff1a8f96	The tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing proteins have attracted particular attention to their multiple functions in different biological processes. TRIM13, a member of the TRIM family, is a RING domaincontaining E3 ubiquitin ligase which plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes including cell death, cancer and antiviral immunity. In this study, a TRIM13 homolog from orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (EcTRIM13) was cloned and characterized. The full-length of EcTRIM13 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 399 amino acids which shared 81% identity with TRIM13 homolog from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Amino acid alignment analysis showed that EcTRIM13 contained conserved RING finger and B-box domain. Expression patterns analysis indicated that EcTRIM13 was abundant in liver, spleen, kidney, intestine and gill. Moreover, the transcript of EcTRIM13 in grouper spleen was differently regulated after injection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or polyinosinpolycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Under fluorescence microscopy, we observed the tubular structure in wild type EcTRIM13 transfected cells, but the RING domain mutant resulted in the fluorescence distribution was changed and the bright punctate fluorescence was evenly situated throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting that the RING domain was essential for its accurate localization. Overexpression of EcTRIM13 in vitro obviously increased the replication of red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and the enhancing effect of EcTRIM13 on virus replication was affected by the RING domain. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM13 not only negatively regulated the interferon promoter activity induced by interferon regulator factor (IRF) 3, IRF7, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), but also decreased the expression of several interferon related factors. In addition, the overexpression of EcTRIM13 also differently regulated the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors. Together, our results firstly demonstrated that fish TRIM13 exerted negative regulation of antiviral response against nodavirus infection.
b07b79f7d03bce25f7d97ee50ed4c845c4cf20e6	Population adoption of social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic is at times deficient, increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Healthcare workers and those living in areas of intense transmission may benefit from implementing biosafety measures in their daily lives. A mixed-methods approach, combining components of single negotiation text and the Delphi method, was used to create a COVID-19 biosafety-at-home protocol. A consensus building coordinator liaised with 12 experts to develop the protocol over 11 iterations. Experts had more than 200 years of combined experience in epidemiology, virology, infectious disease prevention, and public health. A flyer, created from the final protocol, was professionally designed and initially distributed via social media and institutional websites/emails in Ecuador beginning on May 2, 2020. Since then, it has been distributed in other countries, reaching ∼7,000 people.
8be5900da085366ee4808713f7e80b3b1a5e67e0	The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) has been found to be an antigenic protein in a number of coronaviruses. Whether the N protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is antigenic remains to be elucidated. Using Western blot and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), the recombinant N proteins and the synthesized peptides derived from the N protein were screened in sera from SARS patients. All patient sera in this study displayed strong positive immunoreactivities against the recombinant N proteins, whereas normal sera gave negative immunoresponses to these proteins, indicating that the N protein of SARS-CoV is an antigenic protein. Furthermore, the epitope sites in the N protein were determined by competition experiments, in which the recombinant proteins or the synthesized peptides competed against the SARS-CoV proteins to bind to the antibodies raised in SARS sera. One epitope site located at the C-terminus was confirmed as the most antigenic region in this protein. A detailed screening of peptide with ELISA demonstrated that the amino sequence from Codons 371 to 407 was the epitope site at the C-terminus of the N protein. Understanding of the epitope sites could be very significant for developing an effective diagnostic approach to SARS.

Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus 16 disease 19 has rapidly spread to the entire world within a few months. The origin of SARS- CoV-2 has been related to the lineage B Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses 18 found in bats. Early characterizations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed the existence of a distinct 4 19 amino acid insert within the spike (S) protein (underlined, SPRRAR↓S), at the S1/S2 site located at the 20 interface between the S1 receptor binding subunit and the S2 fusion subunit. Notably, this insert 21 appears to be a distinguishing feature among SARS-related sequences and introduces a potential 22 cleavage site for the protease furin. Here, we investigate the potential role of this novel S1/S2 cleavage 23 site and present direct biochemical evidence for proteolytic processing by a variety of proteases. We 24 discuss these findings in the context of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, viral stability and transmission. Highlights -SARS-CoV-2 spike protein harbors a distinct 4 amino acid insertion at the S1/S2 site -The S1/S2 site can be cleaved by furin-like, trypsin-like and cathepsin proteases -The S1/S2 insert likely enhances spike protein cleavage by several proteases in vivo
235451b60cac00666f0e69e9d196d090da8609a5	An adenovirus 5 vector encoding for mouse interferon alpha, subtype 5 (mDEF201) was evaluated for efficacy against lethal cowpox (Brighton strain) and vaccinia (WR strain) virus respiratory and systemic infections in mice. Two routes of mDEF201 administration were used, nasal sinus (5-ml) and pulmonary (50-ml), to compare differences in efficacy, since the preferred treatment of humans would be in a relatively small volume delivered intranasally. Lower respiratory infections (LRI), upper respiratory infections (URI), and systemic infections were induced by 50-ml intranasal, 10-ml intranasal, and 100-ml intraperitoneal virus challenges, respectively. mDEF201 treatments were given prophylactically either 24 h (short term) or 56d (long-term) prior to virus challenge. Single nasal sinus treatments of 10 6 and 10 7 PFU/mouse of mDEF201 protected all mice from vaccinia-induced LRI mortality (comparable to published studies with pulmonary delivered mDEF201). Systemic vaccinia infections responded significantly better to nasal sinus delivered mDEF201 than to pulmonary treatments. Cowpox LRI infections responded to 10 7 mDEF201 treatments, but a 10 6 dose was only weakly protective. Cowpox URI infections were equally treatable by nasal sinus and pulmonary delivered mDEF201 at 10 7 PFU/mouse. Dose-responsive prophylaxis with mDEF201, given one time only 56 d prior to initiating a vaccinia virus LRI infection, was 100% protective from 10 5 to 10 7 PFU/mouse. Improvements in lung hemorrhage score and lung weight were evident, as were decreases in liver, lung, and spleen virus titers. Thus, mDEF201 was able to treat different vaccinia and cowpox virus infections using both nasal sinus and pulmonary treatment regimens, supporting its development for humans.

2e2a9d9d154ae5983a4dab8e9e6010565379732a	The infamous sign problem leads to an exponential complexity in Monte Carlo simulations of generic many-body quantum systems. Nevertheless, many phases of matter are known to admit a sign-problem-free representative, allowing efficient simulations on classical computers. Motivated by long standing open problems in many-body physics, as well as fundamental questions in quantum complexity, the possibility of intrinsic sign problems, where a phase of matter admits no signproblem-free representative, was recently raised but remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of an intrinsic sign problem in a broad class of gapped, chiral, topological phases of matter. Within this class, we exclude the possibility of stoquastic Hamiltonians for bosons (or 'qudits'), and of sign-problem-free determinantal Monte Carlo algorithms for fermions. The intrinsically sign-problematic class of phases we identify is defined in terms of topological invariants with clear observable signatures: the chiral central charge, and the topological spins of anyons. We obtain analogous results for phases that are spontaneously chiral, and present evidence for an extension of our results that applies to both chiral and non-chiral topological matter.

Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use is critical to providing a safe environment and to minimize the risk of contagion. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, a series of supply chain issues, constant changes in PPE use policy, and higher demand for PPE led to shortages in PPE, specifically N95 masks and face shields. Implementation of decontamination protocols successfully allowed N95 mask reuse but, required masks to be unsoiled. Face shields not only act as a barrier against the soiling of N95 face masks, they also serve as more effective eye protection from respiratory droplets over standard eye shields. The University of Nebraska Medical Center produced face shields using a combination of 3D printing and assembly with commonly available products. Approximately 112 face shields were constructed and made available for use in 72 hours. Importantly, we created and implemented a simple but effective decontamination protocol, which allowed reuse of the face shields. These methods were successfully implemented for in-house production of face shields used at Tripler Army Medical Center (Tripler AMC, Hawaii). The effectiveness of the decontamination protocol was evaluated using the average log 10 reduction in colony counts for Escherichia coli ATCC 8937 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). In this manuscript, we present our detailed protocol and supplies needed for printing 3D face shields to enable the rapid production of this product by individuals with little to no 3D printing experience, in times of urgent need.

Aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and severity of these symptoms among laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. Secondary objective is to determine their onset/recovery time.
25397e5a50461221e9a0706147a6b6e3ad449ac9	Background: Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has spread rapidly across much of the Middle East, but no quantitative mapping of transmission risk has been developed to date. Moreover, details of the transmission cycle of the virus remain unclear, particularly regarding the role of camels as a reservoir host for human infections. We present a first analysis of the environmental circumstances under which MERS-CoV cases have occurred in the Middle East, covering all case occurrences through May 2015, using ecological niche modeling approaches to map transmission risk. We compare the environmental breadth of conditions under which cases have reported camel contacts with that of the broader population of all cases, to assess whether camel-associated cases occur under a more restricted set of environmental circumstances. We documented geographic and environmental distributions of MERS-CoV cases across the Middle East, and offer preliminary mapping of transmission risk. We confirm the idea that climatic dimensions of camel-associated cases are more constrained and less variable than the broader suite of case occurrences; hence, camel exposure may be a key limiting element in MERS-CoV transmission. This study offers a first detailed geographic and environmental analysis of MERS-CoV distributions across the Middle East. Results indicated that camel-exposed cases occur under a narrower suite of environmental conditions than non-camel-exposed cases, suggesting perhaps a key role for camels in the transmission of the disease, and perhaps a narrower area of risk for 'primary, ' camel-derived cases of MERS.
1b890b31d97504c7accbae1c2c25cd70410c6763	Interferons (IFN) are widely used in treating coronavirus disease 2019 patients. 39 However, recent report of ACE2, the host factor mediating SARS-Cov-2 infection, as 40 interferon-stimulated, raised considerable safety concern. To examine the association between 41 the use and timing of IFN-α2b and clinical outcomes, we analyzed in a retrospective multicenter 42 cohort study 446 COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. Regression models estimated that early 43 administration (≤5 days after admission) of IFN-α2b was associated with reduced in-hospital 44 mortality compared to no IFN-α2b, while late administration of IFN-α2b was associated with 45 increased mortality. Among survivors, early IFN-α2b was not associated with hospital discharge 46 or CT scan improvement, while late IFN-α2b was associated with delayed recovery. Additionally, 47 early IFN-α2b and umifenovir (UFV) alone or together were associated with reduced mortality 48 and accelerated recovery compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone. We concluded that 49 administration of IFN-α2b during the early stage of COVID-19 may induce favorable clinical 50 responses. 51 52
defec90a94b6dbb6dd8dfa961ef4915a389a65a8	Background: Little is known on significance, diversity and characteristics of gut E. coli in goats despite their importance as food animals globally. We characterized the temporal dynamics in diversity of E. coli in fecal samples from a cohort of goat kids and adult meat goats on pasture over a one-year period. Isolates were characterized based on phylogenetic grouping, virulence genes; shiga toxins 1 and 2 (Stx1&Stx2) (STEC), intimin (eaeA), hemolysin (hly) and select important sero-groups (026, 045, 0103, 0126 and 0146) using molecular methods. Results: A total of 516 E. coli isolates were screened. Prevalence of virulence genes and STEC was 65 and 56% respectively. Prevalence of virulence genes and STEC was significantly higher in goat kids less than six months (76% /66%) than adults (48% /28%). Isolates with virulence profiles of two or more genes were also higher in young goat kids (50%) than adults (20%). Entero-pathogenic E. coli (EPEC-eaeA gene only) were mostly from pre-weaned goat kids while hly gene only isolates were significantly higher in adults. The stx1, stx2 and hly genes peaked around weaning (60, 63 and 52%) respectively. Goats kids were mostly hosts to group D (59%) while adults older than one year had B1 (75%) isolates. Group D isolates were most abundant at weaning (64%) and diarrhea samples (74%). Group B2 isolates overall (6%) were mostly detected around weaning (63%) while A isolates were 4% overall. Twenty-four isolates belonged to sero-groups 026, 0103 and 0146 with 70% of the isolates detected around weaning. Nineteen of these isolates were STEC with most harboring the stx1/stx2/hly/eae (25%) profile. Most belonged to O26 sero-group (75%) and phylogroup D (75%). Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first study to highlight longitudinal age related differences in E. coli phylogenetic diversity, abundance of virulence genes and select important sero-groups in goats. Differences detected suggest a possible role of age and weaning stress in influencing E. coli diversity in the gut of goats. The findings are relevant to both animal and public health to advise on further studies on caprine E. coli isolates as animal and human pathogens.
bda64532f4a16e2885868385170f8bc89ab8f789	In an effort to circumvent resistance to rapamycin -an mTOR inhibitor -we searched for novel rapamycindownstream-targets that may be key players in the response of cancer cells to therapy. We found that rapamycin, at nM concentrations, increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α in rapamycin-sensitive and estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells, but had only a minimal effect on eIF2α phosphorylation in the rapamycininsensitive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Addition of salubrinal -an inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylationdecreased expression of a surface marker associated with capacity for self renewal, increased senescence and induced clonogenic cell death, suggesting that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2α is detrimental to the cells' survival. Treating cells with salubrinal enhanced radiation-induced increase in eIF2α phosphorylation and clonogenic death and showed that irradiated cells are more sensitive to increased eIF2α phosphorylation than non-irradiated ones. Similar to salubrinal -the phosphomimetic eIF2α variant -S51D -increased sensitivity to radiation, and both abrogated radiation-induced increase in breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene, thus implicating enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2α in modulation of DNA repair. Indeed, salubrinal inhibited non-homologous end joining as well as homologous recombination repair of double strand breaks that were induced by I-SceI in green fluorescent protein reporter plasmids. In addition to its effect on radiation, salubrinal enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation and clonogenic death in response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor -vorinostat. Finally, the catalytic competitive inhibitor of mTOR -Ku-0063794 -increased phosphorylation of eIF2α demonstrating further the involvement of mTOR activity in modulating eIF2α phosphorylation. These experiments suggest that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2α decreases survival of cancer cells; making eIF2α a worthy target for drug development, with the potential to enhance the cytotoxic effects of established anti-neoplastic therapies and circumvent resistance to rapalogues and possibly to other drugs that inhibit upstream components of the mTOR pathway.
9216fa1dbaabd338da94a5d0df03239311748032	With over 7 million people infected globally and over 5 lakh deaths reported worldwide by COVID-19 virus, World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a pandemic. India is also suffering badly because of the current crisis, with more than 4 lakh people infected and 13000 deaths reported as on 20th June 2020. There is no respite in sight as of now as the numbers continue to increase exponentially with each passing day. The only possible control to the virus is the availability of a vaccine, which will take a few months to be available to masses. Till then, the global economy has to start reopening slowly with several precautionary measures in place as advised by the WHO, such as mandatory wearing of masks in public places, frequent hand washing, practising good personal hygiene, and social distancing. Recently, the government of India (GoI) has also opened its economy with all the precautionary measures in place. Disinfecting of places of work, modes of transport, hospitals, and common areas is emerging as a mammoth challenge. With the objective of arresting the spread of COVID-19 virus and providing an efficient solution to the above problem, a portable disinfectant device is designed. Undertaken as an Industry-academia collaboration, it is a joint initiative between Technopark@iitk (IIT Kanpur Research and Technology Park) and Industry. The novelty of this device lies in its innovative design that combines spraying of sanitising liquid and UV light-based disinfection methodologies. For this, the device uses two separate disinfection systems: (1) the pump-nozzle assembly for spraying the disinfectant, and (2) UV-C radiations to increase the virus kill efficiency.
3d34c9d65850124e3dfc86aba86ec05ef00823c4	The last day of 2019 delivered the first report to the World Health Organization (WHO) about a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Subsequent investigations identified the new comer, a novel coronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and thus was termed as SARS-CoV-2. Being very contagious, the new virus led the era of "COVID-19" which is the acronym of "coronavirus disease 2019," evoking an imminent threat to global health security with unprecedented devastating challenges to human kind. In this article, we provide a molecular overview on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and summarize tremendous efforts that have been made to develop a rapid confirmatory diagnostic test for COVID-19. The diagnostic performances of the available tests are analyzed based on the best current information from the early research.
dcbe4cd8e4408782c8ed6f5b02b00e652e161669	Transmission risk of air-borne diseases in public transportation systems is a concern. The paper proposes a modified Wells-Riley model for risk analysis in public transportation systems to capture the passenger flow characteristics, including spatial and temporal patterns in terms of number of boarding, alighting passengers, and number of infectors. The model is utilized to assess overall risk as a function of OD flows, actual operations, and factors such as mask wearing, and ventilation. The model is integrated with a microscopic simulation model of subway operations (SimMETRO). Using actual data from a subway system, a case study explores the impact of different factors on transmission risk, including maskwearing, ventilation rates, infectiousness levels of disease and carrier rates. In general, mask-wearing and ventilation are effective under various demand levels, infectiousness levels, and carrier rates. Maskwearing is more effective in mitigating risks. Impacts from operations and service frequency are also evaluated, emphasizing the importance of maintaining reliable, frequent operations in lowering transmission risks. Risk spatial patterns are also explored, highlighting locations of higher risk.
f4c9944650242f5d758049b3f2f6a47b87346e50	Clinical criteria for pertussis diagnosis and clinical case definitions for surveillance are based on a cough lasting two or more weeks. As several pertussis cases seek care earlier, a clinical tool independent of cough duration may support earlier recognition. We developed a data-driven algorithm aimed at predicting a laboratory confirmed pertussis. We enrolled children <12 months of age presenting with apnoea, paroxistic cough, whooping, or post-tussive vomiting, irrespective of the duration of cough. Patients underwent a RT-PCR test for pertussis and other viruses. Through a logistic regression model, we identified symptoms associated with laboratory confirmed pertussis. We then developed a predictive decision tree through Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm to predict laboratory confirmed pertussis. We enrolled 543 children, of which 160 had a positive RT-PCR for pertussis. A suspicion of pertussis by a physician (aOR 5.44) or a blood count showing leukocytosis and lymphocytosis (aOR 4.48) were highly predictive of lab confirmed pertussis. An algorithm including a suspicion of pertussis by a physician, whooping, cyanosis and absence of fever was accurate (79.9%) and specific (94.0%) and had high positive and negative predictive values (PPV 76.3% NPV 80.7%).

f4cb5c1bc8d5199a3bbee98951395f015eccdef9	The ability of isolated adrenocortical cells to secrete corticosterone in response to ACTH challenge declines as rats age, but the site or mechanism(s) of this impairment is still unknown. To test the functionality of steroidogenic capacity per se, we measured the key enzyme activities involved in corticosterone biosynthesis. We also measured the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content and nonsteroidogenic enzymes specific for subcellular fractions. Mitochondria and microsomal fractions were isolated from the adrenals of 2-, 12-, and 18month-old animals and used for various enzyme measurements. Mitochondrial side-chain cleavage enzyme activity (nanomoles per min mg protein" 1 ) increased from a mean of 0.43 ± 0.06 in 2-month-old rats to 1.26 ± 0.11 and 1.51 ± 0.06 in 12and 18-month old rats, respectively. After incubation with 5cholesten-3j8,25-diol (25-hydroxycholesterol; 25 fig/ml) sidechain cleave activity rose to 5.0 ± 0.6, 12.4 ± 1.2, and 16 ± 1.4 nmol min" 1 mg protein" 1 in adrenal mitochondrial fractions from 2-, 12-, and 18-month-old rats, respectively. In contrast, mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content did not vary with advancing age. Microsomal A 5 -3/3-hyroxysteroid dehydrogenase-A 5 -A 4isomerase activities were similar in 2-and 12-month-old rats, but 21-hydroxylase (nanomoles per min mg protein" 1 ) activity was significantly increased in 12-month-old rats (2-month-old, 5.2 ± 0.2; 12-month-old, 7.7 ± 0.5). Finally, mitochondrial 11/3hydroxylase was comparable in both age groups. In addition, activities of mitochondrial nonsteroidogenic enzymes, such as monoamine oxidase, amytal insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, did not change with age. It appears from the evidence presented that the activities of the steroidogenic enzymes are not responsible for the diminished capacity in corticosterone production seen with aging in the rat.

ee453a0b3ffef2e3b8ef098dd67035dc7d0dd115	Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionary ancient mechanism that culminates with the lysosomal degradation of superfluous or potentially dangerous cytosolic entities. Over the past 2 decades, the molecular mechanisms underlying several variants of autophagy have been characterized in detail. Accumulating evidence suggests that most, if not all, components of the molecular machinery for autophagy also mediate autophagy-independent functions.

966d4620700365cee6c1e5731ff4e8e47a56af9d	Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common form of autosomal recessive ataxia caused by a deficit in the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Although demyelination is a common symptom in FRDA patients, no multicellular model has yet been developed to study the involvement of glial cells in FRDA. Using the recently established RNAi lines for targeted suppression of frataxin in Drosophila, we were able to study the effects of general versus glial-specific frataxin downregulation. In particular, we wanted to study the interplay between lowered frataxin content, lipid accumulation and peroxidation and the consequences of these effects on the sensitivity to oxidative stress and fly fitness. Interestingly, ubiquitous frataxin reduction leads to an increase in fatty acids catalyzing an enhancement of lipid peroxidation levels, elevating the intracellular toxic potential. Specific loss of frataxin in glial cells triggers a similar phenotype which can be visualized by accumulating lipid droplets in glial cells. This phenotype is associated with a reduced lifespan, an increased sensitivity to oxidative insult, neurodegenerative effects and a serious impairment of locomotor activity. These symptoms fit very well with our observation of an increase in intracellular toxicity by lipid peroxides. Interestingly, co-expression of a Drosophila apolipoprotein D ortholog (glial lazarillo) has a strong protective effect in our frataxin models, mainly by controlling the level of lipid peroxidation. Our results clearly support a strong involvement of glial cells and lipid peroxidation in the generation of FRDA-like symptoms.
4e3aeec6bb6ea379bb97845dccfbbc832808264c	Background: Larval indices such as the house index (HI), Breteau index (BI) and container index (CI) are widely used to interpret arbovirus vector density in surveillance programmes. However, the use of such data as an alarm signal is rarely considered consciously when planning programmes. The present study aims to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of the infestation of Aedes aegypti, considering the data available in the Ae. aegypti Infestation Index Rapid Survey (LIRAa) for the city of Campina Grande, Paraíba State in Brazil. The global and local Moranʼs indices were used in spatial analysis to measure the effects of spatial dependencies between neighbourhoods, using secondary data related to HI and BI gathered from surveillance service. Results: Our analysis shows that there is a predominance of high rates of mosquito infestation, placing Campina Grande at a near-constant risk of arbovirus outbreaks and epidemics. A highly significant Moranʼs index value (P < 0.001) was observed, indicating a positive spatial dependency between the neighbourhoods in Campina Grande. Using the Moran mapping and LISA mapping, the autocorrelation patterns of Ae. aegypti infestation rates among neighbourhoods have revealed hotpots that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. Predominance of high infestation rates and clearer relationships of these between neighbourhoods were observed between the months of May and July, the period with the highest rainfall in the city. Conclusions: This analysis is an innovative strategy capable of providing detailed information on infestation locations to the relevant public health authorities, which will enable a more efficient allocation of resources, particularly for arbovirus prevention.
d0212b73d578c0840e5b020f96932cd8b0c1e42a	Integrating spontaneous breathing into mechanical ventilation (MV) can speed up liberation from it and reduce its invasiveness. On the other hand, inadequate and asynchronous spontaneous breathing has the potential to aggravate lung injury. During use of airway-pressure-release-ventilation (APRV), the assisted breaths are difficult to measure. We developed an algorithm to differentiate the breaths in a setting of lung injury in spontaneously breathing ewes. We hypothesized that differentiation of breaths into spontaneous, mechanical and assisted is feasible using a specially developed for this purpose algorithm. Ventilation parameters were recorded by software that integrated ventilator output variables. The flow signal, measured by the EVITA® XL (Lübeck, Germany), was measured every 2 ms by a custom Java-based computerized algorithm (Breath-Sep). By integrating the flow signal, tidal volume (V T ) of each breath was calculated. By using the flow curve the algorithm separated the different breaths and numbered them for each time point. Breaths were separated into mechanical, assisted and spontaneous. Bland Altman analysis was used to compare parameters. Comparing the values calculated by Breath-Sep with the data from the EVITA® using Bland-Altman analyses showed a mean bias of − 2.85% and 95% limits of agreement from − 25.76 to 20.06% for MV total . For respiratory rate (RR) RR set a bias of 0.84% with a SD of 1.21% and 95% limits of agreement from − 1.53 to 3.21% were found. In the cluster analysis of the 25th highest breaths of each group RR total was higher using the EVITA®. In the mechanical subgroup the values for RR spont and MV spont the EVITA® showed higher values compared to Breath-Sep. We developed a computerized method for respiratory flow-curve based differentiation of breathing cycle components during mechanical ventilation with superimposed spontaneous breathing. Further studies in humans and optimizing of this technique is necessary to allow for real-time use at the bedside.
aa779977e2eb9f20709fe36177c984272f8e3927	| Over the past decade, a genomics revolution, made possible through the development of high-throughput sequencing, has triggered considerable progress in the study of ancient DNA , enabling complete genomes of past organisms to be reconstructed. A newly established branch of this field, ancient pathogen genomics, affords an in-depth view of microbial evolution by providing a molecular fossil record for a number of human-associated pathogens. Recent accomplishments include the confident identification of causative agents from past pandemics, the discovery of microbial lineages that are now extinct, the extrapolation of past emergence events on a chronological scale and the characterization of long-term evolutionary history of microorganisms that remain relevant to public health today. In this Review , we discuss methodological advancements, persistent challenges and novel revelations gained through the study of ancient pathogen genomes.
43d4546954d672b14fe4ebe2a99bd1a1b4614df5	We are concerned with the issue of detecting changes and their signs from a data stream. For example, when given time series of COVID-19 cases in a region, we may raise early warning signals of an epidemic by detecting signs of changes in the data. We propose a novel methodology to address this issue. The key idea is to employ a new information-theoretic notion, which we call the differential minimum description length change statistics (D-MDL), for measuring the scores of change sign. We first give a fundamental theory for D-MDL. We then demonstrate its effectiveness using synthetic datasets. We apply it to detecting early warning signals of the COVID-19 epidemic using time series of the cases for individual countries. We empirically demonstrate that D-MDL is able to raise early warning signals of events such as significant increase/decrease of cases. Remarkably, for about 64% of the events of significant increase of cases in studied countries, our method can detect warning signals as early as nearly six days on average before the events, buying considerably long time for making responses. We further relate the warning signals to the dynamics of the basic reproduction number R0 and the timing of social distancing. The results show that our method is a promising approach to the epidemic analysis from a data science viewpoint. The software for the experiments is available at https://github.com/ IbarakikenYukishi/differential-mdl-change-statistics.

This is set as follows: for some parameter δ > 0, when the parameter is d-dimensional, w = (2 + d/2 + δ) log w + log(1/δ). 9 4 Result II: Applications to COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis Since the beginning of 2020, many countries have experienced the epidemic of COVID-19. And not a few countries have enacted social distancing policies, e.g., stay-at-home order, closing non-essential services, and limiting travel, to prevent the spread. 12 22
4a17cedf8c94b518c91dfa6719832894b5dd0417	Type I IFN production is one of the hallmarks of host innate immune responses upon virus infection. Whilst most respiratory viruses carry IFN antagonists, reports on human metapneumovirus (HMPV) have been conflicting. Using deep sequencing, we have demonstrated that HMPV particles accumulate excessive amounts of defective interfering RNA (DIs) rapidly upon in vitro passage, and that these are associated with IFN induction. Importantly, the DIs were edited extensively; up to 70 % of the original A and T residues had mutated to G or C, respectively. Such high editing rates of viral RNA have not, to our knowledge, been reported before. Bioinformatics and PCR assays indicated that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) was the most likely editing enzyme. HMPV thus has an unusually high propensity to generate DIs, which are edited at an unprecedented high frequency. The conflicting published data on HMPV IFN induction and antagonism are probably explained by DIs in virus stocks. The interaction of HMPV DIs with the RNA-editing machinery and IFN responses warrants further investigation.
7fddfe37d98a8e20ad6357fc68bab068eb72d720	COVID-19 has become a worldwide threat to humans, and neutralizing antibodies 35 have therapeutic potential. We have purified more than one thousand memory B cells 36 specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD (receptor binding domain), and obtain 729 paired 37 heavy and light chain fragments. Among these, 178 antibodies test positive for 38 antigen binding, and the majority of the top 17 binders with EC 50 below 1 nM are RBD 39 binders. Furthermore, we identify 11 neutralizing antibodies, 8 of which show an IC 50 40 within 10 nM, and the best one, 414-1, with IC 50 of 1.75 nM. Through epitope 41 mapping, we find 3 main epitopes in RBD recognized by these antibodies, and 42 epitope B antibody 553-15 could substantially enhance the neutralizing abilities of 43 most of the other antibodies. We also find that 515-5 could cross-neutralize the 44 SARS-CoV pseudovirus. Altogether, our study provides 11 potent human neutralizing 45 antibodies for COVID-19 as therapeutic candidates. 46 47 Introduction 48
a8934871dfe7ff600199821efc833fa3995e2329	By 27 February 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused 82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally, more than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013, respectively. COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days. The basic reproductive number (R 0 ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.
c2bec5ed11d3d8e5f658560e6849b6594060ef5c	We present a mathematical model that would allow one to describe the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 between two neighboring cities or countries. This model is analyzed both analytical and numerically. It is a preliminary model because it assumes that the migration rate and the mortality rate are constant over time. Despite these simplifications, only two of the four equilibrium conditions were deduced from the system of equations proposed in this paper. Finally, we show an example the transmission dynamics between Portugal and Spain according to the cases registered before June 3, 2020.
109a7800d93fdf2a2c64a261aab1182dd5b607af	Our objective was to study the incidence, etiology, and diagnosis of multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON) and its treatment options to facilitate an earlier diagnosis and to optimize treatment. A radiological investigation was performed in osteonecrosis patients with a high risk of MFON for a more accurate diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2015. For patients with osteonecrosis of both the hip and knee joints or for patients with a history of corticosteroid use or alcohol abuse who had osteonecrosis of one or more joints in the shoulder, ankle, wrist or elbow, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed on other joints, regardless of whether these joints were symptomatic. Furthermore, we performed a radiological screening of 102 patients who had a negative diagnosis of MFON but were at a high risk; among them, another 31 MFON cases were successfully identified (30.4%). Thus, the incidence of MFON during the study period increased from 3.1% to 5.2%. Patients diagnosed with osteonecrosis and who are at a high risk of MFON should have their other joints radiologically examined when necessary. This will reduce missed diagnosis of MFON and facilitate an earlier diagnosis and treatment to achieve an optimal outcome.
4e2cb0a54b6fa519a52d293d02bf8b1f3e71eeac	To overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems in Europe, we established in 2008 a European-wide consortium aimed at introducing an innovative information and communication technology approach for a web-based surveillance system across different European countries, called Influenzanet. The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and containment measures. In this article, we describe the scientific and technological issues faced during the development and deployment of a flexible and readily deployable web tool capable of coping with the requirements of different countries for data collection, during either a public health emergency or an ordinary influenza season. Even though the system is based on previous successful experience, the implementation in each new country represented a separate scientific challenge. Only after more than 5 years of development are the existing platforms based on a plug-and-play tool that can be promptly deployed in any country wishing to be part of the Influenzanet network, now composed of The Netherlands,
0b7581ab8ae5da78a11692b4c7d9399ec6dea283	Background: In this study we evaluated the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR for the detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Mycoplasma (M.) dispar, M. bovis and M. bovirhinis, all three associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Primers and probes of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR are based on the V3/V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene of the three Mycoplasma species. Results: The analytical sensitivity of the RespoCheck triplex real-time PCR was, as determined by spiking experiments of the Mycoplasma strains in Phosphate Buffered Saline, 300 colony forming units (cfu)/mL for M. dispar, and 30 cfu/mL for M. bovis or M. bovirhinis. The analytical sensitivity of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCRwas, as determined on purified DNA, 10 fg DNA per assay for M. dispar and 100 fg fo rM. bovis and M. bovirhinis. The analytical specificity of the RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR was, as determined by testing Mycoplasmas strains (n = 17) and other bacterial strains (n = 107), 100, 98.2 and 99.1% for M. bovis, M. dispar and M. bovirhinis respectively. The RespoCheck Mycoplasma triplex real-time PCR was compared with the PCR/DGGE analysis for M. bovis, M. dispar and M. bovirhinis respectively by testing 44 BALF samples from calves. Conclusion: In conclusion, the RespoCheck PCR assay can be a valuable tool for timely and accurate detection of three Mycoplasma species associated with in bovine respiratory disease.
fa715de73cbaac44e0a2f1d9461006996e11a11a	There has recently emerged a striking consistency to the mortality from SARS-CoV-2, [1,2,3] as a fraction of population, across many nations. We have constructed a model for the spread of the virus that reproduces this phenomenon via inclusion of two (or more) categories of susceptibility to the virus. In the simplest case, the population is given a smaller fraction of 10-20% with higher susceptibility and the balance of 80-90% with lower susceptibility. Susceptibility is taken to include the level of immunity to the virus combined with the societal circumstances of certain smaller groups within a population. This is programmed numerically by considering a realistic random rate of contacts, together with an assumed constant viral genome. The remaining major variable is the societal response of nations to the outbreak, with earlier or later application of various degrees of lockdown, tracing and sanitation. China, South Korea and other nations, including Germany, have stopped or greatly slowed the spread of the disease before it could run its course through a whole population. Using this model the extent of progress toward herd immunity is discussed, with an in-principle estimate of the remaining toll to be experienced.
abd53dcf1f9552913a4e99b759c0df469577d5b5	Regulations (IHR) aim to prevent, detect and respond to such threats, through increase in national public health core capacities, but whether IHR core capacity implementation is necessary and sufficient has been contested. With a longitudinal study we relate changes in national IHR core capacities to changes in cross-border infectious disease threat events (IDTE) between 2010 and 2016, collected through epidemic intelligence at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). By combining all IHR core capacities into one composite measure we found that a 10% increase in the mean of this composite IHR core capacity to be associated with a 19% decrease (p = 0.017) in the incidence of cross-border IDTE in the EU. With respect to specific IHR core capacities, an individual increase in national legislation, policy & financing; coordination and communication with relevant sectors; surveillance; response; preparedness; risk communication; human resource capacity; or laboratory capacity was associated with a significant decrease in cross-border IDTE incidence. In contrast, our analysis showed that IHR core capacities relating to point-of-entry, zoonotic events or food safety were not associated with IDTE in the EU. Due to high internal correlations between core capacities, we conducted a principal component analysis which confirmed a 20% decrease in risk of IDTE for every 10% increase in the core capacity score (95% CI: 0.73, 0.88). Globally (EU excluded), a 10% increase in the mean of all IHR core capacities combined was associated with a 14% decrease (p = 0.077) in cross-border IDTE incidence. We provide quantitative evidence that improvements in IHR core capacities at country-level are associated with fewer cross-border IDTE in the EU, which may also hold true for other parts of the world. epidemic, infectious diseases, International Health Regulations, outbreak, pandemic, threat events This is an open access article under the terms of the Creat ive Commo ns Attri bution-NonCo mmerc ial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.
82575a6a31f143a0b0bf95b87621ee78cae6a56b	Northern Italy has been one of the European regions reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The pandemic spread has challenged the National Health System, requiring reallocation of most of the available health care resources to treat COVID-19-positive patients, generating a competition with other health care needs, including cancer. Patients with cancer are at higher risk of developing critical illness after COVID-19 infection. Thus, mitigation strategies should be adopted to reduce the likelihood of infection in all patients with cancer. At the same time, suboptimal care and treatments may result in worse cancer-related outcome. In this article, we attempt to estimate the individual riskbenefit balance to define personalized strategies for optimal breast cancer management, avoiding as much as possible a general untailored approach. We discuss and report the strategies our Breast Unit adopted from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak to ensure the continuum of the best possible cancer care for our patients while mitigating the risk of infection, despite limited health care resources. The Oncologist 2020;25:e1013-e1020 Implications for Practice: Managing patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak is challenging. The present work highlights the need to estimate the individual patient risk of infection, which depends on both epidemiological considerations and individual clinical characteristics. The management of patients with breast cancer should be adapted and personalized according to the balance between COVID-19-related risk and the expected benefit of treatments. This work also provides useful suggestions on the modality of patient triage, the conduct of clinical trials, the management of an oncologic team, and the approach to patients' and health workers' psychological distress.
b3a35fc23255e518be903728270de70868b5252c	appropriate reperfusion strategy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unclear. Methods: This retrospective single-center study consecutively enrolled patients who presented with STEMI and scheduled for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) during the outbreak of COVID-19. Due to the delay in the reporting of the polymerase chain reaction test results, our postprocedural triage regarding COVID-19, followed by the isolation strategy, was based on lung computerized tomography scan results. Results: Forty-eight patients with STEMI referred to our center. PPCI was done for 44 (91%) of these patients. The mean symptom-to-device time was 490.93 ± 454.608 minutes, and the mean FMC-to-device time was and 154.12 ± 36.27 minutes. Nine (18%) patients with STEMI were diagnosed as having typical/indeterminate features indicating COVID-19 involvement. During hospitalization, 1 (2.0%) patient died of cardiogenic shock. The study population was followed for 35.9 ± 12.7 days. Two patients expired in another centers due to COVID-19. No cardiac catheterization laboratory staff members were infected by COVID-19 during the study period. Conclusions: Our small report indicates that by taking the recommended safety measures and using appropriate PPE, we can continue PPCI as the main reperfusion strategy safely and effectively.
84e83fd44218e122aac7e2d7a71d1d330d8d8d30	Mini Abstract: This perspective piece discusses the impact of COVID-19 on moving the delivery of surgical consultations and care to virtual platforms and how this questions the necessity of the physical exam. Surgical training and culture highlight the importance of the physical exam, of the power of touch, to determine diagnosis and treatment plans and to solidify the doctor-patient relationship. Despite the advent of technology capable of providing a secure platform for remote consultations, surgeons have been reluctant to abandon the physical exam and move into the realm of telehealth and virtual medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has forced surgeons to re-evaluate their traditional paradigms of practice in order to provide appropriate care for surgical patients in the safest way possible. The pandemic has demonstrated the potential for virtual consultations; in doing so, it has highlighted that visits can occur remotely without necessarily limiting the quality of care that surgeons provide. This lesson should transform surgical practice even after the resolution of COVID-19.
b861538c988a7cec98952d2659df706360ee0596	Background/Aims: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan City, and a retrospective analysis is necessary to provide clinicians with the characteristics of traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the characteristics of TDIs under the transmission control measures in Wuhan City utilising an epidemiologic investigation. In this retrospective study, epidemiologic information, including the number of patients, gender, age, as well as TDI parameters such as time since injury to the clinic visit, aetiology, tooth location, and the type of injury, were extracted from the records of patients in the hospital from two periods: Period 1 (
be99996c561fe43928f9914548fcd3a49563ade0	Background: Healthcare personnel often use incorrect technique for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE). Objective: We tested the hypothesis that medical students receive insufficient training on correct methods for donning and doffing PPE. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical students on clinical rotations at two teaching hospitals to determine the type of training they received in PPE technique. The students performed simulations of contaminated PPE removal with fluorescent lotion on gloves and were assessed for correct PPE technique and skin and/or clothing contamination. To obtain additional information on PPE training during medical education, residents, fellows, and attending physicians completed written questionnaires on PPE training received during medical school and on knowledge of PPE protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Of 27 medical students surveyed, only 11 (41%) reported receiving PPE training, and none had received training requiring demonstration of proficiency. During simulations, 25 of 27 (92.5%) students had one or more lapses in technique and 12 (44%) contaminated their skin with fluorescent lotion. For 100 residents, fellows and attending physicians representing 67 different medical schools, only 53% reported receiving training in use of PPE and only 39% selected correct donning and doffing sequence. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need for development of effective strategies to train medical students in correct use of PPE.
f849450ab9fb78e47a3712c3e7abc2ff1a4a4cbc	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 is rapidly spreading with a rising death toll and transmission rate reported in high income countries rather than in low income countries. The overburdened healthcare systems and poor disease surveillance systems in resource-limited settings may struggle to cope with this COVID-19 outbreak and this calls for a tailored strategic response for these settings. Here, we recommend a low cost blockchain and artificial intelligence-coupled self-testing and tracking systems for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases. Prompt deployment and appropriate implementation of the proposed system have the potential to curb the transmissions of COVID-19 and the related mortalities, particularly in settings with poor access to laboratory infrastructure.
aeed9087445f398a01bd494efc4dc8920bfba559	Smog disasters are becoming more and more frequent and may cause severe consequences on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas. Social media as a real-time urban data source has become an increasingly effective channel to observe people's reactions on smog-related health hazard. It can be used to capture possible smogrelated public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smogrelated health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard. In addition, this forecasting approach can provide decision support for smog-related health hazard management through functions like early warning.
c75f621127556f16cbd1d5beab98ac20b05810cf	The Natural Immune System (NIS) is a distributed system that solves challenging search and response problems while operating under constraints imposed by physical space and resource availability. Remarkably, NIS search and response times do not scale appreciably with the physical size of the animal in which its search is conducted. Many distributed systems are engineered to solve analogous problems, and the NIS demonstrates how such engineered systems can achieve desirable scalability. We hypothesize that the architecture of the NIS, composed of a hierarchical decentralized detection network of lymph nodes (LN) facilitates efficient search and response. A sub-modular architecture in which LN numbers and size both scale with organism size is shown to efficiently balance tradeoffs between local antigen detection and global antibody production, leading to nearly scale-invariant detection and response. We characterize the tradeoffs as balancing local and global communication and show that similar tradeoffs exist in distributed systems like LN inspired artificial immune system (AIS) applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Taking inspiration from the architecture of the NIS, we propose a modular RADAR (Robust Adaptive Decentralized search with Automated Response) strategy for distributed systems. We demonstrate how two existing distributed systems (a LN inspired multi-robot control application and a P2P system) can be improved by a modular RADAR strategy. Such a sub-modular architecture is shown to balance the tradeoffs between local communication (within artificial LNs and P2P clusters) and global communication (between artificial LNs and P2P clusters), leading to efficient search and response.
02160d77412b8d730f1c5338b62e88b492a10708	High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is an uncommon form of pulmonary edema that occurs in healthy individuals within a few days of arrival at altitudes above 2,500-3,000 m. The crucial pathophysiology is an excessive hypoxia-mediated rise in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) or hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) leading to increased microvascular hydrostatic pressures despite normal left atrial pressure. The resultant hydrostatic stress can cause both dynamic changes in the permeability of the alveolar capillary barrier and mechanical damage leading to leakage of large proteins and erythrocytes into the alveolar space in the absence of inflammation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and pulmonary artery (PA) and microvascular pressure measurements in humans confirm that high capillary pressure induces a high-permeability non-inflammatorytype lung edema; a concept termed "capillary stress failure." Measurements of endothelin and nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air, NO metabolites in BAL fluid, and NO-dependent endothelial function in the systemic circulation all point to reduced NO availability and increased endothelin in hypoxia as a major cause of the excessive hypoxic PA pressure rise in HAPE-susceptible individuals. Other hypoxia-dependent differences in ventilatory control, sympathetic nervous system activation, endothelial function, and alveolar epithelial sodium and water reabsorption likely contribute additionally to the phenotype of HAPE susceptibility. Recent studies using magnetic resonance imaging in humans strongly suggest nonuniform regional hypoxic arteriolar vasoconstriction as an explanation for how HPV occurring predominantly at the arteriolar level can cause leakage. This compelling but not yet fully proven mechanism predicts that in areas of high blood flow due to lesser vasoconstriction edema will develop owing to pressures that exceed the structural and dynamic capacity of the alveolar capillary barrier to maintain normal alveolar fluid balance. Numerous strategies aimed at lowering HPV and possibly enhancing active alveolar fluid reabsorption are effective in preventing and treating HAPE. Much has been learned about HAPE in the past four decades such that what was once a mysterious alpine malady is now a wellcharacterized and preventable lung disease. This chapter will relate the history, pathophysiology, and treatment of HAPE, using it not only to illuminate the condition, but also for the broader lessons it offers in understanding pulmonary vascular regulation and lung fluid balance.

6d40fdfacdcea332d646d748b3dbabb7831dd54c	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) LJB/03 was isolated from the fece of piglets infected with PEDV on a pig farm, Heilongjiang province, China. The M gene of LJB/03 was amplified from the RNA extracted directly from the fece samples by RT-PCR and cloned into pMD18-T vector. The M gene cDNA was sequenced and encompasses an open reading frame of 681 nucleotides, encoding a 226-amino acid protein. The LJB/03 M gene has a base composition of 152 adenines (22%), 153 cytosines (23%), 161 guanines (24%), and 214 thymines (31%). Sequence comparison with other PEDV strains selected from GenBank revealed that the LJB/03 M gene has a high sequence homology to those of other PEDV isolates, 97.80% with JMe2, 96.92% with KPEDV-9 (Korean field isolate), 97.36% with KPEDV-9 (Korean), 97.80% with Br1/87, and 97.94% with CV777. The encoded protein shared 97.79% amino acid identities compared with CV777, 97.35% with Br1/87, 97.79% with JMe2, 96.90% with KPEDV-9 (Korean field isolate), 96.46% with KPEDV-9 (Korean). Sequence analysis of the M gene, including genetic distance measurement, phylogenetic tree analysis, and residue substitution analysis, showed that all other PED viruses analyzed fell into three groups, and the LJB/03 itself branched in an independent group. These data revealed that the M gene nucleotide sequence of LJB/03 has some mutations in comparison with the other PED viruses.
750eb3af6059e879b20beac9fb982f85332dd552	Deciphering the way gene expression regulatory aspects are encoded in viral genomes is a challenging mission with ramifications related to all biomedical disciplines. Here, we aimed to understand how the evolution shapes the bacteriophage lambda genes by performing a high resolution analysis of ribosomal profiling data and gene expression related synonymous/silent information encoded in bacteriophage coding regions. We demonstrated evidence of selection for distinct compositions of synonymous codons in early and late viral genes related to the adaptation of translation efficiency to different bacteriophage developmental stages. Specifically, we showed that evolution of viral coding regions is driven, among others, by selection for codons with higher decoding rates; during the initial/progressive stages of infection the decoding rates in early/late genes were found to be superior to those in late/early genes, respectively. Moreover, we argued that selection for translation efficiency could be partially explained by adaptation to Escherichia coli tRNA pool and the fact that it can change during the bacteriophage life cycle. An analysis of additional aspects related to the expression of viral genes, such as mRNA folding and more complex/longer regulatory signals in the coding regions, is also reported. The reported conclusions are likely to be relevant also to additional viruses.
02aa9c5dd0d2af535d6f0554ef68507d4065db7b	Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide. Testing remains at a premium, and criteria for testing remains reserved for those with lower respiratory infection symptoms and/or a known high-risk exposure.
03e880c09dbfd6b00c9f5874fe37647be1cc55b5	Chicks hatched with high levels of maternal antibody had excellent protection (>95%) against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge at 1 day of age, but not at 7 days (<30%). This protection signi®cantly (P < 0:05) correlated with levels of local respiratory antibody and not with serum antibody. A high percentage of both maternal antibody-positive (Mab) and maternal antibody-negative (MabÀ) chicks failed to produce IBV antibody when vaccinated at 1 day of age by the intraocular route. In addition, Mab chickens had a weaker virus-neutralizing antibody response to a second IBV vaccination compared to MabÀ birds (P < 0:05). Mab chicks experienced a more rapid decline (P < 0:01) in maternal antibody after 1-day-of-age vaccination compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. A monoclonal antibody-based blocking ELISA that measured antibody levels speci®c to S1 glycoprotein of IBV correlated well with virus-neutralizing antibody titers. #
8e4a1132b0301964add6af40ca83b222d7f6d9e3	The ecological radiation of mammals to inhabit a variety of light environments is largely attributed to adaptive changes in their visual systems. Visual capabilities are conferred by anatomical features of the eyes as well as the combination and properties of their constituent light sensitive pigments. To test whether evolutionary switches to different niches characterized by dim-light conditions coincided with molecular adaptation of the rod pigment rhodopsin, we sequenced the rhodopsin gene in twenty-two mammals including several bats and subterranean mole-rats. We compared these to thirty-seven published mammal rhodopsin sequences, from species with divergent visual ecologies, including nocturnal, diurnal and aquatic groups. All taxa possessed an intact functional rhodopsin; however, phylogenetic tree reconstruction recovered a gene tree in which rodents were not monophyletic, and also in which echolocating bats formed a monophyletic group. These conflicts with the species tree appear to stem from accelerated evolution in these groups, both of which inhabit low light environments. Selection tests confirmed divergent selection pressures in the clades of subterranean rodents and bats, as well as in marine mammals that live in turbid conditions. We also found evidence of divergent selection pressures among groups of bats with different sensory modalities based on vision and echolocation. Sliding window analyses suggest most changes occur in transmembrane domains, particularly obvious within the pinnipeds; however, we found no obvious pattern between photopic niche and predicted spectral sensitivity based on known critical amino acids. This study indicates that the independent evolution of rhodopsin vision in ecologically specialised groups of mammals has involved molecular evolution at the sequence level, though such changes might not mediate spectral sensitivity directly.
b9d587239806b4c15ec6412ce1f03015c47d5e58	During Ebola virus (EBOV) infection, secreted glycoprotein (sGP) is found in large quantities in the serum of both patients and infected animal models. It is thought to serve as a decoy for anti-EBOV antibodies. Using an in vitro model incorporating treatment of non-infected human THP-1 macrophages with recombinant EBOV sGP, this study sought to examine the impact of sGP upon key macrophage functions. Macrophage polarization and phagocytic capacity of activated macrophages were found to be unaltered by sGP treatment. However, treatment with sGP inhibited macrophage production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 while the yield of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, remained intact. Interestingly, the migratory ability of macrophages was also diminished by sGP, potentially due to a decrease in expression of CD11b, a vital macrophage integrin. Thus, EBOV sGP may operate to diminish functional contributions of non-infected macrophages to increase the potential viral dissemination.
caf34dc95f513eba16331c99fbe0a1cbf1fe2557	Clinical and laboratory data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), particularly on the temporal progression of abnormal laboratory findings, are limited. We conducted a prospective study on the clinical, radiologic, and hematologic findings of SARS patients with pneumonia, who were admitted to National Taiwan University Hospital from March 8 to June 15, 2003. Fever was the most frequent initial symptom, followed by cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Twenty-four patients had various underlying diseases. Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lymphopenia. Other common abnormal laboratory findings included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. These clinical and laboratory findings were exacerbated in most patients during the second week of disease. The overall case-fatality rate was 19.7%. By multivariate analysis, underlying disease and initial CRP level were predictive of death.
aaeffce2d8edfc4fb9c6db31d89cced9b3dfe2c8	SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness known as which has spread to several countries around the world and a global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this virus. In silico analysis of the transcription start sites, promoter regions, transcription factors and their binding sites, gene ontology, CpG islands for SARS-CoV-2 viral genome are a first step to understand the regulation mechanisms of gene expression and association with genetic variations in the genomes. For this purpose, we first computationally surveyed all SARS-CoV-2 virus genes with the open reading frames from NCBI database and found eleven sequences to accomplish the mentioned features by using bioinformatics tools. Our analysis revealed that all (100%) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genes have more than one TSS. By taking all TSSs with the highest predictive score we determined promoter regions and identified five common candidate motifs (MVI, MVII, MVIII, MVIV and MVV) of which MVI was found to be shared by all promoter regions of SARS-CoV-2 virus genes with the least E-value (3.8e-056, statistically highly significant). In our further analysis of MVI we showed MVI serve as binding sites for a single transcription factor (TF) family, EXPREG, involved in the regulatory mode of these genes. From EXPREG family four TFs that belongs to Cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) and Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) group mostly serve as transcriptional activator whereas two TFs that belong to LexA group always serve as transcriptional repressor in different kinds of cellular processes and molecular functions. Therefore, we unfolded SARS-CoV-2 viral genome to shed light on its gene expression regulation that could help to design and evaluate diagnostic tests, to track and trace the ongoing outbreak and to identify potential intervention options.
dc45028785e8308de18df3a42fe11fe571da2cdc	Human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (hLTA4H), which is the final and rate-limiting enzyme of arachidonic acid pathway, converts the unstable epoxide LTA4 to a proinflammatory lipid mediator LTB4 through its hydrolase function. The LTA4H is a bi-functional enzyme that also exhibits aminopeptidase activity with a preference over arginyl tripeptides. Various mutations including E271Q, R563A, and K565A have completely or partially abolished both the functions of this enzyme. The crystal structures with these mutations have not shown any structural changes to address the loss of functions. Molecular dynamics simulations of LTA4 and tripeptide complex structures with functional mutations were performed to investigate the structural and conformation changes that scripts the observed differences in catalytic functions. The observed protein-ligand hydrogen bonds and distances between the important catalytic components have correlated well with the experimental results. This study also confirms based on the structural observation that E271 is very important for both the functions as it holds the catalytic metal ion at its location for the catalysis and it also acts as N-terminal recognition residue during peptide binding. The comparison of binding modes of substrates revealed the structural changes explaining the importance of R563 and K565 residues and the required alignment of substrate at the active site. The results of this study provide valuable information to be utilized in designing potent hLTA4H inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents.
85c4f6130ec3106a1a44d6b2345ade7e1d31d7b2	The way people have thought about disasters has changed in almost immeasurable ways. They are no longer considered as "Acts of God" but caused either by natural hazards or by human actions. This shift in thinking has led to different ways of dealing with disasters. What is becoming apparent is that more and more disasters are being produced by human actions. We cause them but seem unable to find the political will to stop doing so. Further, the role of humanitarian agencies has changed. At one time bodies such as the Red Cross would be associated with helping the injured in the battlefield. The nature of present-day warfare or complex emergencies and terrorism means that humanitarian bodies are dealing with many vulnerable refugees and internally displaced people. The following polemic reflects on these changes.
99c2e15dc83fd3e2e211e56ae899b2f1ad6a9f24	Most children who present with acute onset of barky cough, stridor, and chest-wall indrawing have croup. A careful history and physical examination is the best method to confi rm the diagnosis and to rule out potentially serious alternative disorders such as bacterial tracheitis and other rare causes of upper-airway obstruction. Epinephrine delivered via a nebuliser is eff ective for temporary relief of symptoms of airway obstruction. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, and benefi t is seen in children with all levels of severity of croup, including mild cases.

3399885f297ec40a827955a4ec905b5bc843e396	Opinion formation and disease spreading are among the most studied dynamical processes on complex networks. In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction q of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the statistical properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, as the infection probability increases beyond a threshold, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling q overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies nonmonotonically with q in a large range of the model's parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.
e71f1a5b5e51a5b7917c00209cacbd66c4d4d2f4	Despite biology being 'The study of living organisms' (Proffitt, 2017) , there is no consensus between biologists on the definition of life (Bedau, 2010) . Defining life has challenged and divided biologists and philosophers alike ever since Aristotle proposed the first definition. Emerging fields like synthetic biology and exobiology have rekindled attempts at establishing a definition of life for practical purposes. The question presents many challenges with each attempt thus far leading to unintended implications and strong counterexamples. It is an inherently multidisciplinary challenge with each approach giving wildly varying and often irreconcilable definitions. The given definitions of life are numerous with over 300 definitions published in books and journals. The unique characteristics of the mimivirus, discovered in 2003, and later giant viruses, rekindled the discussion in defining life, indicating other complications in a definition.
eaf1545335540a010cb592f8b54e32a3077a2a83	Severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with extensive lung damage and the presence of infected multinucleated syncytial pneumocytes. The viral and cellular mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia are not well understood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells express the viral Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2-positive neighbouring cells. Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Type-I interferon (IFN)induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell-free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.
43a01463c79029ffe04e8a66376b3a5c4a73cd0a	Haemophagocytic syndrome or haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare disease that is often fatal despite treatment. Haemophagocytic syndrome is caused by a dysregulation in natural killer T-cell function, resulting in activation and proliferation of lymphocytes or histiocytes with uncontrolled haemophagocytosis and cytokine overproduction. The syndrome is characterised by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, liver dysfunction, and hyperferritinaemia. Haemophagocytic syndrome can be either primary, with a genetic aetiology, or secondary, associated with malignancies, autoimmune diseases, or infections. Infections associated with haemophagocytic syndrome are most frequently caused by viruses, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We present a case of EBV-associated haemophagocytic syndrome in a young adult with no known immunosuppression. We briefl y review haemophagocytic syndrome and then discuss its associated infections, particularly EBV and other herpes viruses, HIV, infl uenza, parvovirus, and hepatitis viruses, as well as bacterial, fungal, and parasitic organisms.

In this paper we analyze the Twitter narratives around this decision making by applying a dynamic topic model to COVID-19 related tweets by U.S. Governors and Presidential cabinet members. We use a network Hawkes binomial topic model to track evolving sub-topics around risk, testing and treatment. We also construct influence networks amongst government officials using Granger causality inferred from the network Hawkes process.
cf1ced6a51226d0be3ad86be854e2903c459a434	The Ebola outbreak highlighted the challenge of health security and particularly of how best to give frontline workers the knowledge, confidence and competence to respond effectively. The goal was to develop a tool to improve infection prevention and control through local capacity building within the context of an emergency response. The research showed that digital technology could be a powerful 'force multiplier' allowing much greater access to high fidelity training during an outbreak and keeping it current as protocols evolved or new safety critical steps were identified. Tailoring training to the local context was crucial to its relevance and accessibility. This initiative used a novel approach to the development of the training tool -ebuddi. It used agile development to co-create the tool with active participation of local communities. A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance. In the longer term it may have the potential to improve compliance with International Health Regulations, be adapted for future emergencies, and contribute to global health security.
83dbda3aef0f361b7466dbeab232972d6ea9d271	Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is responsible for SARS infection. Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV encapsidates the viral RNA and plays an important role in virus particle assembly and release. In this study, the N protein of SARS-CoV was found to associate with B23, a phosphoprotein in nucleolus, in vitro and in vivo. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acid residues 175-210, which included a serine/arginine (SR)-rich domain. In vitro phosphorylation assay showed that the N protein inhibited the B23 phosphorylation at Thr199.

The SPHERE-HF trial will include 80 patients treated with mirabegron or placebo for 16 weeks. The main outcome is the change in PVR. Secondary outcomes include changes in RV performance, clinical status, NT-proBNP levels, and additional pulmonary hemodynamic parameters.
abb9dc923ccb9d79e77e730b3cb984fcb0d1439f	The coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2, has posed serious 15 threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt 16 development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this study, we firstly verified that 17 SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high 18 membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) 19 sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased α-helicity 20 and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 21 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed 22 IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S 23 protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the 24 SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) 25 of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid 26 motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have 27 provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the 28 design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step. 29 30
85e682cd231ddfde0c8ecbd6642c55b5921c5366	Data used for modelling the household transmission of infectious diseases, such as influenza, have inherent multilevel structures and correlated property, which make the widely used conventional infectious disease transmission models (including the Greenwood model and the Reed-Frost model) not directly applicable within the context of a household (due to the crowded domestic condition or socioeconomic status of the household). Thus, at the household level, the effects resulting from individual-level factors, such as vaccination, may be confounded or modified in some way. We proposed the Bayesian hierarchical randomeffects (random intercepts and random slopes) model under the context of generalised linear model to capture heterogeneity and variation on the individual, generation, and household levels. It was applied to empirical surveillance data on the influenza epidemic in Taiwan. The parameters of interest were estimated by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method in conjunction with the Bayesian directed acyclic graphical models. Comparisons between models were made using the deviance information criterion. Based on the result of the random-slope Bayesian hierarchical method under the context of the Reed-Frost transmission model, the regression coefficient regarding the protective effect of vaccination varied statistically significantly from household to household. The result of such a heterogeneity was robust to the use of different prior distributions (including non-informative, sceptical, and enthusiastic ones). By integrating out the uncertainty of the parameters of the posterior distribution, the predictive distribution was computed to forecast the number of influenza cases allowing for random-household effect.

ad96f08e6f4241b366f85f49020e205a2dd12410	The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a severe, international shortage of N95 2 respirators, which are essential to protect healthcare providers from infection. Given the 3 contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means 4 of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be 5 effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without 6 impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 7 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work we describe a 8 microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in 9 healthcare systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass 10 containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1100W 11 commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and 12 reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology 13 against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we 14 report an average 6-log 10 plaque forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log 10 15 PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single three-minute microwave treatment. Notably, 16 quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of 17 microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective 18 decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need. 19 
50bc887859439b9448360f00fb513d3752a5eb01	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) participates in adipocyte differentiation and maintenance, including the promotion of lipid storage in mammals. In the present study, 3 duck PPARγ small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression plasmids were constructed to investigate the effect of downregulating the expression of PPARγ on adipogenesis and fat accumulation in ducks. The results indicate that the 3 siRNA specific for conserved regions of PPARγ can effectively inhibit expression of PPARγ. It was demonstrated that the expression of lipoprotein lipase and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein in duck adipose tissue is repressed when the expression of PPARγ is downregulated by siRNA. At the same time, the weight of abdominal fat at 21 and 35 d of age is decreased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with the control. However, the triglyceride levels in serum and muscle are not affected when the mRNA of PPARγ is repressed. The current study indicates that the suppression of PPARγ reduces abdominal fat deposition and regulates adipogenesis in ducks.
0c4f848837c2e8eaf750682d4195cc9076d0cef5	Though scantly investigated, Leishmania infantum infection and clinical cases of leishmaniasis in cats have been recently reported in several countries of the Mediterranean basin, with large variability in prevalence data. A major limitation in the comparability of the data available is attributed to the differences in diagnostic techniques employed and cat populations sampled. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of L. infantum infection in owned cats across Italy by serological and molecular tests and the identification of potential risk factors. Blood samples from 2,659 cats from northern (n = 1,543), central (n = 471) and southern (n = 645) Italy were tested for antibodies against L. infantum, by an immunofluorescence antibody test and for the parasites' DNA, by real-time PCR. Samples were additionally screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNAs. An overall cumulative L. infantum prevalence of 3.9% was recorded by serology (3.3%) and/or qPCR (0.8%), with a higher rate (10.5%) in southern Italy. The risk of L. infantum infection in cats was significantly associated to the geographical areas (South vs North and Centre; p<0.0001), age class (from 19 months to 6 years old vs �18 months old, p = 0.0003), neutering status (not neutered vs neutered, p = 0.0028) and FIV infection (p = 0.0051).Though the role of cats in the epidemiology of L. infantum is still debated, our findings indicate that cats are exposed to and/or infected by this protozoan, mainly in endemic regions of Italy. Hence, a standardization of procedures for a prompt diagnosis of L. infantum infection in cats and for screening cat population is crucial for a better understanding of the epidemiology of feline leishmaniasis, and of the potential role of cats in the transmission cycle of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially fatal parasitic disease, which is caused by Leishmania infantum. Its distribution is associated with the occurrence of the sand fly vectors and reservoir hosts. Since L. infantum infection can occur in cats with clinical or subclinical outcomes, the role of cats in the epidemiology of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis needs to be thoroughly assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and associated risk factors for infection with L. infantum in a large subset of cats across Italy, a known endemic area with records of human cases of visceral leishmaniasis. Serum and blood samples from 2,659 cats from northern (n = 1,543), central (n = 471) and southern (n = 645) Italy were tested for antibodies against L. infantum and parasites' DNA, respectively. A cumulative L. infantum prevalence of 3.9% was recorded by serology (3.3%) and/ or real-time PCR (0.8%). The risk of L. infantum infection in cats was associated to the geographical areas, age class, neutering status and feline immunodeficiency virus infection. These findings reveal that cats are exposed to and/or infected by this protozoan across the country, warranting further investigation to assess their role in the epidemiology of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis to refine surveillance and prevention strategies against this veterinary and medically important ailment.

8a84509853b6b0d1306753cda0be31fdb8d6d58e	In 2014, A novel tick-borne virus of the genus Flavivirus was first reported from the Mogiana region in Brazil. This virus was named the Mogiana tick virus (MGTV). Later, MGTV was also named as Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), Kindia tick virus (KDTV), Guangxi tick virus (GXTV) etc. In the present study, we used small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to detect viruses in ticks and detected MGTV in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks, which had been captured in Yunnan province of China in the year of 2016. The fulllength genome sequence of a new MGTV strain Yunnan2016 (GenBank: MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100) was obtained and recommended to be included into the NCBI RefSeq database for the future studies of MGTV. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that viruses named MGTV, JMTV, KDTV and GXTV are monophyletic: the MGTV group (lineage) of viruses. We show, for the first time, that 5′ and 3′ sRNAs can be used to obtain full-length sequences of the 5' and 3' ends of, but not limited to genome sequences of RNA viruses. And we proved the feasibility of using the sRNA-seq based method for the detection of viruses in a sample containing miniscule RNA.

We describe the brief details of interaction among the bats and unknown hosts, then among the peoples and the infections reservoir (seafood market). The seafood marked are considered the main source of infection when the bats and the unknown hosts (may be wild animals) leaves the infection there. The purchasing of items from the seafood market by peoples have the ability to infect either asymptomatically or symptomatically. We reduced the model with the assumptions that the seafood market has enough source of infection that can be effective to infect people. We present the mathematical results of the model and then formulate a fractional model. We consider the available infection cases for January 21, 2020, till January 28, 2020 and parameterized the model. We compute the basic reproduction number for the data is R 0 % 2:4829. The fractional model is then solved numerically by presenting many graphical results, which can be helpful for the infection minimization. Ó 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

60cd8a2169f79423f22c91678fc76cf5bb216ef5	Background: Treatments for autoimmune diseases aim to dampen autoreactivity while preserving normal immune function. In CD4 + T cells, the transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 is a dispensable transcription factor for T cell development and response to primary infection, but promotes expression of target genes, including Il2 and Ifng, under conditions of antigen reencounter. As a result, they are more strongly expressed upon secondary stimulation. Such repeated antigen encounters occur in memory recall responses, in autoimmunity where self-antigen can be recognized multiple times, and in chronic infection where foreign antigen is persistent. Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that Oct1 loss would protect animals from autoimmunity but maintain normal responses to pathogens in the CNS. Objective: We used a conditional mouse Oct1 (Pou2f1) allele and a CD4-Cre driver to determine the effect of T cellspecific Oct1 loss on autoimmune-and viral-induced neuroinflammation using an autoantigen-driven EAE model of autoimmunity and a JHMV model of viral infection. Results: Oct1 conditional deletion mitigated clinical scores and reduced infiltrating T cells and cytokine production in the EAE model. Consistently, Oct1-deficient CD4 + T cells stimulated in vitro showed increased expression of markers associated with T cell anergy, particularly in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. In contrast, anti-viral T cell effector functions are intact in the absence of Oct1, with no changes in neuroinflammation, infiltrating T cells or cytokine production. Conclusion: Our findings uncover a significant difference between the effect of Oct1 loss on autoimmune and antipathogen responses, which potentially could be exploited for therapeutic benefit.
b1604804e454bd1e651a64a6a1eebaebb406babf	The 2015-2016 emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, and recognition that ZIKV 15 infection during pregnancy can result in birth defects, revealed a need for small animal models to 16 study ZIKV pathogenic mechanisms and evaluate candidate vaccines and antivirals. Mice would 17 be an attractive system for such studies, but ZIKV replicates poorly in laboratory mice because it 18 fails to antagonize murine STAT2 and STING. To address this, most ZIKV pathogenesis studies 19 have used mice with impaired interferon signaling (e.g. Ifnar1 -/or treatment with IFNAR1-blocking 20 antibodies). However, using mice with severe defects in innate antiviral signaling confounds 21 studies of viral pathogenic mechanisms. Collaborative Cross (CC) mice have proven to be a 22 valuable system for developing new mouse pathogenesis models for viral infections that are not 23 well modeled in conventional laboratory mouse lines. To test whether CC mice could provide an 24 immune-competent model for ZIKV pathogenesis, we infected CC lines with ZIKV and assessed 25 weight loss, viremia, and production of neutralizing antibodies. We tested 21 CC lines (CC001, 26

Markets need demand stimulation to achieve full use of resources, argues Krugman, a Keynesian economist. Neoclassical economists have been warning that expansionary macroeconomic policies are not only useless but can even be harmful (e.g. Phelps). These stark differences in the evaluation of economic policy proposals are deeply rooted in their underlying microeconomic reasoning, in the theories of the motivation and behaviour of economic agents as investors, workers, consumers and speculators as well as their interactions. The claim of missing micro-foundations in Keynes's theory is false. In contrast, recent fi ndings of behavioural economics have strongly confi rmed Keynes's micro-foundations that lead to his macroeconomic conclusions.
49a9a8769ece770dba1c78176dfe4264e51fad4b	Macrodomains constitute a conserved fold widely distributed that is not only able to bind ADp-ribose in its free and protein-linked forms but also can catalyse the hydrolysis of the latter. they are involved in the regulation of important cellular processes, such as signalling, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and in host-virus response, and for this, they are considered as promising therapeutic targets to slow tumour progression and viral pathogenesis. Although extensive work has been carried out with them, including their classification into six distinct phylogenetically clades, little is known on bacterial macrodomains, especially if these latter are able to remove poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) from PARylated proteins, activity that only has been confirmed in human TARG1 (C6orf130) protein. To extend this limited knowledge, we demonstrate, after a comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis, that Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 (FmTARG1) is the first bacterial macrodomain shown to have high catalytic efficiency towards O-acyl-ADP-ribose, even more than hTARG1, and towards mono-and poly(ADPribosyl)ated proteins. Surprisingly, FmTARG1 gene is also inserted into a unique operonic context, only shared by the distantly related Fusobacterium perfoetens ATCC 29250 macrodomain, which include an immunity protein 51 domain, typical of bacterial polymorphic toxin systems. Macrodomains constitute a unique conserved 130-190 amino acids three-layered α/β/α sandwich fold widely distributed throughout the phylogenetic scale. They exert a regulatory influence on cellular signalling, transcription, DNA repair, genomic stability, telomere dynamics, necrosis and apoptosis, in addition to cell differentiation and proliferation 1 . They are also involved in different aspects of posttranslational protein modification of the ADP-ribosylation signalling pathway, including reading, erasing, and modulating, in combination with two other important NAD + -using protein families, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and sirtuins 2-9 . To carry out such a plethora of functions, macrodomains not only bind ADP-ribose (ADPr) in its free and protein-linked forms, but also related ligands, such as O-acyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr), and even unconnected ones, such as poly(A) or G-quadruplex sequences 1 . In addition, they could also catalyse the hydrolysis of the 2′,1′′-O-glycosidic ribose-ribose bond in poly(ADP-ribose)-modified proteins (also called de-PARylation), the protein-mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) ester bond (de-MARylation), or the acyl-ADPr ester (deacylation) 10-14 . Macrodomains have been phylogenetically subdivided into six distinct clades 1,14 . MacroD-type clade is the most studied and comprises several distinct proteins ranging from mono-(ADP-ribosyl) hydrolases and OAADPr deacetylases, such as human MacroD1 and MacroD2 15 , Oceanobacillus iheyensis MacroD (OiMacroD) 14 and E. coli YmdB 16 , to poly(A) binding modules, such as GDAP2, a highly conserved protein found from plants to humans with a lipid-binding SEC14 domain at the C terminus 17 . Another class characterized by strong binding to ADP-ribosylated proteins without catalytic activity is the MacroH2A-type clade, which include the epigenetic tumour suppressor MacroH2A 18,19 , and the macrodomains from multidomain human PARP9, PARP14, and PARP15, which are involved in the regulation of cell migration associated with lymphoma (PARP9 and PARP14) 20 , in tumour suppression (PARP15) 21 and in the host-virus response (PARP14 and PARP15) 22 . Macrodomain-containing proteins from Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae virus families have also been identified as a separate clade 23,24 , as a part of the multidomain nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3), which is involved in host protein recruitment and viral replication 25 . These macrodomains, also known as X domain or Mac1, are present in several (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. hepatitis E virus, SARS coronavirus, human coronavirus HCoV 229E, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and Chikungunya virus) and possess broad hydrolase activity towards mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins (PARP15, PARP14 and PARP10) 26 , but only weak activity towards PAR automodified PARP1 27 and ADP-ribose-1′′-phosphate 28-30 . In addition, the nsP3 proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other β-coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013) contain a non-conserved region that follows the X domain (or Mac 1) with two additional macrodomains, Mac2 and Mac3, formerly known as SUD-N and SUD-M 25 , respectively. Mac2 and Mac3 do not bind or hydrolyse ADP-ribose, but do bind G quadruplexes 24,31 . However, while Mac2 has been seen to be dispensable for the SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex, Mac3 is essential for such processes, even though it is not conserved in all the coronaviruses 31 . Thus, viral macrodomains seem to be critical for viral pathogenesis and evasion of the host immune response, making them an important target for top-rated pathogens that are in need for vaccine development, such as Chikungunya virus 27 . Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARGs) form another diverged clade, which were recognized as macrodomains only after their seven-stranded mixed β-sheet sandwiched by a five α-helices structure with the PARG-specific GGGX (6-8) QEE catalytic motif within loop 1 was determined both in bacteria and human 32,33 . These enzymes release oligo-or poly(ADPr) fragments from PARylated proteins, being predominantly exoglycohydrolases with only minor contributions to debranching PAR polymers 34 . On the other hand, the Macro-2 type clade groups important and ubiquitous cellular processing macrodomain enzymes involved in the tRNA splicing pathway, which catalyses the conversion of ADP-ribose-1′′-phosphate (Appr-1′′-p) to ADP-ribose 35 , with no de-MARylating activity 36 . Their only studied representative is the hypothetical Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 204508/S288c YMR087W protein (UniProt code YMX7_YEAST) 35 . By contrast, the YBR022W macrodomain protein of the same yeast strain (now named POA1) not only converts Appr-1′′-p to ADP-ribose, being responsible for ∼90% of Appr1p processing activity in yeast extracts, but also produces de-MARylation 37 . These differences in activity could be related to the fact that POA1 belongs to a different macrodomain clade, the ALC1 clade, thus named for the presence in it of the chromatin remodeler ALC1 (amplified in liver cancer 1) protein 38 , and whose macrodomain binds to sites of DNA damage by sensing PARP1-generated PAR 39 . Belonging to the same clade is the Streptomyces coelicolor SCO6735 macrodomain protein, which hydrolyses glutamate-linked protein mono-ADP-ribosylation, and whose depletion significantly increases the production of the antibiotic actinorhodin in S. coelicolor 40 . Interestingly, a unique class of macrodomains with DNA ADP-ribosyl glycohydrolase activity, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Thermus aquaticus DarG proteins, could also be included in this clade. These last proteins reverse the thymidine base-specific ADP-ribosylation caused by the corresponding DarT toxins, a new class of DNA ADP-ribosyl transferases 41 . These DarG proteins are structurally most similar to metazoan TARG1 (terminal ADPr protein glycohydrolase1, also known as OARD1 or C6orf130) proteins, but with an active site mostly positively charged to facilitate the binding of their negatively charged ssDNA substrate 41 . Of note, full-length DarG seems to inhibit DarT through a protein-protein interaction, providing another layer of DarT regulation, in addition to its macrodomain hydrolytic activity 41 . This mechanism of DarT-DarG interaction has some parallelism with that recently described for the bifunctional immunity protein Tri1, an ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, which protects the essential bacterial tubulin-like protein FtsZ against the ADP-ribosylating toxin Tre1 42 . Interestingly, the above-described human TARG1 (hTARG1) is the only known macrodomain able to hydrolyse OAADPr, MARylated proteins 10 , and the ribose-acceptor bond of PAR-modified PARP1, removing the entire PAR chain en bloc 12 . Its catalytic lysine residue forms a covalent intermediate with the ribose ring through an Amadori rearrangement mechanism, followed by aspartic acid-mediated hydrolysis 12 . Surprisingly, although this special class of macrodomain containing all three activities has been described in some bacteria as a possible alternative mechanism for reversing protein ADP-ribosylation 2 , they have not previously been characterized. The present work presents a comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis of putative TARG1 proteins in bacterial organisms to better understand their distribution. We have focused our research on Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 because of its sequence identity with human TARG1, being the first protein ever characterised from this microorganism. Interestingly, we show that such an enzyme was the first bacterial macrodomain able to remove the PAR polymer, confirming this unique feature of TARG1-type macrodomains compared with MacroD-type macrodomains. In addition, the operonic structure in which FmTARG1 gene is inserted is also unique in nature and is only shared with the distantly related microorganism F. perfoetens ATCC 29250.
a61e707ef1a808123b3c6f542a79373d4315d603	Cellular immune response plays an important role in antiviral immunity. In our previous study, immunization of mice with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) spike (S) DNA vaccine could induce both humoral and cellular immunity in response to a pool of entire overlapping S peptides. Identification of functional dominant epitopes in SARS CoV S protein for T cells is crucial for further understanding of cellular immune responses elicited by SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. In present study, mice were immunized with SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. Subsequently, a pool of 17-19 mers overlapped SARS CoV S peptides, which served as immunogens, were scanned to identify the specific epitopes for T cells. Two H-2 d restricted CD4 + T epitopes, N60 (S435-444) and P152 (S1111-1127), and two H-2 d restricted CD8 + T cell epitopes, N50 (S365-374) and P141 (S1031-1047) were identified by three different methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). The dominant CD4 + T cell epitope (N60) and CD8 + T cell epitope (N50) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV S protein, which mediated virus combining and fusing to susceptible cells. Importantly, our novel finding is that mice primed with SARS S DNA vaccine and boosted with T cell epitopes (N50 and N60) could promote antigen specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell immune responses. Our study provides valuable information for the design of vaccine for SARS study.

f15f954b3df2366f566ffc78bc8ca57dd0ae6be8	The COVID-19 outbreak has caused over 1.7 million (still increasing) confirmed cases globally as of April 10th, 2020. The levels of spread and severity of the virus lead to a wide-spread political and economic turmoil. We believe that two critical contributing factors need to be taken into account by the authorities to make effective decisions for controlling the spread of the virus: (i ) being familiar with the most effective controlling measures and (ii ) having a mathematical model to predict the spread of the virus. In this study, we provided information regarding both of these crucial factors. First, we investigated the importance of different measures such as quarantine, isolation, face mask, social distancing, etc. in controlling the virus in various countries. We then present a mathematical model to predict the spread of the virus in different countries. Our prediction shows an excellent match with the actual data up to now.

Understanding the dynamics of the IgOme and how the diversity and specificities of serum antibodies change in response to disease and maintenance of homeostasis can directly impact the ability to design and develop novel vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. Here we review both direct and indirect methodologies that are being developed to map the complexity and specificities of the antibodies in polyclonal serum -the IgOme. (J.M. Gershoni).

096dd60c52a31f8a7dacbc5cbbe0d5f8cb1ace26	Pulmonary complications are major causes of morbidity and mortality after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We hypothesise that elevated exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels early after HSCT in children are predictive for pulmonary complications. The present prospective study included 30 children (age, 4-18 years) before HSCT. FeNO levels were evaluated 10 days before transplant, at day 0, day +28 and day +60 after HSCT. During the follow-up period until day +100, pulmonary complications and lung function were assessed. Before HSCT, the mean FeNO levels were comparable in children with or without post-transplant pulmonary complications. However, they differed at day 0 and day +28 with a mean of 7 (±1.95) and 13 (±3.44) ppb at day 0 and a mean of 13 (±3.44) and 14 (±3.57) ppb at day +28, respectively. Conclusion: Children with pulmonary complications after day +28 have higher mean FeNO levels 28 days after HSCT than children without later pulmonary complications. Therefore, FeNO could be an important diagnostic tool for hyperinflammatory response in bronchial epithelium after paediatric HSCT.
6f4481b8604e37b866ae685cc5f9a11b50d6b39c	Respiratory tract infections (RTI) can take a serious course under immunosuppression. Data on the impact of the underlying pathogens are still controversial. Samples from the upper (n = 322) and lower RT (n = 169) were collected from 136 children and 355 adults; 225 among them have been immunocompromised patients. Exclusion criteria were presence of relevant cultivable microorganisms, C-reactive protein > 20 mg/dl, or procalcitonin > 2.0 ng/ml. Samples were tested by PCR for the presence of herpesviruses (HSV-1/-2; VZV; CMV; HHV6; EBV), adenoviruses, bocaviruses, entero-/rhinoviruses (HRV), parechoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses (IV), parainfluenza viruses as well as for pneumoviruses (HMPV and RSV), and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, M.p.; Chlamydia pneumoniae, C.p.). Viral/bacterial genome equivalents were detected in more than two-thirds of specimens. Under immunosuppression, herpesviruses (EBV 30.9%/14.6%, p < 0.001; CMV 19.6%/ 7.9%, p < 0.001; HSV-1: 14.2%/7.1%, p = 0.012) were frequently observed, mainly through their reactivation in adults. Immunocompromised adults tended to present a higher RSV prevalence (6.4%/2.4%, p = 0.078). Immunocompetent patients were more frequently tested positive for IV (15.0%/5.8%, p = 0.001) and M.p. (6.4%/0.4%, p < 0.001), probably biased due to the influenza pandemic of 2009 and an M.p. epidemic in 2011. About 41.8% of samples were positive for a single pathogen, and among them EBV (19.9%) was most prevalent followed by HRV (18.2%) and IV (16.6%). HSV-2 and C.p. were not found. Marked seasonal effects were observed for HRV, IV, and RSV. Differences in pathogen prevalence were demonstrated between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The exact contribution of some herpesviruses to the development of RTI remains unclear.
903b3e250054b4db6ae2ddaa0abd8949c9bb80a1	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 is spreading fast and is affecting the clinical workers at much higher risk than the general population. Little is known about COVID-19 effect on pregnant women; however, the emerging evidence suggests they may be at high risk of asymptomatic disease. In light of projected shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), there is an aggressive attempt at conservation. In obstetrics, the guidelines on PPE use are controversial and differ among hospitals, globally, as well as nationally. The centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommend using N95 respirators, which are respirators that offer a higher level of protection instead of a facemask for when performing or present for an aerosolgenerating procedures (AGP). However, the second stage of labor is not considered an AGP. The second stage of labor can last up to 4 hours. During that time, labor and delivery personnel is in close contact to patients, who are exerting extreme effort during and frequently blow out their breath, cough, shout, and vomit, all of which put the health care team at risk, considering that COVID-19 transmission occurs through aerosol generated by coughing and sneezing. The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not provide clarification on the use of N95 during the second stage. We recommend that labor and delivery personnel have the utmost caution and be granted the protection they need to protect themselves and other patients. This includes providing labor and delivery personnel full PPE including N95 for the second stage of labor. This is critical to ensure the adequate protection for health care workers and to prevent spread to other health care workers and patients. • Second stage of labor exposes providers to aerosol. • COVID-19 risk during second stage of labor is high. • N95 should be used during second stage of labor.
66e863b67f8ef14a8a953841b6ddf7a2cefaf696	We introduce a method for estimating incidence curves of several co-circulating infectious pathogens, where each infection has its own probabilities of particular symptom profiles. Our deconvolution method utilizes weekly surveillance data on symptoms from a defined population as well as additional data on symptoms from a sample of virologically confirmed infectious episodes. We illustrate this method by numerical simulations and by using data from a survey conducted on the University of Michigan campus. Last, we describe the data needs to make such estimates accurate.
cfdb6df5cb7902f7dd61306de402f6aa934bbff1	Background: SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, has infected over seven million people world-wide, including two million people in the United States. While many people recover from the virus uneventfully, a subset of patients will require hospital admission, some with intensive care needs including intubation, and mechanical ventilation. To date there is no cure and no vaccine is available. Passive immunotherapy by the transfusion of convalescent plasma donated by COVID-19 recovered patients might be an effective option to combat the virus, especially if used early in the course of disease. Here we report our experience of using convalescent plasma at a tertiary care center in a mid-size, midwestern city that did not experience an overwhelming patient surge. Methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients categorized as having Severe or Life-Threatening disease according to the Mayo Clinic Emergency Access Protocol were screened, consented, and treated with convalescent plasma collected from local donors recovered from COVID-19 infection. Clinical data and outcomes were collected retrospectively. Results: 31 patients were treated, 16 severe patients and 15 life-threatened patients. Overall mortality was 27% (4/31) but only patients with life-threatening disease died. 94% of transfused patients with severe disease avoided escalation to ICU care and mechanical ventilation. 67% of patients with life-threatening disease were able to be extubated. Most transfused patients had a rapid decrease in their respiratory
be26eef28285ced8d2141e36ec9c003f31f8bdae	Objectives: We investigated serum cytokine levels in pediatric patients with pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 virus (H1N1) infection-pneumonia and in pediatric patients with pneumonia but without H1N1 infection, and examined correlations between cytokine levels and clinical/laboratory findings. Methods: Fifty-seven cases of infection by H1N1 were confirmed by RT-PCR and enrolled. Of these 57 cases, 26 had a severe H1N1 infection (group 1), and 31 had a mild H1N1 infection (group 2). Sera from 18 cases with pneumonia without H1N1 infection (group 3) were used as controls. The serum levels of 10 cytokines were determined by multiplex assay. Results: The serum levels of IFN-a, IL-6, and IP-10 were significantly higher in H1N1 infected cases than in group 3, and levels of IL-6 and IP-10 were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2. The level of IL-10 was significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 than in group 2. However, levels of IFN-g and IL-17 were not significantly different between the three groups. IL-1b, IL-4, and MIP-1a were not detectable in most patients. IP-10 and IL-6 levels were found to show negative correlations with lymphocyte count and oxygen saturation. Conclusions: We found higher levels of cytokines (IFN-a, IL-6, IP-10) of innate immunity than those of acquired immunity in pediatric H1N1 infection. Of the cytokines found to be increased in cases with H1N1 infection, IP-10 and IL-6 were found to be correlated with disease severity (lymphopenia and hypoxia). IP-10 and IL-6 may be important markers in pediatric H1N1 infection.
d8fc56afbf92f3b590d5d95e0e6be7e5bbdae859	Fast, cheap and easy to use nucleic acids detection methods are crucial to mitigate adverse impacts caused by various pathogens, and are essential in forensic investigations, food safety monitoring or evolution of infectious diseases. We report here a method based on the α-hemolysin (α-HL) nanopore, working in conjunction to unmodified citrate anion-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), to detect nanomolar concentrations of short single-stranded DNA sequences (ssDNA). The core idea was to use charge neutral peptide nucleic acids (PNA) as hybridization probe for complementary target ssDNAs, and monitor at the single-particle level the PNA-induced aggregation propensity AuNPs during PNA-DNA duplexes formation, by recording ionic current blockades signature of AuNP-α-HL interactions. This approach offers advantages including: (1) a simple to operate platform, producing clear-cut readout signals based on distinct size differences of PNA-induced AuNPs aggregates, in relation to the presence in solution of complementary ssDNAs to the PNA fragments (2) sensitive and selective detection of target ssDNAs (3) specific ssDNA detection in the presence of interference DNA, without sample labeling or signal amplification. The powerful synergy of protein nanopore-based nanoparticle detection and specific PNA-DNA hybridization introduces a new strategy for nucleic acids biosensing with short detection time and label-free operation. Assay designs effective in diagnostic workflow for early detection of pathogen outbreaks, as the recently emerged novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pose serious challenges even for specialized research or public health laboratories, especially in low-income countries. Besides culture and colony counting, or immunological investigations, hybridization assays built around polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategies represent the golden standard when it comes to quantification of disease-specific nucleic acids. The emergence of new technologies such as real time PCR, microfluidics, integrated rapid PCR systems, and massively parallel sequencing devices, facilitated the introduction of new methods enabling effective disease detection. Comprehensive information regarding pros and cons of these methods has been presented elsewhere 1-4 . Despite successes, probing the presence of target sequences carried by exogenous nucleic acids by traditional hybridization assays 5,6 , suffers from serious limitations generated by nonspecific amplification or hybridization, as well as costly infrastructure and complex work. To mitigate such challenges, nanomaterials (e.g., quantum dots, carbon nanotubes) were employed for fluorescence assays of nucleic acids 7-10 while others demonstrated the ability of polyelectrolytemodified capacitive EIS sensors for the label-free detection of DNA hybridization in aqueous buffers 11,12 or silicon nanowire-based field-effect transistors 13 . Single-molecule, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy methods, were also used to detect duplex formation within or between individual DNA strands 14-18 . Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) emerged as nanomaterials with a game-changing potential in the field of nucleic acids detection 19 . Central for traditional colorimetric assays, the crucial observation is that the peak absorbance wavelength of AuNPs is sensitive to the distance between particles. If a target analyte triggers AuNP aggregation, the surface plasmon resonance of individual AuNP particles becomes coupled and shifts the absorbance spectrum, as non-aggregated nanoparticles present a red color, while aggregated nanoparticles appear blue 20 . The first AuNP-based DNA sensor was developed by Mirkin and co-workers, whereby they modified two sets of AuNPs with different single-stranded DNA probes and mixed them with a target DNA. If the target DNA presents sequences complementary to both the probes, it will cause the particles to cross-link by hybridization and aggregate 21 . In another seminal study, only one kind of single-stranded probe DNA was grafted on AuNPs, and it was demonstrated that in the presence of perfectly complementary target DNA, AuNPs aggregated via non-cross-linking DNA hybridization 22 . Others revealed that single-and double-stranded oligonucleotides have different electrostatic properties to protect AuNPs from salt induced aggregation, that can be used for DNA detection without covalent immobilization of DNA onto AuNPs 23-27 . By means of spectroscopy, quasielastic light scattering or isothermal titration calorimetry, interactions between AuNPs and nucleobases 28 or mononucleotides and oligonucleotides 24,29-31 have been characterized in great detail. In a recent review, the applications of gold nanoparticles-based assays as viable alternatives to conventional methods, for detection of infectious diseases, are thoroughly discussed 32 . We sought herein to find a solution for future development of biosensors enabling rapid detection of exogenous ssDNA with high sensitivity, in a cost-effective way. Unlike the colorimetric or spectroscopic assays reviewed before, we resorted to the utilization of a homo-heptameric α-hemolysin (α-HL) protein nanopore 33 working in conjunction with AuNPs and a particular class of artificial genetic polymers, as an approach capable of rapid discrimination of short ssDNAs. Built on a strategy similar to the original Coulter-like counter 34-36 , nanopores emerged as versatile systems for detecting small molecules [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] pathogens 42, 43 , or peptides and proteins [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . With relevance to detecting nucleic acid targets via hybridization-assisted nanopore sensing, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) 56 constitute promising reagents due to their resistance to enzymatic degradation by nucleases and proteases 57 and strong hybridization properties with complementary DNA/RNA targets 58 . The monitoring of PNA-based hybridization with nanopores was shown to be particularly useful for selective miRNA 59 or ds/ssDNA detection 60-66 . In particular, the involvement of PNA in AuNPs-based nanoassembly and assays for DNA detection was reported in pioneering studies [67] [68] [69] [70] . Only a handful of previous studies investigated the utility of α-HL as a sensitive platform for characterizing water-soluble gold nanoclusters with different ligand shell composition 71-74 , whereas others have involved pores manufactured in polymeric membranes in conjunction with AuNPs to detect DNA targets 75 . The strategy at the core of this work was to use resistive pulse sensing through a single α-HL nanopore, to sense and discriminate AuNPs based on their specific PNA-induced surface properties changes and aggregation propensity, closely related to the PNA-target ssDNA hybridization. By virtue of its scalability to a wide range of ssDNA sequences, cost-effectivity, high sensitivity and specificity, this method illustrates a potentially solid alternative for amplification-free, hybridization-based exogenous nucleic acids detection in the field, biotechnological applications or point-of-care units. Reagents. The custom designed peptide nucleic acids (PNA2) were synthesized by and purchased from Panagene Inc., South Korea, and the complementary (HCV) or noncomplementary (H1N1) ssDNAs sequences to PNA2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany (see Table 1 ). Citrate-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a diameter ~ 5 nm, human serum (HS) and other reagents including potassium chloride (KCl), sodium chloride (NaCl), ultra-pure water (DNAase and RNAase free), EDTA, Tris buffer, n-pentane, hexadecane, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and α-hemolysin (α-HL), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. The 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (DPhPC) lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA. Buffer solutions. Depending on the experiment, electrolyte solutions for UV-vis spectral analysis or electrophysiology contained various amounts of salt (0.1 M or 3 M KCl), 1 mM EDTA, buffered in 10 mM Tris at pH = 7.3. All experiments were performed at room temperature ~ 23 °C. Sample preparation. The dried form of ssDNAs samples and PNA2 were dissolved in 1 M NaCl solution in ultra-pure water buffered with TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) at pH = 8.2, to obtain stock solutions of 100 μM and 5 μM concentration, respectively. In order to enhance the solubility of PNA2, small amounts of DMSO (5%

2029674320d4920a281e3309e76c5e8b034f57ab	Mini abstract: This Manuscript provides an overview of how SARS-CoV-2 spreads and survives in the built environment, reviews effective inactivation materials, and offers practical decontamination strategies for front line workers at each stage of transition from wok to home. The question, -how can I keep the people in my household safe?‖ points to a fundamental fear among health care workers and other essential employees. For those on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety regarding virus transmission does not stop at shifts' end. Instead, providers are grappling with how to ensure they do not bring infectious materials home. Few, if any, guidelines exist to advise personnel on how to best limit viral spread to their families, and most focus on how to limit transmission after individuals become infected. In this context, we have endeavored to synthesize scientific evidence, agency guidelines, and best practices from workers in the field, to create a framework for staff returning from work. Decontamination recommendations are based largely on our understanding of how the virus spreads, and how long it persists on various surfaces. This information is extrapolated from several sources including studies on endemic coronavirus 229e (the common cold), MERS-CoV, and recent examination of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infected-cruise ships. Risk mitigation strategies, such as social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment, are based on transmission data, demonstrating spread primarily through inhaling droplets. However, persons may also become infected by transferring virus from contaminated surfaces to mucous membranes 1 . The precise contact time necessary to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is unknown; however, Flu A data suggests that 5 second is enough to transfer approximately 1/3 of virus inoculum 2 . Transmission risk also appears to be highly dependent on the material in question, which has direct implications for workers worried about bringing virus home.

This study was undertaken to look at the spectrum of clinical presentations, therapeutic interventions, and their outcomes and also to evaluate the association of various risk factors with mortality. This was a retrospective study in which the patients admitted with the diagnosis of primary pyomyositis from January 2000 to June 2007 were included. Their demographic details, clinical and laboratory data, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at presentation, treatment instituted, complications encountered, and hospital outcome were recorded. Sixty-seven patients (42 males and 25 females) with a diagnosis of primary pyomyositis were included. Median age at the time of presentation was 37 years (interquartile range=25-50 years). Common presenting symptoms were myalgias [50 (74.62%)] and fever [49 (73.13%)]. Twenty-six patients had underlying predisposing medical conditions. The commonest muscle group involved was iliopsoas muscles in 31 (46.26%) patients. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism isolated from the pus. Twentyeight patients developed sepsis and seven died. On univariate analysis, there was a statistically significant association between higher SOFA score, lower Glasgow coma scale, higher pulse rate, lower blood pressure, raised blood urea, raised serum creatinine, higher serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase, raised total bilirubin at presentation, and development of sepsis during hospital stay with mortality. In our study, the patients were seen almost a decade later than those seen in other studies from the region. Evidence of organ dysfunction at presentation and sepsis was associated with increased mortality.
ec1d83b2c1f75e92defd3ae9f4358b7ca2b682c8	When a mission arrives at a random time and lasts for a duration, it becomes an interesting problem to plan replacement policies according to the health condition and repair history of the operating unit, as the reliability is required at mission time and no replacement can be done preventively during the mission duration. From this viewpoint, this paper proposes that effective replacement policies should be collaborative ones gathering data from time of operations, mission durations, minimal repairs and maintenance triggering approaches. We firstly discuss replacement policies with time of operations and random arrival times of mission durations, model the policies and find optimum replacement times and mission durations to minimize the expected replacement cost rates analytically. Secondly, replacement policies with minimal repairs and mission durations are discussed in a similar analytical way. Furthermore, the maintenance triggering approaches, i.e., replacement first and last, are also considered into respective replacement policies. Numerical examples are illustrated when the arrival time of the mission has a gamma distribution and the failure time of the unit has a Weibull distribution. In addition, simple case illustrations of maintaining the production system in glass factories are given based on the assumed data.
cfe337afa069a02e96adf6894819e7928f8c4534	Background: Acquired myasthenia gravis (AMG) is increasingly recognized in cats, yet information regarding the natural history of the disease, treatment, and outcome including occurrence of immune and spontaneous remission remains limited. Objective: To determine the long-term outcome of cats with AMG without evidence of a cranial mediastinal mass (CMM). Animals: Eight cats diagnosed with AMG without evidence of a CMM. : Retrospective case series. The medical records of cats diagnosed with AMG between 2005 and 2018 from 2 veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed for inclusion. Inclusion criteria consisted of a diagnosis of AMG, thoracic imaging, serum biochemistry including measurement of creatine kinase, and a CBC. Exclusion criteria were the presence of an identifiable CMM, or administration of methimazole or carbimazole.
cc4b3f30afd12f647db263cce832cfd3e244b9ae	Auch in der Corona-Krise schwelen internationale Handelskonfl ikte weiter. So verschärfte die US-Regierung Mitte Mai 2020, mitten in der Corona-Krise, noch einmal die Exportbeschränkungen für Zulieferer des chinesischen Telekommunikationsausrüsters Huawei. Angesichts des dramatischen Nachfrageeinbruchs bei den Automobilherstellern kann deshalb auch nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass Donald Trump seine protektionistische Idee, die Einfuhr von Autos und Autoteilen aus der EU mit Strafzöllen zu belegen, wiederbeleben und damit auch den transatlantischen Handelskonfl ikt neu anfachen könnte. Simulationen zeigen, dass ein solcher Konfl ikt insbesondere bei einer Ausweitung der Zölle auf weitere Sektoren und einer längeren Dauer der deutschen Wirtschaft spürbaren Schaden zufügen könnte.
aabc1ed57100a1b7ad5eea91304536e6ef95aa56	We conducted an epidemiologic investigation among survivors of an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Jordan. A second-trimester stillbirth occurred during the course of an acute respiratory illness that was attributed to MERS-CoV on the basis of exposure history and positive results of MERS-CoV serologic testing. This is the first occurrence of stillbirth during an infection with MERS-CoV and may have bearing upon the surveillance and management of pregnant women in settings of unexplained respiratory illness potentially due to MERS-CoV. Future prospective investigations of MERS-CoV should ascertain pregnancy status and obtain further pregnancy-related data, including biological specimens for confirmatory testing.
92fb7ef8fd16e0c887f2044fe572ae1172b2becf	Free radical reactions play an important role in biological functions of living systems. The balance between oxidants and antioxidants is necessary for the normal homeostasis of cells and organisms. Experimental works demonstrate the role of oxidative stress that is caused by influenza virus as well as the toxic effects of some antiviral drugs. Therefore, antiviral drugs should be characterized by its pro-and antioxidant activity, because it can affect its therapeutic efficiency. The aim of the study was to quantify the antioxidant capacity and propose the mechanism of the antioxidant effect of the antiviral drug Umifenovir (Arbidol ® ). The kinetic chemiluminescence with the 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride + luminol system was used to quantify the antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir relative to the standard compound Trolox. With computer simulation, the reaction scheme and rate constants were proposed. The antioxidant capacity of 0.9 µM Umifenovir (maximum concentration of Umifenovir in blood after oral administration of 200 mg) was as high as 1.65 ± 0.18 µM of Trolox. Thus, the total antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir is comparable to the antioxidant capacity of Trolox. Unlike Trolox, Umifenovir reacts with free radicals in two stages. For Trolox, the free radical scavenging rate constant was k = 2000 nM −1 min. −1 , for Umifenovir k 1 = 300 nM −1 min. −1 , k 2 = 4 nM −1 min. −1 . Slower kinetics of Umifenovir provides the prolonged antioxidant effect when compared to Trolox. This phenomenon can make a serious contribution to the compensation of oxidative stress that is caused by a viral disease and the therapeutic effect of the drug.
9dbe82ddb7f7c9a71d00d87ecb33428dffe245a4	With more than 13 million cases and 570,000 deaths, and with the resulting social upheaval, the COVID-19 pandemic presents one of the greatest challenges ever to the scientific community. It is thus vital to fully understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface and to drive fusion of the viral membrane with cellular membranes, thus allowing transfer of viral RNA to the cytosol. Here we use purified spike glycoprotein protein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein to determine that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid endocytosis following binding to the plasma membrane. Using chemical inhibitors and loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that this cellular entry is through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 first engages the plasma membrane, then rapidly enters the lumen of the endosomal system, strongly suggesting that fusion of the viral membrane occurs with the lumenal membrane of endosomes. This discovery has important implications for the development of chemical probes to reduce or block infection.
c2ee3c7799d8958729d086a079382df438a5a2f9	Background: Bats provide important ecosystem services; however, current evidence supports that they host several zoonotic viruses, including species of the Coronaviridae family. If bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, spillover may occur. Therefore, strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence, while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed. Past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle; however, shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species, which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions. To assess the generalizability of coronavirus shedding seasonality, we sampled hundreds of bats belonging to several species with different life history traits across East Africa at different times of the year. We assessed, via Bayesian modeling, the hypothesis that chiropterans, across species and spatial domains, experience seasonal trends in coronavirus shedding as a function of the reproductive cycle. Results: We found that, beyond spatial, taxonomic, and life history differences, coronavirus shedding is more expected when pups are becoming independent from the dam and that juvenile bats are prone to shed these viruses. Conclusions: These findings could guide policy aimed at the prevention of spillover in limited-resource settings, where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible, by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding. In these periods, contact with bats should be avoided (for example, by impeding or forbidding people access to caves). Our proposed strategy provides an alternative to cullingan ethically questionable practice that may result in higher pathogen levelsand supports the conservation of bats and the delivery of their key ecosystem services.
76d446112561ab0100feb5323f071191e0aa02c6	Background: The objective of our study was to clinically and etiologically investigate acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in Finland. Our study also aimed to evaluate the clinical use of various methods in diagnosing respiratory infections under field conditions and to describe the antimicrobial resistance profile of the main bacterial pathogen(s) found during the study. Methods: A total of 20 case herds having finishing pigs showing acute respiratory symptoms and eight control herds showing no clinical signs suggesting of respiratory problems were enrolled in the study. Researchers visited each herd twice, examining and bleeding 20 pigs per herd. In addition, nasal swab samples were taken from 20 pigs and three pigs per case herd were necropsied during the first visit. Serology was used to detect Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in serum and SIV in the nasal and lung samples. Pathology and bacteriology, including antimicrobial resistance determination, were performed on lung samples obtained from the field necropsies. Results: According to the pathology and bacteriology of the lung samples, APP and Ascaris suum were the main causes of respiratory outbreaks in 14 and three herds respectively, while the clinical signs in three other herds had a miscellaneous etiology. SIV, APP and PCV2 caused concurrent infections in certain herds but they were detected serologically or with PCR also in control herds, suggesting possible subclinical infections. APP was isolated from 16 (80%) case herds. Marked resistance was observed against tetracycline for APP, some resistance was detected against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin and penicillin, and no resistance against florfenicol, enrofloxacin, tulathromycin or tiamulin was found. Serology, even from paired serum samples, gave inconclusive results for acute APP infection diagnosis. Conclusions: APP was the most common cause for acute respiratory outbreaks in our study. SIV, A. suum, PCV2 and certain opportunistic bacteria were also detected during the outbreaks; however, viral pathogens appeared less important than bacteria. Necropsies supplemented with microbiology were the most efficient diagnostic methods in characterizing the studied outbreaks.
7b9e45133c8a6f6c48ec8c5f1f0c01ad0cd1d3ae	Avipoxviruses (APVs) belong to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily of the Poxviridae family. APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, pet and wild birds of many species. APVs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects, particularly mosquitoes and arthropods and are usually named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated. The virus species Fowlpox virus (FWPV) causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low, but in flocks under stress (other diseases, high production) mortality can reach up to 50%. APVs are also major players in viral vaccine vector development for diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Abortive infection in mammalian cells (no production of progeny viruses) and their ability to accommodate multiple gene inserts are some of the characteristics that make APVs promising vaccine vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells conceivably represents a major vaccine bio-safety advantage, molecular mechanisms restricting APVs to certain hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge relating to APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus interactions, diagnostics and disease, and also highlights the use of APVs as recombinant vaccine vectors.
b80201fcb83eeae943d900da79b906f8759dd34e	Research on crisis management has accumulated a vast body of knowledge that has assisted us with comprehending complex business and management phenomena. Yet, the existing studies have not paid sufficient attention to global challenges and sustainable development. We join the current conversation being conducted from the global challenges perspective of crisis management by suggesting that investigating global challenges and sustainable development can advance our collective understanding of crisis management in important ways. This article has three general objectives. First, we show that crisis management has been a long-standing issue in business and management research and provide an overview of the puzzles that informed and motivated this focussed issue. Second, we highlight the key insights and contributions made by the papers included in this focussed issue by reviewing their theoretical underpinnings, methodological approaches, and findings. Finally, we invite scholars to join the debate in order to move this important crisis management research agenda forward by tackling global challenges with the goal of achieving sustainable development.
2e6000c1c817dd97859071c3de51beb4ef9d62f1	In this paper, we suggest a novel method to help learners find relevant open educational videos to master skills demanded on the labour market. We have built a prototype, which 1) applies text classification and text mining methods on job vacancy announcements to match jobs and their required skills; 2) predicts the quality of videos; and 3) creates an open educational video recommender system to suggest personalized learning content to learners. For the first evaluation of this prototype we focused on the area of data science related jobs. Our prototype was evaluated by in-depth, semi-structured interviews. 15 subject matter experts provided feedback to assess how our recommender prototype performs in terms of its objectives, logic, and contribution to learning. More than 250 videos were recommended, and 82.8% of these recommendations were treated as useful by the interviewees. Moreover, interviews revealed that our personalized video recommender system, has the potential to improve the learning experience.
feff47ed01f282544475801f279722e90cf1aa60	We report the successful management of a patient with severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit complicated by secondary catheter-related infection of Candida glabrata. We are discussing some of the clinical challenges and the pitfalls in molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, including the fact that a positive PCR result may not always reflect infectiousness.
04b21a29327e8a2f78a9fb717e87d41b2a6cdc1c	The rapid global spread of the novel, pathogenic, SARS-CoV-2 causing the severe acute respiratory disease COVID-19, becomes a major health problem worldwide and pose the need for international predictive programs. Given the lack of both specific drugs and an efficient preventive vaccine, the expectation that the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate might decrease in temperate regions during summer, dominated in the social scene. Here, we attempted a prediction of the worldwide spread of the infections based on climatic data, expressed by bioclimatic variables. The calculated probability maps shown that potential areas of infection follow a shift from the Tropical to Temperate and Mediterranean Bioclimatic regions. Maps show an increased probability of infections in Europe, followed by an expansion covering areas of the Middle East and Northern Africa, as well as Eastern coastal areas of North America, South-Eastern coastal areas of Latin America and two areas of Southern Australia. Our approach may, therefore, be of value for the incorporation of climatic influences in the design and implementation of public health policies. Maps are available (constantly updated) at https://navaak.shinyapps.io/CVRisk/.
7416c523189beff122c97c6d554e3c63a1b5aed2	The COVID-19 pandemic is straining public health systems worldwide and major non-35 pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to slow its spread 1-4 . During the initial phase 36 of the outbreak the spread was primarily determined by human mobility 5,6 . Yet empirical evidence 37 on the effect of key geographic factors on local epidemic spread is lacking 7 . We analyse highly-38 resolved spatial variables for cities in China together with case count data in order to investigate 39 the role of climate, urbanization, and variation in interventions across China. Here we show that 40 the epidemic intensity of COVID-19 is strongly shaped by crowding, such that epidemics in dense 41 cities are more spread out through time, and denser cities have larger total incidence. Observed 42 differences in epidemic intensity are well captured by a metapopulation model of COVID-19 that 43 explicitly accounts for spatial hierarchies. Densely-populated cities worldwide may experience more 44 prolonged epidemics. Whilst stringent interventions can shorten the time length of these local 45 epidemics, although these may be difficult to implement in many affected settings. 46 47 Main text 63 China provides richly detailed epidemiological time series 2,17,18 across a wide range of geographic 64 contexts, hence the epidemic there provides an opportunity to evaluate the role of factors in shaping the
742e4f9080c4ff3a0211c8ef20dfb8594b911f69	Great Lakes tributaries are known to deliver waterborne pathogens from a host of sources. To examine the hydrologic, land cover, and seasonal patterns of waterborne pathogens (i.e. protozoa (2), pathogenic bacteria (4) human viruses, (8) and bovine viruses (8)) eight rivers were monitored in the Great Lakes Basin over 29 months from February 2011 to June 2013. Sampling locations represented a wide variety of land cover classes from urban to agriculture to forest. A custom automated pathogen sampler was deployed at eight sampling locations which provided unattended, flow-weighted, large-volume (120 e1630 L) sampling. Human and bovine viruses and pathogenic bacteria were detected by real-time qPCR in 16%, 14%, and 1.4% of 290 samples collected while protozoa were never detected. The most frequently detected pathogens were: bovine polyomavirus (11%), and human adenovirus C, D, F (9%). Human and bovine viruses were present in 16.9% and 14.8% of runoff-event samples (n ¼ 189) resulting from precipitation and snowmelt, and 13.9% and 12.9% of low-flow samples (n ¼ 101), respectively, indicating multiple delivery mechanisms could be influential. Data indicated human and bovine virus prevalence was different depending on land cover within the watershed. Occurrence, concentration, and flux of human viruses were greatest in samples from the three sampling locations with greater than 25% urban influence than those with less than 25% urban influence. Similarly, occurrence, concentration, and flux of bovine viruses were greatest in samples from the two sampling locations with greater than 50 cattle/km 2 than those with less than 50 cattle/km 2 . In seasonal analysis, human and bovine viruses occurred more frequently in spring and winter seasons than during the fall and summer. Concentration, occurrence, and flux in the context of hydrologic condition, seasonality, and land use must be considered for each watershed individually to develop effective watershed management strategies for pathogen reduction.

The guidance document provides an introduction to epidemiological studies and illustrates the typical biases of the different epidemiological study designs. It describes key epidemiological concepts relevant for evidence appraisal. Regarding study reliability, measures of association, exposure assessment, statistical inferences, systematic error and effect modification are explained. Regarding study relevance, the guidance describes the concept of external validity. The principles of appraising epidemiological studies are illustrated, and an overview of Risk of Bias (RoB) tools is given. A decision tree is developed to assist in the selection of the appropriate Risk of Bias tool, depending on study question, population and design. The customisation of the study appraisal process is explained, detailing the use of RoB tools and assessing the risk of bias in the body of evidence. Several examples of appraising experimental and observational studies using a Risk of Bias tool are annexed to the document to illustrate the application of the approach. This document constitutes a draft that will be applied in EFSA's assessments during a 1-year pilot phase and be revised and complemented as necessary. Before finalisation of the document, a public consultation will be launched.
291d175444961b9f4f80ba2a726648687ed393e5	Objective: This study was designed for the characterization and establishment of antibiotic susceptibility profiles of non-fermentative gram negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in a tertiary care hospital of Nepal. Results: A total of 402 non-fermentative gram negative bacteria was isolated in 1486 culture-positive cases from 6216 different clinical samples obtained from hospitalized patients. Among total non-fermentative gram negative bacterial isolates, the highest number was recovered from specimens collected from lower respiratory tract infections (n = 173, 43.0%) of hospitalized patients followed by pus/swab samples (n = 99, 24.6%) and urinary tract infections (n = 49, 12.2%). The most common non-fermentative gram negative bacteria identified were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 177, 44.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 161, 40.1%) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (n = 33, 8.2%). These bacterial isolates exhibited a higher rate of insusceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. On the other hand, all the isolates of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were completely susceptible to colistin sulfate and polymyxin B. Among total isolates, 78.1% (n = 314) were multidrug-resistant with a high rate of multidrugresistant among A. baumannii (91.0%).
cf937b0c24736decd005c1e457ca0540dcc0628b	| Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated not only by genomic enhancers and promoters, but also by covalent modifications added to both chromatin and RNAs. Whereas cellular gene expression may be either enhanced or inhibited by specific epigenetic modifications deposited on histones (in particular, histone H3), these epigenetic modifications can also repress viral gene expression, potentially functioning as a potent antiviral innate immune response in DNA virus-infected cells. However, viruses have evolved countermeasures that prevent the epigenetic silencing of their genes during lytic replication, and they can also take advantage of epigenetic silencing to establish latent infections. By contrast, the various covalent modifications added to RNAs, termed epitranscriptomic modifications, can positively regulate mRNA translation and/or stability, and both DNA and RNA viruses have evolved to utilize epitranscriptomic modifications as a means to maximize viral gene expression. As a consequence, both chromatin and RNA modifications could serve as novel targets for the development of antivirals. In this Review, we discuss how host epigenetic and epitranscriptomic processes regulate viral gene expression at the levels of chromatin and RNA function, respectively, and explore how viruses modify, avoid or utilize these processes in order to regulate viral gene expression.
4630378a0db8bae16b58ac19b512f9fffb0fc98f	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an important pathogen that has a significant economic impact on the swine industry by imposing a high rate of mortality in suckling piglets. However, limited information on the productivity values of gilts and sows infected with PEDV is available. Here, we evaluate the productivity index in gilts and sows during the 1year period before (19
3f1a42a65b20b1ba6e211e411f459cd8ea1af14b	Background: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that patients with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection may be at risk of severe disease complications when they also have comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and/or asthma. However, the prevalence of these co-existing medical conditions in severe CHIKV cases has not been systematically reported. Objective: The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the prevalence of chronic comorbidities in CHIKV and evaluate their possible contributions to disease severity. Methods: A search strategy was developed for online databases. Search terms used were "Chikungunya" AND "Diabetes, Hypertension, Stroke, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Artery Diseases, Obesity, OR Asthma". Only 11 articles documenting the frequency of comorbidities in CHIKV were included. Metaanalyses were conducted to evaluate the overall prevalence of comorbidities in the CHIKV infection and stratify the estimates by severity. Results: Among 2,773 CHIKV patients, hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (31.3%; 95%CI: 17.9-48.8%) followed by diabetes (20.5%; 95%CI: 12.7-31.3%), cardiac diseases (14.8%; 95%CI: 8.1-25.5%) and asthma (7.9%; 95%CI: 3.3-17.7). There was 4-to 5-fold significant increased prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases in CHIKV patients over 50 years of age compared to their younger counterparts. Severe CHIKV cases had a significantly higher proportion of diabetes than non-severe cases (p < 0.05). CHIKV patients with diabetes had OR of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.05-1.48; p = 0.0135) for developing severe infection outcome compared to those with no diabetes. Conclusion: Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac diseases may contribute to the severe outcome of CHIKV. Diabetic subjects may be at higher risk of severe infection. These findings may be relevant in developing public health measures and practices targeting CHIKV patients with comorbidities to avert the severe outcome of the infectious disease. Crown

L'expérience carcérale conforte les détenues-danseuses dans les processus de conscience sensorielle et identitaire, d'estime de soi, de réintégration sociale. Les répercussions touchant les corps et les âmes renvoient aussi à une réflexionen miroir -sur l'actualité anxiogène et contraignante : cohabitation dans le respect d'autrui ou insupportable (surnombre, conflit, violence conjugale…), détresse des personnes vulnérables ou isolées en EHPAD malgré des aménagements soignant… en insistant sur les ressources psychocorporelles positives, vitalisantes, propices à de bienfaisantes « évasions ». Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing covid-19 pandemic are compared through the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Page 2 of 10 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence / her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women starts with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, leaded by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women's physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined populationyouth to elderlytry to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems. A panel of situations goes from deleterious conflictual relationships, dramatic isolation, to funny and positive ones using creativeness to escape, facing the disruption of daily life. Démarrée en octobre 2019 (prévue du 18 octobre 2019 au 26 juillet 2020), l'exposition sonne étonnamment comme une vision prémonitoire. Quel rapprochement avec nos vies confinées ? Certains logements sont parfois à peine plus spacieux qu'une cellule… De fait, les détenus, les familles très nombreuses ou élargies des quartiers populaires, les travailleurs précarisés et migrants en foyer, tous connaissent une sur-occupation qu'ils déclarent invivable. De plus, dans le contexte de la contagiosité du Covid-19, ces personnes sont particulièrement exposées à la maladie, situation politico-sociale dénoncée dans les médias. Il faut aussi insister sur la promiscuité dramatique vécue par les femmes confinées avec un conjoint/compagnon violent. En particulier celles avec enfant(s) au domicile témoin et/ou victime de maltraitance mais de toute façon blessée au plan psychique ; et celles en situation de handicap (+ 30 %) en notant qu'un signalement en pharmacie est mis en place quand l'usage du téléphone est impossible en présence de monsieur, en prononçant « masque 19 », code d'alerte d'un danger vital transmis aux forces de l'ordre. À l'inverse, l'isolement devient insupportable pour des personnes vivant déjà dans la solitude, privées de toute stimulation extérieure. Enfin, des seniors (très) âgés, comme certains détenus apathiques ou inactifs, sont envahis par un négativisme avec sentiment d'inutilité, idées dépressives ou suicidaires. Mais la prison, qui isole l'individu pour le punir et protéger la société, vise aussi sa réinsertion sociale. Des ateliers intra-muros proposent une activité d'occupation, de production et/ou de qualification professionnelle, mais rien n'évoque des ateliers artistiques (si mon souvenir de l'exposition [J. Vaysse] est exact). Pourtant, ce n'est pas la première fois que la démarche de A. Preljocaj est envisagée, l'art/l'artthérapie ayant déjà franchi les murs des lieux marginalisés ou contraignants. Au début du 20 e siècle, dans les asiles « de fous », une activité occupationnelle avec des moyens rudimentaires est à l'origine de créations dotées d'une valeur artistique par certains médecins aliénistes dont Hans Prinzhorn [5], reconnues plus tard en tant qu'art brut par Jean Dubuffet, aujourd'hui peu ou pas distinct de l'art en général. L'art-thérapie contemporaine (peinture, musique, théâtre, danse…) est à visée soignante [6,8]. Si elle s'est bien développée dans les milieux de soins, elle reste peu ou insuffisamment pratiquée dans les milieux de détention alors qu'elle participe à atténuer la souffrance du mal-être, contrariant la définition même de la santé par l'OMS comme « un état de bien-être physique, psychique et social, et pas seulement Page 8 of 10 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 l'absence de maladie ». La frustration éprouvée et le stress dus au blocage des moyens de fuite ou de lutte en situation carcérale conduisent aux conséquences délétères de l'inhibition de l'action. D'où les notions bien connues de développement de troubles psychosomatiques et de surconsommation médicamenteuse de psychotropes pour dompter la réactivité naturelle et faciliter la passivité recommandée, l'obéissance imposée, dans ce microcosme sociétal fermé. La vie fantasmatique, par l'existence d'un atelier expressif ou d'art-thérapie, fonctionne comme une soupape offerte aux émotions internes et aux pensées négatives, contribuant à désamorcer l'impulsivité ou l'agressivité, à cheminer vers la résilience. C'est une voie d'évasion par la sollicitation de l'imaginaire alimentant la créativité, par la réalisation d'une « oeuvre » conçue de manière instinctive ou réfléchie. Celleci sera peut-être déchirée ou sublimée, mais elle fait communiquer les mondes intérieurs et extérieurs, elle révèle la personne dans sa subjectivité et son soi identitaire, elle l'inscrit dans l'altérité. Claire Durand-Drouhin, chorégraphe et réalisatrice de documentaires sur des catégories marginales de la société (prison, hôpital psychiatrique), a mené un atelier dans le quartier des femmes au Centre pénitentiaire de Poitiers-Vivonne (France) pendant dix jours, dont il a résulté la chorégraphie Blanche Neige en prison (2011) « révélant à l'insu [des détenues], les variations infinies entre la gravité de l'existence et la légèreté de la vie ». L'art-thérapeute Odile Girardin-Gantier [3] relate comment l'ouverture par les arts plastiques vient tamiser l'attente infinie des détenus ; elle observe un changement psychique et une adaptation plus positive à ce milieu afin de « rester vivants et de tenter d'exister ». Impossible, dans notre situation de confinement, de ne pas évoquer les dessins, les coloriages pour les enfants ou les mandalas pour les adultes. Ces passe-temps fréquents sont un dérivatif ludique qui apaise l'âme et stimule l'expressivité créative (choix des couleurs, des pleins et vides…). Les « oeuvres » s'accumulent dans les familles… Elles s'exposent, envahissant la porte du frigo, colonisant les murs de l'appartement, revitalisant notre espace ! Les problématiques de fond de l'enfermement carcéral et du confinement diffèrent, évidemment. Dans cette dernière situation, l'ennemi viral « insaisissable » attise des peurs anciennes, profondes, source d'un sentiment d'impuissance ou de fatalité. Si le dépassement vital de cette pandémie est assuré pour la grande majorité de la population (environ 85 % de formes pauci-ou asymptomatiques), il n'empêche pas une certaine angoisse de mort. Des personnes se défendent d'une anxiété diffuse avec une dose de

This study's aim was to examine the views of lay people in Guinea on the acceptability of community quarantine. From June to August 2016, 302 adults indicated the acceptability of quarantine in 36 scenarios varying as a function of four factors: the infectious disease's level of contagiousness, its level of lethality, the number of cases in the community and whether persons in quarantine are provided with support services. Five clusters were identified: (1) for 18% of the participants, quarantine is never acceptable; (2) 16% considered, in contrast, that quarantine is always acceptable; (3) for 14%, it depends on the disease's level of contagiousness and lethality; (4) 36% based their judgement not only on the levels of contagiousness and lethality, but also on whether those in quarantine are provided with support services; and (5) 16% had no opinion. Interventions to increase voluntary compliance with community quarantine in Guinea must not be 'one size fits all', but must be multifaceted and tailored in design and implementation to match the diversity of people's concerns and needs.

02cadf8addb72d55755378a1780b0eebccddb885	With the rapid development of molecular diagnostic techniques, there is a growing need for quality controls and standards with favorable properties to monitor the entire detection process. In this study, we describe a novel method to produce armored hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA for use in nucleic acid tests, which was confirmed to be stable, homogeneous, noninfectious, nuclease resistant, and safe for shipping. We demonstrated that MS2 bacteriophage could successfully package double-stranded DNA of 1.3-, 3-, 3.5-, and 6.5-kb length into viral capsids with high reassembly efficiency. This is the first application of RNA bacteriophage MS2 as a platform to encapsulate double-stranded DNA, forming virus-like particles (VLPs) which were indistinguishable from native MS2 capsids in size and morphology. Moreover, by analyzing the interaction mechanism of pac site and the MS2 coat protein (CP), we found that in addition to the recognized initiation signal TR-RNA, TR-DNA can also trigger spontaneous reassembly of CP dimers, providing a more convenient and feasible method of assembly. In conclusion, this straightforward and reliable manufacturing approach makes armored DNA an ideal control and standard for use in clinical laboratory tests and diagnostics, possessing prospects for broad application, especially providing a new platform for the production of quality controls for DNA viruses.
74badd024e394563add31baf5ec9d6fde58a43f3	Background: On December 8 th , 2015, World Health Organization published a priority list of eight pathogens expected to cause severe outbreaks in the near future. To better understand global research trends and characteristics of publications on these emerging pathogens, we carried out this bibliometric study hoping to contribute to global awareness and preparedness toward this topic. Method: Scopus database was searched for the following pathogens/infectious diseases: Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Rift valley, Crimean-Congo, Nipah, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Severe Respiratory Acute Syndrome (SARS). Retrieved articles were analyzed to obtain standard bibliometric indicators. Results: A total of 8619 journal articles were retrieved. Authors from 154 different countries contributed to publishing these articles. Two peaks of publications, an early one for SARS and a late one for Ebola, were observed. Retrieved articles received a total of 221,606 citations with a mean ± standard deviation of 25.7 ± 65.4 citations per article and an h-index of 173. International collaboration was as high as 86.9%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had the highest share (344; 5.0%) followed by the University of Hong Kong with 305 (4.5%). The top leading journal was Journal of Virology with 572 (6.6%) articles while Feldmann, Heinz R. was the most productive researcher with 197 (2.3%) articles. China ranked first on SARS, Turkey ranked first on Crimean-Congo fever, while the United States of America ranked first on the remaining six diseases. Of retrieved articles, 472 (5.5%) were on vaccinerelated research with Ebola vaccine being most studied. Conclusion: Number of publications on studied pathogens showed sudden dramatic rise in the past two decades representing severe global outbreaks. Contribution of a large number of different countries and the relatively high h-index are indicative of how international collaboration can create common health agenda among distant different countries.
6a7113066c115a0e665ff3f92c6e63ce07ef840e	 Initial BUN and D-Dimer levels were associated with mortality in patients.  The combination of BUN>4.6mmol/L and D-Dimer ≥0.845μg/L can identify patients of high risk of in-hospital mortality.  Developed a nomogram model that based on patients , initial BUN, D-Dimer levels could be a suitable and useful individualized tool to predicate mortality in COVID-19 patients. The crude mortality rate in critical pneumonia cases of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached 49%. This study aimed to test whether the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) combined D-Dimer were predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of 305 COVID-19 patients and compared them between the survivor and non-survivor groups. A total of 85 (27.9%) patients died, and 220 (72.1%) patients were discharged. Compared with discharged cases, non-survivor cases were older, and their BUN and D-Dimer levels were significantly higher (P<0.0001). LASSON and multivariable COX regression analyses identified BUN and D-Dimer as independent risk factors for poor prognosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated levels of BUN and D-Dimer had increased mortality compared with the other group (log-rank: P<0.0001). The area under the curve for BUN combined D-Dimer was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97), with a sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 91%. Based on BUN and D-Dimer levels on admission, a nomogram model was developed that showed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.94. Together, initial BUN and D-Dimer levels were associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. The combination of BUN>4.6 mmol/L and D-Dimer≥0.845 µg/L appears to identify patients of the high risk of in-hospital mortality; therefore, it may prove to be a powerful risk assessment tool for severe COVID-19 patients.

Within the past decade, EBOV has caused two large and difficult-to-control outbreaks, one of which recently ended in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bats are the likely reservoir of EBOV, but little is known of their relationship with the virus. We perform serial passages of EBOV in human and bat cells and use circular sequencing to compare the short-term evolution of the virus. Virus populations passaged in bat cells have sequence markers indicative of host RNA editing enzyme activity, including evidence for ADAR editing of the EBOV glycoprotein. Multiple regions in the EBOV genome appear to have undergone adaptive evolution when passaged in bat and human cells. Individual mutated viruses are rescued and characterized. Our results provide insight into the host species-specific evolution of EBOV and highlight the adaptive flexibility of the virus.
d5dd920f68dd662ccfce0991ae15ec91dee72069	Based on a new concept called " Turning Period", the goal of this report is to show how we can conduct the prediction for the outlook in the different stages for the battle with outbreak of COVID-19 currently in US, in particular, to identify when each of top 15 states in USA (basically on their populations) is going to enter into the stage that the outbreak of COVID-19 is under the control by the criteria such as daily change of new patients is less than 10% smoothly. Indeed, based on the data of April 10, 2020 with the numerical analysis, we are able to classify 15 states of US into the following four different categories for the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Today and the main conclusion are: First, staring around April 14, 20202, three states which are Washington State, Louisiana and Indiana are entering the stage that the outbreak of COVID-19 is under the control, which means daily change of new patients is less than 10% and the gamma is less than zero in general. Second, staring around April 15, 20202, two states which are New Jersey, and New York are entering the stage that the outbreak of COVID-19 is under the control, which means daily change of new patients is less than 10% and the gamma is less than zero in general. Third, staring around April 16, 20202, seven states which are California, Florida, Georgia (GA), Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are entering the stage that the outbreak of COVID-19 is under the control, which means daily change of new patients is less than 10% and the gamma is less than zero in general. Fourth, staring around April 17, 20202, three states which are Texas, Massachusetts, and Connecticut are entering the stage that the outbreak of COVID-19 is under the control, which means daily change of new patients is less than 10% and the gamma is less than zero in general. Finally, we want to reinforce that emergency risk management is always associated with the implementation of an emergency plan. The identification of the Turning Time Period is key to emergency planning as it provides a timeline for effective actions and solutions to combat a pandemic by reducing as much unexpected risk as soon as possible.
a3bfaaf674b65c60a1cb4542c7ec59d66da7a6a6	KEYWORDS Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV Epidemiology diagnosis Treatment The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a novel lethal zoonotic disease of humans endemic to The Middle East, caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Humans are thought to acquire MERS-CoV though contact with camels or camel products. MERS carries a 35% mortality rate. There is no specific treatment for MERS. Person-toperson spread causes hospital and household outbreaks of MERS-CoV. Millions of visitors travel to Saudi Arabia each year from across the world, thus watchful surveillance and a high degree of clinical awareness and early diagnosis with rapid implementation of infection control measures in returning travelers is important.

cafbc12ae6d277878f0748ba7cbb9129c8818a5d	Objective: Epilepsy affects one in every 200 children and young people in the UK. The Epilepsy12 National report published by RCPCH in 2014 recommended hospitals to review services for improvement with a focus on appropriate diagnosis, investigation and management. Consequently, the aim of this project was to 1. Investigate the assessment and management of epileptic patients in a large hospital trust 2. Explore patient demographics 3. Compare local trust data with national data. Methods: Outpatient clinic and inpatient discharge letters were audited retrospectively for 40 patients who had been followed up for at least a year. Areas explored included: 1. Patient demographics 2. Diagnosis of epilepsy including professional input 3. Assessment, classification and management of epilepsy. Results: Demographics: 23 (57.5%) were males and 17 (42.5%) were females. Age of diagnosis ranged from 2 months to 15 years. 15 (37.5%) had a psychiatric or cognitive comorbidity. Professionals: 13 patients (32.5%) had an input by a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in epilepsy and 4 (10%) were referred to an epilepsy specialist nurse by 1 year. 23 (57.5%) were referred to a tertiary centre. Assessment and classification: 28 (70%) had evidence of appropriate first clinical assessment. 40 (100%) of patients had an EEG. 30 (75%) had an MRI. 36 (90%) were classified by seizure type and 17 (42.5%) by epilepsy syndrome category. Management: 12 (30%) were treated with carbamazepine with 10/12 (83.3%) having no contraindications to be on carbamazepine. (12.5%) were given advice regarding physical activity or water safety. 36 (90%) still had their diagnosis at 1 year. Conclusions: There was little evidence of dissemination of advice regarding physical activity and water safety. Access to epilepsy nurses and epilepsy specialists is essential for appropriate safety advice and management. Psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities highlight the need for effective mental health services. Objective: To estimate the time to onset of treatment effect of add-on cannabidiol (CBD) in reducing convulsive seizure frequency associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) using a post-hoc pooled analysis of 2 phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trials (GWPCARE1/NCT02091375; GWPCARE2/NCT02224703). Methods: Patients received GW Pharmaceuticals' plantderived, highly purified CBD medicine (100mg/mL oral Objective: A recent study examining epilepsy onset before 2 years of age identified uncontrolled seizures as a predictor of poor developmental outcome. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy and safety of ZX008 in patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) <6 years old. Methods: Patients (2-18y) with DS entered an open-label extension (OLE) study after completing one of two phase 3 studies. In the OLE, all participants initially received 0.2mg/ kg/day ZX008 for 1 month; dosing was then titrated to optimal effect (maximum dose 0.8mg/kg/day [maximum 30mg/ day] or in patients also receiving stiripentol, 0.5mg/kg/day [maximum 20mg/day]). Aims: To investigate the views of health care professionals on the challenges faced in diagnosing and treating seizures on PICU and the role of brain function monitoring. Methods: An explanatory sequential mix methods approach (QUAN?QUAL) with equal weighting between stages. We collected qualitative data via a questionnaire sent to all UK PICU units. The questionnaires were used to identify 13 members of staff for semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to interpret the qualitative data. Results: 72 questionnaire responses were collected: 48.6% PICU nurses, 20.8% consultants, 20.8% advanced nurse practitioners and 5.6% other members of staff. 13.0% responders thought seizures were easy and 71.0% hard to diagnose on PICU. 81.1% had seen misdiagnosis of seizures. 39.7% used some form of neurophysiological monitoring on PICU, of whom 44.0% used amplitude integrated electroencephalography. Thematic analysis showed that PICU staff need to feel in control of their patients, and difficulty in diagnosing seizures left staff feeling out of control and anxious. Suggested reasons for diagnostic difficulty included: a lack of training on seizure semiology, sedative or paralysing drugs, lack of experienced staff to ask for an opinion, not knowing the child's background neurological state or seizure type, and the parents not being present. Cerebral function monitoring was considered a way of improving diagnosis, reducing ambiguity and raising the confidence of PICU staff. A small number of staff preferred not to monitor patients because it was not clear treating seizures without clinical features improved outcome. Conclusions: Health care professionals on PICU need to feel in control of their patents, and difficulties in diagnosing and treating seizures accurately causes ambiguity and concern. Most PICU staff want cerebral function monitoring to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment, but future work is needed to show improved accuracy and treatment improves outcome.

51de17fc1c40df3e1c165cb2f37c0238fa18ebf7	While the world is fighting against the newly emerged highly contagious coronavirus strain, new evolving ideas regarding symptoms and investigations are reverberating among health care professionals to combat the public health emergency. The study aims to review various presenting symptoms of COVID-19 especially the unusual one and analyzing the importance of olfactory and taste disturbances. 20 studies published recently in the last 1 year were analyzed and discussed for insights into the unusual presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 patients. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the pandemic are based on published information as listed in the references. Most research articles initially focused on fever and respiratory symptoms. Later gastrointestinal symptoms were also taken into consideration. Only 5 studies from the literature have mentioned any smell and taste disturbances after SARS-CoV-2 infection to date. So changing trends can be seen in publications and recognizing these symptoms has important to timely combat this disease. The majority of corona virus-infected patients suffer from mild to moderate severity of the disease. Much hyped up symptoms of the respiratory tract may not be shown by a greater number of patients. So the need of the hour especially in developing and densely populated nations is to recognize unusual symptoms of COVID-19 especially its influence over smell and taste sensation to prevent any delay or misdiagnosis.
5e3b24f55fdc84cfc263d4784c6ad6349d212866	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes diarrhea of pigs age-independently and death of young piglets, resulting in economic loss of porcine industry. We have screened 333 natural oriental herbal medicines to search for new antiviral candidates against PEDV. We found that two herbal extracts, KIOM 198 and KIOM 124, contain significant anti-PED viral effect. KIOM 198 and KIOM 124 were identified as Epimedium koreanum Nakai and Lonicera japonica Thunberg, respectively. The further plaque and CPE inhibition assay in vitro showed that KIOM 198 has much stronger antiviral activity than KIOM 124. Additionally, KIOM 198 exhibited a similar extent of antiviral effect against other subtypes of Corona virus such as sm98 and TGE viruses. Cytotoxicity results showed that KIOM 198 is nontoxic on the cells and suggest that it can be delivered safely for therapy. Furthermore, when we orally administered KIOM 198 to piglets and then infected them with PEDV, the piglets did not show any disease symptoms like diarrhea and biopsy results showed clean intestine, whereas control pigs without KIOM 198 treatment exhibited PED-related severe symptoms. These results imply that KIOM 198 contains strong antiviral activity and has a potential to be developed as an antiviral phytomedicine to treat PEDV-related diseases in pigs.
c7fa65764b12169d508fb5b564160e13e4ab0f56	Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is essential to control the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a rapid and accurate one-step multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay, along with a computational tool to systematically analyse the data. Our assay could detect to a limit of 15 copies of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts-based on experiments performed by spiking total human RNA with in vitro synthesized viral transcripts. The assay was evaluated by performing 184 validations for the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid gene and human RNase P as an internal control reference gene with dilutions ranging from 1-100 ng for human RNA on a cohort of 26 clinical samples. 5 of 26 patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 21 tested negative, consistent with the standards. The accuracy of the assay was found to be 100% sensitive and 100% specific based on the 26 clinical samples that need to be further verified using a large number of clinical samples. In summary, we present a rapid, easy to implement real-time PCR based assay with automated analysis using a novel COVID qPCR Analyzer tool with graphical user interface (GUI) to analyze the raw qRT-PCR data in an unbiased manner at a cost of under $3 per reaction and turnaround time of less than 2h, to enable in-house SARS-CoV-2 testing across laboratories.

4efb52a369012856b987162de929acfdd83d0062	The prolonged lockdown of health services providing high-complexity fertility treatments -as currently recommended by many reproductive medicine entities-is detrimental for society as a whole, and infertility patients in particular. Globally, approximately 0.3% of all infants born every year are conceived using assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments. By contrast, the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported so far represents approximately 1.0% of the total deaths expected to occur worldwide over the first three months of the current year. It seems, therefore, that the number of infants expected to be conceived and born -but who will not be so due to the lockdown of infertility services-might be as significant as the total number of deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. We herein propose remedies that include a prognostic-stratification of more vulnerable infertility cases in order to plan a progressive restart of worldwide fertility treatments. At a time when preventing complications and limiting burdens for national health systems represent relevant issues, our viewpoint might help competent authorities and health care providers to identify patients who should be prioritized for the continuation of fertility care in a safe environment.
af47270092a217d025dd17f45aad539f1dc6971e	Non-dioxin-like (NDL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants, associated with a range of adverse health effects, including interference with the immune system. In this study, we investigate the capability of NDL-PCBs 101, 153, and 180, 3 of the 6 NDL-PCBs defined as indicators, to impair the immune response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated J774A.1 and primary murine macrophages. Our results clearly demonstrate that the exposure of J774A.1 and primary macrophages to NDL-PCB 153 or 180 or all NDL-PCBs mixtures causes a significant reduction in LPS-induced cytokine/ chemokine synthesis, such as tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6, together with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, involved in cell recruitment. Moreover, PCBs were found to suppress LPS-stimulated NO production, and to reduce cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in J774A.1 and primary macrophages. At mechanistic level, PCBs significantly counteract the LPS-driven toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and CD14 upregulation, therefore inhibiting downstream nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB) activation in J774A.1. Furthermore, PCBs determine a significant loss of macrophage endocytic capacity, a prerequisite for efficient antigen presentation. Taken together, these data indicate that NDL-PCBs reduce macrophage responsiveness, particularly when they are combined at concentrations per se inactive, impairing the capability to orchestrate a proper immune response to an infectious stimulus, disrupting TLR4/NF-jB pathway.
7fd0f417eeac8067638e117887a83d7edd9d308a	Hyperleukocytosis is a rare form of paraneoplastic syndrome that has been reported in adenocarcinomas, particularly pancreatic cancer. We present an elderly man with chronic abdominal pain and weight loss for six months. On examination, he had diffuse tenderness and marked ascites. A workup with a CT scan revealed a pancreatic mass, which was confirmed to be pancreatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy. His lab work showed a significant leukocytosis. An extensive infectious workup was negative. He was not on any medications known to cause a leukocytosis; therefore, his leukocytosis was attributed to his cancer. Unfortunately, he died just a few days later. This case highlights hyperleukocytosis as a paraneoplastic syndrome that is a poor prognostic sign, and can be used as a marker for disease progression.
eff7cfffb7b32b0063de5f8e8692989e9ed58edc	Governmental reactions to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen as ethics communication. Governments can contain the disease and thereby mitigate the detrimental public health impact; allow the virus to spread to reach herd immunity; test, track, isolate, and treat; and suppress the disease regionally. An observation of Sweden and Finland showed a difference in feasible ways to communicate the chosen policy to the citizenry. Sweden assumed the herd immunity strategy and backed it up with health utilitarian arguments. This was easy to communicate to the Swedish people, who appreciated the voluntary restrictions approach and trusted their decision makers. Finland chose the contain and mitigate strategy and was towards the end of the observation period apparently hesitating between suppression and the test, track, isolate, and treat approach. Both are difficult to communicate to the general public accurately, truthfully, and acceptably. Apart from health utilitarian argumentation, something like the republican political philosophy or selective truth telling are needed. The application of republicanism to the issue, however, is problematic, and hiding the truth seems to go against the basic tenets of liberal democracy.
6f22bd9b49b8d4e320160285611adac4cdbe9e1a	During outbreaks of infectious diseases or in cases of severely ill patients, it is imperative to identify the causative agent. This report describes several events in which virus isolation and identification by electron microscopy were critical to initial recognition of the etiologic agent, which was further analyzed by additional laboratory diagnostic assays. Examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Nipah, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, West Nile, Cache Valley, and Heartland viruses. These cases illustrate the importance of the techniques of cell culture and electron microscopy in pathogen identification and recognition of emerging diseases.
a54b221e75646e6c3b643c583f8d7b8bdabfce26	A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused outbreaks in multiple countries and the number of cases is rapidly increasing through human-to-human transmission. Clinical phenomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical in distinguishing it from other respiratory infections. The extent and characteristics of those phenomes varied depending on the severities of the infection, for example, beginning with fever or a mild cough, progressed with signs of pneumonia, and worsened with severe or even fatal respiratory difficulty in acute respiratory distress syndrome. We summarized clinical phenomes of 3795 patients with COVID-19 based on 80 published reports from the onset of outbreak to March 2020 to emphasize the importance and specificity of those phenomes in diagnosis and treatment of infection, and evaluate the impact on medical services. The data show that the incidence of male patients was higher than that of females and the level of C-reaction protein was increased as well as most patients' imaging included ground-glass opacity. Clinical phenomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. There is an urgent need to develop an artificial intelligence-based machine learning capacity to analyze and integrate radiomics-or imaging-based, patient-based, clinicianbased, and molecular measurements-based data to fight the outbreak of COVID-19 and enable more efficient responses to unknown infections in future.
948814d3392ded72ea50bba3c3c4e952059c3729	Several Italian towns are under lockdown to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The level of transmission reduction required for physical distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a crucial question. We show that very high adherence to community quarantine (total stay-home policy) and a small household size is necessary for curbing the outbreak in a lockeddown town. The larger the household size and amount of time in the public, the longer the lockdown period needed.
185dd95e212398394200f18a0e93ca1f81c58700	Borna disease is a severe, immunopathological disorder of the central nervous system caused by the infection with the Borna disease virus (BDV). The detection of BDV in diseased animals, mainly sheep and horses, is achieved by histological, immunohistochemical and serological approaches and/or PCR-based technologies. In the present study, reverse transcription, real-time PCR assays were established for the detection of BDV in the brain tissue from sheep and horses, using loci for the p40 (nucleoprotein) and the p24 (phosphoprotein) genes. The PCRs were equally specific and sensitive, detecting 10 target molecules per reaction and one BDV-infected cell among 10 6 non-infected cells. In tissues from BDV-diseased sheep and horses, the p24 target was detected at higher abundance than for p40. Therefore, the p24 test is suggested to be of higher value in the diagnostic laboratory. However, both assays should be useful for addressing questions in pathogenesis and for detecting BDV reservoirs in endemic areas. r
7e42df4651cea8d8f25f1c49e331b478389ef238	Due to their robust immunomodulatory capabilities, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been used as a cellular therapy for a number of human diseases. Part of the mechanism of action of MSCs is the production of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids that transmit signals to recipient cells that change their biologic behavior. This review briefly summarizes the development of MSCs as a treatment for human diseases as well as describes our present understanding of exosomes; how they exert their effects on target cells, and how they are differentiated from other EVs. The current treatment paradigm for acute radiation syndrome (ARS) is discussed, and how MSCs and MSC derived exosomes are emerging as treatment options for treating patients after radiation exposure. Other conditions such as graftversus-host disease and cardiovascular disease/stroke are discussed as examples to highlight the immunomodulatory and regenerative capacity of MSC-exosomes. Finally, a consideration is given to how these cell-based therapies could possibly be deployed in the event of a catastrophic radiation exposure event.
2639081061d7e43ad562998ceee7076d0a83ce2f	Text analysis has been used by scholars to research attitudes toward vaccination and is particularly timely due to the rise of medical misinformation via social media. This study uses a sample of 9581 vaccine-related tweets in the period 1 January 2019 to 5 April 2019. The time period is of the essence because during this time, a measles outbreak was prevalent throughout the United States and a public debate was raging. Sentiment analysis is applied to the sample, clustering the data into topics using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) technique. The analyses suggest that most (about 77%) of the tweets focused on the search for new/better vaccines for diseases such as the Ebola virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), and the flu. Of the remainder, about half concerned the recent measles outbreak in the United States, and about half were part of ongoing debates between supporters and opponents of vaccination against measles in particular. While these numbers currently suggest a relatively small role for vaccine misinformation, the concept of herd immunity puts that role in context. Nevertheless, going forward, health experts should consider the potential for the increasing spread of falsehoods that may get firmly entrenched in the public mind.
628b63978a499c7cdecbccf06dd60980da895fb0	To study renalase's expression and distribution in renal tissues and cells, renalase coded DNA vaccine was constructed, and anti-renalase monoclonal antibodies were produced using DNA immunization and hybridoma technique, followed by further investigation with immunological testing and western blotting to detect the expression and distribution of renalase among the renal tissue and cells. Anti-renalase monoclonal antibodies were successfully prepared by using DNA immunization technique. Further studies with anti-renalase monoclonal antibody showed that renalase expressed in glomeruli, tubule, mesangial cells, podocytes, renal tubule epithelial cells and its cells supernatant. Renalase is wildly expressed in kidney, including glomeruli, tubule, mesangial cells, podocytes and tubule epithelial cells, and may be secreted by tubule epithelial cells primarily.
162a1c855ec5b9294a9bc3697b945779b1523385	Severe acute respiratory syndrome -associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was introduced to the United States through air travel. Although the risk of SARS-CoV transmission within aircraft cabins has been addressed by several studies, the magnitude of the risk remains unclear. Methods. We attempted to contact all persons with working US telephone numbers aboard seven US-bound fl ights carrying SARS patients. Consenting participants responded to a questionnaire, and a serum sample was collected at least 38 days after the fl ight and tested for SARS-CoV-associated antibodies. Participants reporting an illness compatible with SARS, with onset during the 2-to 10-day incubation period, were considered suspect cases; positive serology was required for confi rmed cases. Results. Among 1,766 passengers and crew, 339 (19%) persons were contacted. Of these, 312 (92%) completed questionnaires, and blood was collected from 127 (37%). Serology was negative for all 127 participants, including three of four who met the clinical case criteria for SARS, and the fourth had a mild illness that lasted only 5 days. Conclusions. Transmission of SARS-associated CoV was not observed, suggesting that the risk of transmission is not amplifi ed aboard aircraft.
456dd1fcd4e5ce47cc6be199ce8462f6213d814e	Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Inactivated SARS-CoV has been explored as a vaccine against SARS-CoV. However, safe and potent adjuvants, especially with more efficient and economical needle-free vaccination are always needed more urgently in a pandemic. The development of a safe and effective mucosal adjuvant and vaccine for prevention of emergent infectious diseases such as SARS will be an important advancement. PIKA, a stabilized derivative of Poly (I:C), was previously reported to be safe and potent as adjuvant in mouse models. In the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with this improved Poly (I:C) derivative induced strong anti-SARS-CoV mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses with neutralizing activity against pseudotyped virus. Although intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites, co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with PIKA as adjuvant could induce a much higher neutralizing activity. When intranasal immunization was used, PIKA was obligatorily for inducing neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites and was correlated with both mucosal IgA and mucosal IgG response. Overall, PIKA could be a good mucosal adjuvant candidate for inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine for use in possible future pandemic.

In this Perspective, we present a rationale for an urgent need to investigate this possible impact and therapeutic options for COVID-19 based on dietary and microbiome modifications. The mitigating role of nanotechnology with relation to the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus is highlighted.

Background: Along with the increasing number of infections, the world has paid widespread attention to Methods: This cross-sectional study used a convenience sampling method that included a demographics questionnaire and the Nurses' Perceived Professional Benefits Questionnaire. The survey was distributed to 1,787 nurses from 36 hospitals in China. Results: In total, 1176 questionnaires were usable for this research. 92.79% of nurses were willing to participate in care of patients with COVID-19. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses were less willing to participate, while surgical nurses were more willing to participate. In addition, nurses with high positive This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved professional perception scores were more willing to participate than those with low scores. Conclusion: The vast majority of nurses were willing to participate in care of patients with COVID-19 in China. Surgical nurses and nurses with positive professional perceptions are more likely to be willing to participate in treatment. Implications for nursing management: To increase nurses' willingness to participate in care of patients with COVID-19, improving the sense of perceived professional benefits, offering salary and offering paid sick leave for nursing staff are effective ways. In addition, raise the awareness of infectious diseases and increase pre-disaster training during infectious diseases is critical
b261026c3a301a412b4bf9fd62ad9b5830224eec	The global pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HCWs). We aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCWs in comparison to the stress brought on by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in Saudi Arabia. Between February 5th and 16th, 2020, 811 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary care teaching hospital were invited to fill a questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the novel coronavirus pandemic, along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Anxiety Severity screening tool.

657558034931a24e09f761877fed36cb70f4f6fe	Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); manifestations of the disease are diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. Starting from the end of 2010, a PED outbreak occurred in several pig-producing provinces in southern China. Subsequently, the disease spread throughout the country and caused enormous economic losses to the pork industry. Accumulating studies demonstrated that new PEDV variants that appeared in China were responsible for the PED outbreak. In the current mini-review, we summarize PEDV epidemiology and vaccination in China.
9db2742e2ee1e7489864834114fca91d2f9248d9	The impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known. Here we compare the outcomes of a cohort of rheumatic patients with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness. In this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+ COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or autoimmune/immunomediated diseases (AI/IMID). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1, and matched by age, sex, and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, ICU admission, or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID treatment, using logistic regression. The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 [IQR 53-78] and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and AI/IMID (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID was 31·6% in the rheumatic and 28·1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with severe COVID were increased age (OR 5·31; CI 3·14-8·95), male sex (2·13; CI 1·35-3·36) and having an AI/IMID (OR 1·98; CI 1·15-3·41). In patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases aging, sex and having an AI/IMID but not IA nor previous immunosuppressive therapies were associated with severe COVID-19.
01b3b4982949751923c6a5b9168f95a834b31b46	Background: Reconfiguration of urgent and emergency care services often increases travel time/distance for patients to reach an appropriate facility. Evidence of the effects of reconfiguration is important for local communities and commissioners and providers of health services. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the evidence regarding effects of service reconfigurations that increase the time/distance for some patients to reach an urgent and emergency care (UEC) facility. We searched seven bibliographic databases from 2000 to February 2019 and used citation tracking and reference lists to identify additional studies. We included studies of any design that compared outcomes for people with conditions requiring emergency treatment before and after service reconfiguration with an associated change in travel time/distance to access UEC. Studies had to be conducted in the UK or other developed countries. Data extraction and quality assessment (using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for quasi-experimental studies) were undertaken by a single reviewer with a sample checked for accuracy and consistency. We performed a narrative synthesis of the included studies. Overall strength of evidence was assessed using a previously published method that considers volume, quality and consistency. Results: We included 12 studies, of which six were conducted in the USA, two in the UK and four in other European countries. The studies used a variety of observational designs, with before-after and cohort designs being most common. Only two studies included an independent control site/sites where no reconfiguration had taken place. The reconfigurations evaluated in these studies reported relatively small effects on average travel times/distance. Discussion: For studies of general UEC populations, there was no convincing evidence as to whether reconfiguration affected mortality risk. However, evidence of increased risk was identified from studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, particularly 1 to 4 years after reconfiguration. Evidence for other conditions was inconsistent or very limited. Conclusions: We found insufficient evidence to determine whether increased distance to UEC increases mortality risk for the general population of people requiring UEC, although this conclusion may not extend to people with specific conditions.
1db976ba0a4234da9954d77aca96874f7dcd6e7a	Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a member of Togaviridae family, which also includes Chikungunya virus as a notorious member. MAYV recently emerged in urban areas of the Americas, and this emergence emphasized the current paucity of knowledge about its replication cycle. The macro domain (MD) of MAYV belongs to the N-terminal region of its non-structural protein 3, part of the replication complex. Here, we report the first structural and dynamical characterization of a previously unexplored Alphavirus MD investigated through high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, along with data on its ligand selectivity and binding properties. The structural analysis of MAYV MD reveals a typical "macro" (ββαββαβαβα) fold for this polypeptide, while NMR-driven interaction studies provide in-depth insights into MAYV MD-ligand adducts. NMR data in concert with thermodynamics and biochemical studies provide convincing experimental evidence for preferential binding of adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADP-r) and adenine-rich RNAs to MAYV MD, thus shedding light on the structure-function relationship of a previously unexplored viral MD. The emerging differences with any other related MD are expected to enlighten distinct functions.
8a8374824a12da118a082abac386d81a2f906ada	The live replication-competent modified vaccinia virus Tiantan (MVTT) is an attractive vaccine vector, yet little is known about its tissue tropism and pathology in vivo. Recently, we demonstrated that a recombinant MVTT expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (namely MVTT-S) is superior to the non-replicating modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-S) for inducing high level of neutralizing antibodies through mucosal vaccination. In this study, we further determined the tissue tropism and safety of MVTT-S after the vaccine was administrated through various routes including: intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), and intravaginal (i.vag.) inoculations, respectively. Using real-time PCR, nested PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays, we found that MVTT-S was able to produce a transient infection in all cases within 48 hr post-inoculation, yet the major site of viral replication in various tissues or organs was dependent on the route of viral administration. We demonstrated that i.m. injection of MVTT-S primarily targeted draining inguinal lymph nodes, whereas mucosal inoculation had broader range of tissue infections. i.n. inoculation involved infections in lungs, kidneys, spleens and cervix lymph nodes while i.vag. administration targeted uteruses, ovaries, kidneys and spleens. Critically, the infection did not cause severe pathogenic consequences in infected tissues, which was consistent to the attenuated phenotype of MVTT-S. Our findings have implications for the optimization of vaccination route and for studies on the correlation between the magnitude of immune responses and the extent of tissue involvement in vivo.

This review covers recent developments in our understanding of the IFITM's molecular determinants, potential mechanisms of action, and impact on pathogenesis.
8f66fa419ca3a45f932b729bac2a50e355c65203	The S2 domain of the coronavirus spike (S) protein is known to be responsible for mediating membrane fusion. In addition to a well-recognized cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary, a second proteolytic cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S2 domain (R797). C-terminal to this S2 cleavage site is a conserved region flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833. Here, we investigated the importance of this well conserved region for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion activation. We show that the residues between C822-C833 are well conserved across all coronaviruses. Mutagenic analysis of SARS-CoV S, combined with cell-cell fusion and pseudotyped virion infectivity assays, showed a critical role for the core-conserved residues C822, D830, L831, and C833. Based on available predictive models, we propose that the conserved domain flanked by cysteines 822 and 833 forms a loop structure that interacts with components of the SARS-CoV S trimer to control the activation of membrane fusion.
805adf0cb36778d9154e43f7070f2368cbfca9b2	In the event of a global infectious pandemic, drastic measures may be needed that limit or require adjustment of ambulatory allergy services. However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based adhoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/ immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual. This expert panel consensus document offers a prioritization rational to help guide decision making when such situations arise and an allergist/ a
8810588f364d2a1fb8208201693b5d201eb8d7a7	Expiratory fl ow limitation (EFL) during tidal breathing is associated with chronic exertional dyspnoea in COPD. Respiratory system reactance (Xrs) measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) can be used to detect EFL with 100% sensitivity and 100% specifi city against gold standard measures (Dellaca et al. ERJ 2004). The validation study used a 5 Hz monofrequency oscillation signal. It is unknown whether multifrequency signals are comparable to 5 Hz in detecting EFL. Aim To determine if FOT multifrequency signals of 6, 11, 19 Hz and 5, 11, 19 Hz are comparable to 5 Hz in the detection of EFL in COPD patients. Methods 25 subjects with greater than 10 pack years smoking history and a clinical history of COPD underwent FOT during 60 seconds of tidal breathing, using 5 Hz, 5, 11, 19 Hz, and 6, 11, 19 Hz oscillation signals in random order. The difference between mean inspiratory and expiratory respiratory system reactance (ΔXrs) was calculated. Subjects had EFL if the mean ΔXrs was ≥2.8 cm H2O.s.l −1 at 5 Hz. Results Mean FEV 1 % predicted was 76 (range: 31-125) 7 subjects had EFL on 5 Hz, and of these 6 subjects had EFL on 5, 11, 19 Hz, and 6 subjects had EFL on 6, 11, 19 Hz. Five subjects had EFL on all 3 frequencies tested. Both multifrequency signals had sensitivity 85% and specifi city of 94% compared to 5 Hz. There was no signifi cant difference in ΔXrs between the three oscillation signals (ANOVA p = 0.18). Conclusions There was a high degree of concordance between the three oscillation signals used to assess EFL in this study. This study supports the use of multifrequency oscillation signals for the detection of EFL. Support S Mahadev -Asthma Foundation NSW stipend. Mannitol has been increasingly used as a challenge test for asthma and exercise-induced asthma in children. As an osmotic agent, it provides an objective measure of airway hyperreactivity. Aim To assess the frequency of positive mannitol tests in children who were referred with a history of asthma symptoms. Method Retrospective chart review of children aged 6 to 18 years who were referred for a mannitol challenge tests in the past 2 years with a history of 'asthma symptoms'. 'Asthma symptoms' was defi ned as parent reported wheeze or shortness of breath on exercise suggestive of EIA. Results We identifi ed a total of 80 patients who performed mannitol tests. Eleven patients had positive test (13.7%). Of these, seven (63.6%) had an atopic background and four (36.3%) were already being treated with inhaled corticosteroids prior to the test. Of the 69 children with negative mannitol tests, 20 (29%) were being treated with inhaled corticosteroids and 15 (21.7%) were atopic. Mean predicted FEV 1 was (108.1, ± 16 SD), mean percentage of FEV 1 drop (14.5, ± 3.5 SD). Twenty of the patients with negative mannitol tests had exercise tests. The exercise tests demonstrated reduced physical fi tness as the cause of reduced exercise ability. Conclusion This chart review suggests that a history of asthma symptoms does not equate with a positive mannitol challenge test. There are other causes of 'asthma symptoms' that can be defi ned further with exercise testing. Further data collection and statistical analysis are in process. Objective (1) To compare the airway responsiveness assessed using a mannitol inhalation challenge (MAN) and a methacholine inhalation challenge (METH) and to evaluate their respective correlation with airway infl ammation in subjects with previously diagnosed occupational asthma (OA). (2) To compare the sputum cell counts and the quality of the sputum sample obtained after inhalation of hypertonic saline and after MAN. Methods Subjects completed a MAN and a METH 2-7 days apart, in a random order. A sputum sample was obtained after inhalation of hypertonic saline following the METH or during the MAN. MAN was considered positive if the cumulative dose of mannitol inducing a 15% fall in FEV 1 (PD15) was ≤635 mg; a METH was considered positive if the dose of methacholine inducing a 20% fall in FEV 1 (PC 20 ) was ≤16 mg/mL. Airway responsiveness was also expressed as the dose response slope of METH (DRSMETH) or MAN (DRSMAN) for all subjects. Results Twenty-two subjects with OA were enrolled. METH identifi ed airway hyperresponsiveness in 68.2% of cases, MAN in 40.9% of cases; p = 0.01. DRSMETH and DRSMAN were signifi cantly correlated (r = 0.7 p < 0.001). Sputum eosinophils were correlated with DRS MAN (rho = 0.5; p = 0.009), but not with DRSMETH (rho = 0.2, p = 0.5). The quality of the sputum samples obtained after hypertonic saline or MAN was similar. Conclusions MAN may represent an interesting alternative to METH in measuring airway responsiveness and inducing sputum during the same procedure. Introduction Spirometry is often measured in epidemiological studies of young children, where ATS guidelines may be diffi cult to achieve. Aim To assess the value of spirometry among 6-year-old NZ children. Methods Spirometry was performed to ATS guidelines using a Vitalograph Pneumotrac 6800 and repeated after 15 minutes following bronchodilator (BD). The start and end of test curves were graded according to modifi ed ATS/ERS criteria 2007. We examined the ability of various spirometric measures to predict asthma by the acceptability of the test. Results 801 children performed spirometry. Five hundred fi fty-seven (69.5%) children satisfi ed the start of test criteria, and 484 (60.4%) satisfi ed the end of test criteria in one or more tests. FEV 1 , FVC and % predicted FEV 1 were signifi cantly lower in those not meeting the acceptability criteria. However, the prediction of current asthma by bronchodilator response (≥12% increase FEV 1 ) was similar for the whole population OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.3-3.3) and those with ≥1 acceptable test OR 2.3 (CI 2.0-4.3). Conclusion While individual tests that do not meet current criteria are signifi cantly lower than those that do, at a population level acceptability makes little difference to the prediction of asthma.
db213b65f1f167d0ae37153d8c2628cdfaa32327	Objectives: This was a study to evaluate the utilization of emergency medical services (EMS) systems during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to assess the incidence of infection among emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Methods: This was a prospective, observational study conducted in the EMS system of Taipei, Taiwan. Probable/suspect cases of SARS were defined by World Health Organization criteria. SARS-related transports were categorized into 1) requests from hospitals for probable/suspect cases of SARS, 2) quarantined individuals, and 3) febrile persons. City ambulances were organized into teams A, B, and C for transports of different perceived risks. Data on the EMS volume, the transport category, the final SARS status of patients, and the EMT responsible for the transports were collected. The EMS projected volume was computed by previous years' data and compared with that collected. The SARS incidence among EMTs was assessed by investigating probable SARS (P-SARS) and by surveying the seroprevalence of SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody. Results: From March 18 to June 19, 2003, there were 7,961 EMS transports, similar to the volume projected from previous years (7,506) (95% CI = 6,688 to 8,324). Of these, 1,760 (22.1%) were SARSrelated. When SARS-related transports were excluded, there was a 12.2% decrease (95% CI = 11.4% to 12.9%) in EMS activities. Requests from hospitals, quarantined individuals, and febrile citizens accounted for 23%, 18%, and 59% of
7bf54447fa81cd0f3c36e6e6455e80241fe82b0a	Background: High rates of potentially pathogenic bacteria and respiratory viruses can be detected in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children. Investigating presence of and associations between these pathogens in healthy individuals is still a rather unexplored field of research, but may have implications for interpreting findings during disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: We selected 986 nasopharyngeal samples from 433 6-to 24-month-old healthy children that had participated in a randomized controlled trial. We determined the presence of 20 common respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus were identified by conventional culture methods. Information on risk factors was obtained by questionnaires. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses followed by partial correlation analysis to identify the overall pattern of associations. S. pneumoniae colonization was positively associated with the presence of H. influenzae (adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95%
186556aad1fdf9deb188979fc473968f5f90e3ce	The epidemic that broke out in Chinese Wuhan at the beginning of 2020 presented how important the rapid diagnosis of malnutrition (elevating during intensive care unit stay) and the immediate implementation of caloric and protein-balanced nutrition care are. According to specialists from the Chinese Medical Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (CSPEN), these activities are crucial for both the therapy success and reduction of mortality rates. The Chinese have published their recommendations including principles for the diagnosis of nutritional status along with the optimal method for nutrition supply including guidelines when to introduce education approach, oral nutritional supplement, tube feeding, and parenteral nutrition. They also calculated energy demand and gave their opinion on proper monitoring and supplementation of immuno-nutrients, fluids and macronutrients intake. The present review summarizes Chinese observations and compares these with the latest European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism guidelines. Nutritional approach should be an inseparable element of therapy in patients with COVID-19.

fd8fac08623e68548dc82e6266e9b96d9989bd29	According to the changed operative conditions due to lockdown and successive reopening a number of facts can be analysed. The main effects have been detected on: mobility, environment, social media and people flows. While in this first report only mobility, transport and environment are reported. The analysis performed identified a strong reduction of the mobility and transport activities, and in the pollutants. The mobility reduction has been assessed to be quite coherent with respect to what has been described by Google Global mobility report. On the other hand, in this paper a number of additional aspects have been put in evidence providing detailed aspects on mobility and parking that allowed us to better analyze the impact of the reopening on an eventual revamping of the infection. To this end, the collected data from the field have been compared from those of google and some considerations with respect to the Imperial college Report 20 have been derived. For the pollutant aspects, a relevant reduction on most of them has been measured and rationales are reported.

439f1b569ba0ad8c520dd1960b406e10d064695b	The development of devices that can fix the tidal volume in high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) has allowed for a significant improvement in the management of HFOV. At our institution, this had led to the earlier use of HFOV and promoted a change in the treatment strategy involving the use of higher frequencies (above 15 Hz) and lower high-frequency tidal volumes (VThf). The purpose of this observational study was to assess how survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia grades 2 and 3 (SF-BPD) is influenced by these modifications in the respiratory strategy applied to preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks at birth) who required mechanical ventilation (MV) in the first 3 days of life. We compared a baseline period (2012-2013) against a period in which this strategy had been fully implemented (2016)(2017). A total of 182 patients were exposed to MV in the first 3 days of life being a higher proportion on HFOV at day 3 in the second period 79.5% (n 35) in 2016-2017 vs 55.4% (n 31) in 2012-2013. After adjusting for perinatal risk factors, the second period is associated with an increased rate of SF-BPD (OR 2.28; CI 95% 1.072-4.878); this effect is more evident in neonates born at a gestational age of less than 29 weeks (OR 4.87; 95% CI 1.9-12.48). Conclusions : The early use of HFOV combined with the use of higher frequencies and very low VT was associated with an increase in the study population's SF-BPD. • High-frequency ventilation with volume guarantee improve ventilation stability and has been shown to reduce lung damage in animal models. What is New: • The strategy of an earlier use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation combined with the use of higher frequencies and lower tidal volume is associated to an increase in survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia in our population of preterm infants.
da98d42fbc1fd8597aca988834cd5543d934d29b	As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across the world, the availability of viral transport media (VTM) has become severely limited, contributing to delays in diagnosis and rationing of diagnostic testing. Given that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has demonstrated stability, we posited that phosphate buffered saline (PBS) may be a viable transport medium, as an alternative to VTM), for clinical qPCR testing. We assessed the intra-and inter-individual reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR in clinical endotracheal secretion samples transported in VTM or PBS, evaluating the stability of the RT-qPCR signal for three viral targets (N gene, ORF1ab, and S gene) when samples were stored in these media at room temperature for up to 18 hours. We report that using PBS as a transport medium has high intra-and inter-individual reliability, maintains viral stability, and is comparable to VTM in the detection of the three SARS-CoV-2 genes through 18 hours of storage. Our study establishes PBS as a clinically useful medium that can be readily deployed for transporting and short-term preservation of specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. Use of PBS as a transport medium has the potential to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2, aiding more widespread screening and early diagnosis of COVID-19.

d01690bafbc4c042dd47c6aa77801b56071493d2	To monitor oseltamivir-resistant infl uenza viruses A (H1N1) (ORVs) with H275Y in neuraminidase (NA) in Japan during 2 infl uenza seasons, we analyzed 3,216 clinical samples by NA sequencing and/or NA inhibition assay. The total frequency of ORVs was 2.6% (45/1,734) during the 2007-08 season and 99.7% (1,477/1,482) during the 2008-09 season, indicating a marked increase in ORVs in Japan during 1 infl uenza season. The NA gene of ORVs in the 2007-08 season fell into 2 distinct lineages by D354G substitution, whereas that of ORVs in the 2008-09 season fell into 1 lineage. NA inhibition assay and M2 sequencing showed that almost all the ORVs were sensitive to zanamivir and amantadine. The hemagglutination inhibition test showed that ORVs were antigenetically similar to the 2008-09 vaccine strain A/Brisbane/59/2007. Our data indicate that the current vaccine or zanamivir and amantadine are effective against recent ORVs, but continuous surveillance remains necessary.
1af9746ea8f584f3f58da4f59d6dba8185f8be4b	Emerging diseases may spread rapidly through dense and large urban contact networks, especially they are transmitted by the airborne route, before new vaccines can be made available. Airborne diseases may spread rapidly as people visit different indoor environments and are in frequent contact with others. We constructed a simple indoor contact model for an ideal city with 7 million people and 3 million indoor spaces, and estimated the probability and duration of contact between any two individuals during one day. To do this, we used data from actual censuses, social behavior surveys, building surveys, and ventilation measurements in Hong Kong to define eight population groups and seven indoor location groups. Our indoor contact model was integrated with an existing epidemiological Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate disease spread and with the Wells-Riley equation to calculate local infection risks, resulting in an integrated indoor transmission network model. This model was used to estimate the probability of an infected individual infecting others in the city and to study the disease transmission dynamics. We predicted the infection probability of each sub-population under different ventilation systems in each location type in the case of a hypothetical airborne disease outbreak, which is assumed to have the same natural history and infectiousness as smallpox. We compared the effectiveness of controlling ventilation in each location type with other intervention strategies. We conclude that increasing building ventilation rates using methods such as natural ventilation in classrooms, offices, and homes is a relatively effective strategy for airborne diseases in a large city. population density and a more connected world, new or non-vaccinable respiratory infectious diseases [2], especially airborne diseases [3] [4] [5] , can be widely and rapidly transmitted. Many interventions for controlling airborne disease transmission have been studied, such as masks, hand hygiene, isolation, quarantine, vaccination, school closure, etc. [6, 7] . Building ventilation is known to be effective for reducing the spread of airborne diseases such as tuberculosis, SARS, smallpox, chicken pox, and influenza in single indoor environments [8-12], but has not been studied at the community level. Ventilation intervention decreases transmission probability by directing the flow of airborne infectious agents away from susceptible persons and/or by removing infectious agents from room air. Because it relies less on individual compliance, ventilation has an advantage over other non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., hand washing or mask use). But questions remain. Is ventilation as effective at the community level as other interventions? Airborne infection, if any, occurs predominantly in indoor environments, where people in modern society spend more than 90% of their time [13] . An individual infected in one building may infect others in the building(s) that he/she subsequently visits. People move from one indoor environment to another, and are in frequent contact with others, creating an indoor contact network in which an airborne disease can spread. To study ventilation as a community-level intervention, the disease spread dynamics must be ideally modeled at the individual person and location level for an entire urban social network [14] . Many widely used social contact network models, such as a random network [15] or a small world network [16, 17] , may be too simplistic to describe the complicated dynamic between individuals and indoor environments. Environment parameters such as ventilation cannot be considered in these models, as in these models location is not refined to the individual indoor-space level. More recently, Eubank and colleagues [18, 19] developed a location-based social network model. However, the resources for building a realistic urban network in a large city are generally not available. One of the significant limitations on the simulation of an indoor-contact network at the community level is computational power. In a large city such as Hong Kong, there are around 7 million people (N P ) and an estimated 3 million indoor locations (N L , as a building can have many indoor locations). Ideally, we need to know the probability and duration of any two people meeting in any one indoor space in Hong Kong at any time. That is, we need to know "Who meets whom, where, when, and for how long. " Clearly, to model a large city there is need for a fast algorithm and huge computer storage capacity. The computer storage requirement can be formidably large; it is proportional to the cubic of the population (N 3 P ), assuming that the indoor space population is at the same order of population as in Hong Kong. It is thus unrealistic to trace every individual on an hourly scale in a large city, i.e., when and where each person enters and leaves a room. Consequently, we constructed a probability indoor contact model for an ideal city using real Hong Kong data with a linear memory requirement. Our model used the available data on population, buildings, and indoor spaces; the probability of people visiting each location type; ventilation rates; etc. Then, we developed a probability urban airborne transmission model by integrating the indoor contact network model with both the SEIR model for the spread of community diseases and the Wells-Riley equation for local infection risks. The transmission dynamics of a hypothetical airborne disease outbreak was studied and the effectiveness of different interventions such as isolation, home isolation, and increasing ventilation were evaluated and compared. In this feasibility study, we assumed that this hypothetical airborne disease has the same natural history and infectiousness as smallpox with no pre-existing immunity in the population.

1c7230a768a9650c409a13c25b42dcf5f7f3392c	The functionalisation of microbeads with oligonucleotides has become an indispensable technique for high-throughput aptamer selection in SELEX protocols. In addition to simplifying the separation of binding and non-binding aptamer candidates, microbeads have facilitated the integration of other technologies such as emulsion PCR (ePCR) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to high-throughput selection techniques. Within these systems, monoclonal aptamer microbeads can be individually generated and assayed to assess aptamer candidate fitness thereby helping eliminate stochastic effects which are common to classical SELEX techniques. Such techniques have given rise to aptamers with 1000 times greater binding affinities when compared to traditional SELEX. Another emerging technique is Fluorescence Activated Droplet Sorting (FADS) whereby selection does not rely on binding capture allowing evolution of a greater diversity of aptamer properties such as fluorescence or enzymatic activity. Within this review we explore examples and applications of oligonucleotide functionalised microbeads in aptamer selection and reflect upon new opportunities arising for aptamer science.
8bcd6f4684b338453ed77105d7c6f5b0bfd18e94	Background: Recombinant feline interferon-v (rFeIFN-v) was tested as a treatment option for cats with fibrosarcoma to assess safety and feasibility. Hypothesis: Treatment with rFeIFN-v in cats with fibrosarcoma is safe and feasible. Animals: Twenty domestic cats. In an open-labeled uncontrolled clinical trial 12 injections of 1 3 10 6 U/kg rFeIFN-v were administered over a 5week period: the 1st through 4th injections were given intratumorally, and the 5th through 12th injections were administered subcutaneously at the tumor excision site. Wide surgical excision of the tumors was carried out after the 4th injection and before the 5th injection of rFeIFN-v. A Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) analysis was conducted. Flow cytometry of fibrosarcoma cells after incubation with rFeIFN-v and recombinant feline interferon-c was performed to assess the biological effect of rFeIFN-v. Results: Changes in blood cell count, increases in serum aspartate-amino-transferase activity, serum bilirubin concentration, serum creatinine and serum electrolyte concentrations, weight loss, anorexia, increased body temperature, and reduced general condition were observed but were mostly minor (grade 1 and 2) and self limiting. Eosinophilia (P 5 .025), neutropenia (P 5 .021), and weight loss (P , .001) were statistically correlated with rFeIFN-v-treatment (analysis of parameters before treatment and after 3 injections of rFeIFN-v). Flow cytometry of 5 unrelated feline fibrosarcoma cell lines showed increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (P 5 .026) in response to in vitro incubation with rFeIFN-v, whereas expression of MHC class II molecules was not affected significantly. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: RFeIFN-v for the treatment of feline fibrosarcoma is safe, well tolerated, and can be easily performed in practice. To assess the efficacy of the treatment, it should be tested in a placebo-controlled trial.
b74bf007256ffe3f50aaa38f55176af11b3547d1	COVID-19 associated cytokine storm could induce ARDS rapidly and the patients would require the support of mechanic ventilation. However, the prognosis was not that optimistic. The outcome might be changed if the intervention of EBP was performed timely. We present a case of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who recovered from cytokine storm. symptoms or subjective discomfort until day 14. Fortunately, we noticed the elevation of cytokine levels on day 12. Therefore, the proper time for intervention based on the levels of cytokines needs further validation. Similar features were found in this case as previous literatures 9,10 , for instance, low level of lymphocyte, high level of cytokines and D-dimer. More interestingly, we found that the changes of fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) (Figure 1) were correlated with cytokines. It returned to normal range even earlier than cytokines and D-dimer. Besides, rising in the Ddimer over time was observed in non-survivors with more stable levels in survivors 10 . Taken together, employing FDPs as sensitive marker of injury and prognosis of COVID-19 is also warranted. The present patient has completely recovered from severe COVID-19. Other factors should also be considered: (1) no chronic complication and relative younger age; (2) no development of other organ failure; (3) the existence of antibody to SARS-CoV-2.
8d1416fec6111d311eb3e4d22326c37a6f56b945	Growth of fastidious adenovirus serotype 40 (Ad 40) in several cell lines was investigated. Ad 40 was able to readily propagate in human intestinal cell line, HRT 18. Coinfection assays were made in non-permissive and permissive cells between Ad 40 and Ad 5dl 312 or d11520, mutants deleted in E 1 A and E 1 B regions, respectively, to test the ability of Ad 40 to complement these mutants and vice versa. Ad40 could enhance Ad5d1312 DNA synthesis in HRT 18 and HeLa cells, although its own DNA disappeared in the presence of this mutant in HRT 18 cells. In coinfection with dl 1520, Ad 40 DNA synthesis was inhibitied by d11520 in HRT 18 cells and d11520 DNA synthesis was inhibited by Ad40 in 293 cells. This might reflect the presence of unusual products encoded by Ad 40 E 1 B region. * Present address: CNRS URA 1160, Institut Pasteur, Lille, France. 46 S.A.

8c1e9d4823f89c3b86f739fb913afb2f267c0c16	The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) has many real-world applications and practical values. The objective of DVRP is to find the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to service the given customer requests, without violating the vehicle capacity constraint. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed for solving the DVRP with the objective to minimize the total distance of the vehicles. The Brain Storm Optimization in objective space (BSO-OS) is applied to guide the choice of different strategies for the periodic reoptimization of routes. In the BSO-OS procedure, Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) and Ant Colony System (ACS) are used to generate new solutions. The experiments on the DVRP benchmark and comparative studies are conducted, from which 12 out of 21 new best solutions are obtained by the proposed algorithm, and the other nine solutions are also very competitive. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective and competitive.
a137eb51461b4a4ed3980aa5b9cb2f2c1cf0292a	Background: The complex interplay between viral replication and host immune response during infection remains poorly understood. While many viruses are known to employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity. To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation. Results: We validated our predictions in 18 different knockout (KO) mouse strains, showing that network topology provides significant predictive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection. We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation. Conclusions: The current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease. The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNFα signaling in SARS-CoV infections. Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.
24b4fb5ef7ba6d18b99bdf3434a3f6affd9d05d8	Medical collapse became a major concern under coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak; prevention of medical accidents is essential during disinfection either. The objective of this review is to enhance the awareness regarding the safety aspects towards infection prevention practices and to offer solutions for safe patient care practices including side effects of disinfectants and precaution in specific medical facilities especially in hemodialysis rooms, intensive care unit, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) chambers, or patient transport vehicle. Literature was researched that was obtained from studies of human coronavirus infections, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and created a summary of the characteristics of these disinfectants. This review is not intended to replace infection prevention policies and procedures established by hospitals, and manufacturers, but to provide some update confidence in the safety measures that each medical facility already uses and to offer additional input that should optimally reduce the risk of infection.
683f31d6b05d4f5eb77abe1e40d3e5e1fe1d7a2f	The novel coronavirus disease spread pattern continues to show that geographical barriers alone cannot contain a virus. Asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in the nature of this virus quickly escalating into a global pandemic. Asymptomatic carriers may transmit the virus unintentionally through sporadic sneezing. A novel Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach has been proposed with a realistic modeling of a human sneeze achieved by the combination of state-of-the-art experimental and numerical methods. This modeling approach may be suitable for future engineering analyses aimed at reshaping public spaces and common areas, with the main objective to accurately predict the spread of aerosol and droplets that may contain pathogens. This study shows that the biomechanics of a human sneeze, including complex muscle contractions and relaxations, can be accurately modeled by the angular head motion and the dynamic pressure response during sneezing. These have been considered as the human factors and were implemented in the CFD simulation by imposing a momentum source term to the coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian momentum equations. The momentum source was modeled by the measured dynamic pressure response in conjunction with the angular head motion. This approach eliminated the need to create an ad hoc set of inlet boundary conditions. With this proposed technique, it is easier to add multiple fixed and/or moving sources of sneezes in complex computational domains. Additionally, extensive sensitivity analyses based on different environmental conditions were performed, and their impact was described in terms of potential virus spread.

77ad8d750cd5f77ba97a4376470a5d563aee637d	A single dose of vaccine for Mycoplasma bovis pneumonia, inactivated with saponin, was inoculated subcutaneously into 3-4 week-old calves. The calves were challenged 3 weeks later with a virulent strain of M. bovis on two occasions within 24 h using the aerosol route. The calves were monitored for clinical signs and serological responses then post mortemed 3 weeks after challenge. The vaccine was shown to be highly immunogenic in calves and did not cause adverse effects. Vaccinated calves showed few clinical signs while all unvaccinated calves developed signs of pneumonia. There was a significant decrease in body weight gain in unvaccinated calves compared to vaccinates and a significant increase in lung lesions and rectal temperatures in unvaccinated calves. The vaccine also reduced the spread of M. bovis to internal organs. In conclusion the M. bovis vaccine produced a significant level of protection against a large virulent challenge. Crown
321a5877c7371f56ec49eedb54f75f504f130e8a	The proposed doses of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment of COVID-19 (1000 mg/day for 10 days, CQ; 800 mg first day then 400 mg/day for 5 days, HCQ) in many guidelines worldwide, are considerably higher than the maximum recommended daily safe doses of both agents ( 2.3 mg/kg/day, CQ; 5.0 mg/kg/day, HCQ) for development of retinal toxicity. Irreversible retinal damage can occur if the exposure to the safe doses is >5 years. It is not known whether exposure to high doses over a short period of time can also cause the damage. We recommend that before prescribing CQ or HCQ, history of ocular disease should be obtained to avoid the prescription if appropriate. If either agent is to be used, routine baseline ocular examination is not absolutely necessary. Patients who do not have ocular disease should also be informed about the potential risk of retinal toxicity. Both agents, however, have not yet been proven to be beneficial to COVID-19.
a84bc56e9cf83245e2c4d969647c576947d12567	Background: Over the past 20 years, the development of regional ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) care systems has led to remarkable progress in achieving timely coronary reperfusion with attendant improvement in clinical outcomes, including survival. Despite this progress, contemporary STEMI care does not consistently meet the national guidelinerecommended goals, which offers an opportunity for further improvement in STEMI outcomes. The lack of single, comprehensive, national STEMI registry complicates our ability to improve STEMI outcomes in particular for high-risk STEMI subsets such as cardiac arrest (CA) and/or cardiogenic shock (CS). Objectives: To address this need, the Midwest STEMI Consortium (MSC) was created as a collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems to provide a comprehensive, multicenter, and prospective STEMI registry without any exclusionary criteria. The MSC is a collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems: Iowa Heart Center in Des Moines, IA; Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation in Minneapolis, MN; Prairie Heart Institute in Springfield, IL; and The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, OH. Each has similar standardized STEMI protocol and together include 6 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)capable hospitals and over 100 non-PCI-capable hospitals. Each center had a prospective database that was transferred to a data coordinating center to create the multicenter database. The comprehensive database includes traditional risk factors, cardiovascular history, medications, time to treatment data, detailed angiographic characteristics, and short-and long-term clinical outcomes up to 5-year for myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ten-year mortality rates were assessed by using national death index. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Results: Currently, the comprehensive database (03/2003-01/2020) includes 14,911 consecutive STEMI patients with mean age of 62.3 ± 13.6 years, female gender (29%), and left anterior descending artery as the culprit vessel (34%). High risk features included: Age >75 years (19%), left ventricular ejection fraction <35% (15%), CA (10%), and CS (8%). Conclusion: This collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems with broad entry criteria including high-risk STEMI subsets such as CA and/or CS provides a unique platform to conduct clinical research studies to optimize STEMI care.

Supplement 1 presents the data collection form and details/definitions. The database in each center was stored on a secure and HIPAA compliant server with a firewall-protected network and sent to the data coordinating center, MHIF, via encrypted email to create the multicenter, master database. Continuous variables will be presented as means or medians and assessed by using analysis of t-tests. Categorical variables will be presented as frequencies or percentages and assessed by using analysis of χ2 or Fisher exact tests. Survival rates will be presented as Kaplan-Meier plots and assessed by using log-rank tests. All analyses will be performed with Stata and p value of <0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. From 03/2003 to 01/2020, the data for 14,911 consecutive STEMI patients have been collected. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics. The mean age was 62.3 ± 13.6 years. Elderly patients (age ≥75 years) represent 19% and female 29%. At baseline, 28% had prior coronary artery disease, 61% hypertension, 55% hyperlipidemia, 22% diabetes mellitus, and 60% smoking history. Left anterior descending artery was the culprit vessel in one-third of patients. Severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<35%) was seen in 15%. The proportion of patients with CA was 10% while 8% developed CS prior to primary PCI. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof N Engl J Med. 2013;369(10):889-892.
add8b6b11dbdbc0debacbdbfc7b4266beba4fe06	The pathogenesis of Parker's Rat Coronavirus (PRCV) was studied in axenie CD rats. Three to four 9 to 10 week old rats were euthanized daily for eight days after intranasal inoculation. Rats remained free of clinical disease. Virus was recovered from the nasopharynx and trachea after twenty-four hours and from the lung by day three but was not detected in respiratory tract, after seven days. Viral antigen was detected by indirect immunofluoresecnce in the mueosal epithelium of upper respiratory tract and in pulmonary alveolar septae from day two to six postinoculation. Acute rhinitis developed by day two and was associated with mild focal necrosis of respiratory mucosal epithelium. Mild nonsuppurative tracheitis and multifocal interstitial pneumonia appeared by day five and persisted through day eight. Dacryoadeaitis did not occur, sialoadenitis was detected in only three rats and virus was recovered from only one submaxillary salivary gland. This experiment indicates that PRCV can be a primary pathogen for the respiratory system of adult rats. In contrast to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus the tropism of PRCV for salivary and lacrimal glands is low. 23*
bf73e417f2711f3f1b5f355ee377e8a0a976ab89	Round pneumonia" or "spherical pneumonia" is a well-characterized clinical entity that seems to be less addressed by pediatricians in Taiwan. We herein report the case of a 7year-old boy who presented with prolonged fever, cough, and chest X-rays showing a welldemarcated round mass measuring 5.9 Â 5.6 Â 4.3 cm in the left lower lung field, findings which were typical for round pneumonia. The urinary pneumococcal antigen test was positive, and serum anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody titer measurement using a microparticle agglutination method was 1:160 (þ). After oral administration of antibiotics including azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, which was subsequently replaced by ceftibuten due to moderate diarrhea, the fever subsided 2 days later and the round patch had completely resolved on the 18th day after the diagnosis. Recent evidence suggests treating classical round pneumonia with antibiotics first and waiving unwarranted advanced imaging studies, while alternative etiologies such as abscesses, tuberculosis, nonbacterial infections, congenital malformations, or neoplasms should still be considered in patients with atypical features or poor treatment response.
e787f350feb2b86d0273a5c7c1e2dfc7adfbb70b	Background: During the erythrocytic cycle, Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites express P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1) that anchor the infected erythrocytes (IE) to the vascular lining of the host. The CIDRα1 domain of PfEMP1 is responsible for binding host endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and increasing evidence support that this interaction triggers severe malaria, accounting for the majority of malaria-related deaths. In high transmission regions, children develop immunity to severe malaria after the first few infections. This immunity is believed to be mediated by antibodies targeting and inhibiting PfEMP1, causing infected erythrocytes to circulate and be cleared in the spleen. The development of immunity to malaria coincides with acquisition of broad antibody reactivity across the CIDRα1 protein family. Altogether, this identifies CIDRα1 as an important vaccine target. However, the antigenic diversity of the CIDRα1 domain family is a challenge for vaccine development. Methods: Immune responses in mice vaccinated with Virus-Like Particles (VLP) presenting CIDRα1 antigens were investigated. Antibody reactivity was tested to a panel of recombinant CIDRα1 domains, and the antibodies ability to inhibit EPCR binding by the recombinant CIDRα1 domains was tested in Luminex-based multiplex assays. Results: VLP-presented CIDRα1.4 antigens induced a rapid and strong IgG response capable of inhibiting EPCR-binding of multiple CIDRα1 domains mainly within the group A CIDRα1.4-7 subgroups. The study observations mirror those from previous CIDRα1 vaccine studies using other vaccine constructs and platforms. This suggests that broad CIDRα1 antibody reactivity may be achieved through vaccination with a limited number of CIDRα1 variants. In addition, this study suggest that this may be achieved through vaccination with a human compatible VLP vaccine platform.
a358346359fd768ea1b35da55a8bc312b8717676	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease. Its etiological agent has been convincingly identified as a new member of family Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV). It causes serious damage to the respiratory system yet the mechanism is not clear. Infection-induced apoptosis or necrosis is suspected but no direct evidence for this yet exists. To date, Vero E6 cells are the only cell line that could be used to replicate the virus with obvious CPE (cytopathic effect) in vitro. It is known for some viruses (including members of family Coronaviridae) that CPE can be caused either by virus-induced apoptosis (active death) or cell necrosis (passive death). In this study, we examined the apoptosis in the SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Indeed, the results do show that the CPE was induced by apoptosis rather than necrosis, shown by typical DNA fragmentation, through the existence of apoptotic bodies and swollen mitochondria. This observation has some implications for the SARS-CoV pathogenicity: SARS-CoV does induce apoptosis in cell cultures and might have the same effect in vivo, responsible for the severe damage of the respiratory system.
bd26dce54abb1f5d803181956de61c49c3d9d8c5	In this paper are presented predictions on the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy of the Covid-19 pandemic based on official data and on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss Error Function as a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the Error Function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, i.e., to the change in sign of its second derivative (that is the change from acceleration to deceleration) as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations in the attempt to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease of the number of daily positive cases. Although, official data have been used, these predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach, since those predictions are based on statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as medical, social distancing, virologic, epidemiological, etc.) or models of contamination diffusion.
233bf3521bfc29bd54ef96332e8a030126099c8c	A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading throughout the world. Though molecular diagnostic tests are the gold standard for COVID-19, serological testing is emerging as a potential surveillance tool, in addition to its complementary role in COVID-19 diagnostics. Indubitably quantitative serological testing provides greater advantages than qualitative tests but today there is still little known about serological diagnostics and what the most appropriate role quantitative tests might play. Sixty-one COVID-19 patients and 64 patients from a control group were tested by iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG. All COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) and had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction result. The highest sensitivity with a very good specificity performance was reached at a cutoff value of 10.0 AU/mL for IgM and of 7.1 for IgG antibodies, hence near to the manufacturer's cutoff values of 10 AU/mL for both isotypes. The receiver operating characteristic curves showed area under the curve values of 0.918 and 0.980 for anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG, respectively. iFlash1800 CLIA analyzer has shown highly accurate results for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies profile and can be considered an excellent tool for COVID-19 diagnostics.
c27033bd085e38b51fca419a06b89de0797ab81a	Purpose To summarize the chest CT imaging and clinical features of the initial COVID-19 patients and provide a clinical diagnostic method that is more effective and can be performed earlier. Methods This retrospective study investigated the clinical, laboratory and imaging information of 25 patients in the Luoyang area. There were 15 (60%) male and 10 (40%) female patients ranging from 24 to 88 years old (52 ± 19.30). Data were analyzed by Microsoft Excel and are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation or percentage. Results Thirteen (52%) patients had been in Wuhan or were in contact with people who had been in Wuhan, and ten (40%) patients were infected by their families or colleagues. The median time from initial symptoms to diagnosis was 7 days. Ninety-two percent of patients had respiratory symptoms, and 8% of them had digestive symptoms. Fever (92%), cough (60%) and fatigue (56%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal or reduced WBC (96%), reduced lymphocyte count (60%), increased CRP (48%) and increased ESR (44%). Ground glass opacity (GGO) was the typical radiological finding on chest CT. Conclusion Characteristic chest CT imaging features could appear earlier than the viral nucleic acid assay results.

06d0656f9306f012aae2f20d0be75f8e2758653a	The devastating effects of the recent global pandemic (termed COVID-19 for "coronavirus disease 2019") caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) are paramount with new cases and deaths growing at an exponential rate. In order to provide a better understanding of SARS CoV-2, this article will review the proteins found in the SARS CoV-2 that caused this global pandemic.
82e33ea1413ab8560304175a8281348a156c2e47	Background: The homogeneous mixing assumption is widely adopted in epidemic modelling for its parsimony and represents the building block of more complex approaches, including very detailed agent-based models. The latter assume homogeneous mixing within schools, workplaces and households, mostly for the lack of detailed information on human contact behaviour within these settings. The recent data availability on high-resolution face-to-face interactions makes it now possible to assess the goodness of this simplified scheme in reproducing relevant aspects of the infection dynamics. Methods: We consider empirical contact networks gathered in different contexts, as well as synthetic data obtained through realistic models of contacts in structured populations. We perform stochastic spreading simulations on these contact networks and in populations of the same size under a homogeneous mixing hypothesis. We adjust the epidemiological parameters of the latter in order to fit the prevalence curve of the contact epidemic model. We quantify the agreement by comparing epidemic peak times, peak values, and epidemic sizes. Results: Good approximations of the peak times and peak values are obtained with the homogeneous mixing approach, with a median relative difference smaller than 20 % in all cases investigated. Accuracy in reproducing the peak time depends on the setting under study, while for the peak value it is independent of the setting. Recalibration is found to be linear in the epidemic parameters used in the contact data simulations, showing changes across empirical settings but robustness across groups and population sizes. Conclusions: An adequate rescaling of the epidemiological parameters can yield a good agreement between the epidemic curves obtained with a real contact network and a homogeneous mixing approach in a population of the same size. The use of such recalibrated homogeneous mixing approximations would enhance the accuracy and realism of agent-based simulations and limit the intrinsic biases of the homogeneous mixing. Mathematical models provide a theoretical framework that can be applied to improve our understanding of the spread of infectious diseases in a host population [1] [2] [3] [4] . A vast range of approaches has recently been developed for the analysis and interpretation of epidemic data,
5b26c1c4442a02d41b6a7f72e3e60443f4a773f9	The effects of route of administration on systemic and gut mucosal immune responses induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in suckling pigs were investigated. Twenty-four conventional 5-dayold suckling piglets were randomly divided into four groups and were inoculated orally, intranasally (I.N.), intramuscularly (I.M.) with PEDV or DMEM (mock). Pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs and fecal viral load. Blood samples were collected at 7, 14, 21 days post infection (dpi) and subjected for the analyses of serum antibody production, T cell and natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, NK cytotoxicity and serum cytokine levels. Oral inoculation led to higher levels of PEDV-specific IgA antibodies in both serum and gut mucosal sites than did other routes of inoculation. Intranasal inoculation elicited significantly higher titers of virus-specific IgG antibodies in serum. PEDV-infected pigs regardless of inoculation routes had significantly lower NK cell frequencies than those of the control pigs at 14 dpi. The orally inoculated pigs had significantly higher CD3+CD8+ T cell frequencies as compared to I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs at 14 dpi, while there was no significant difference among orally, I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs and control pigs in CD3+CD4+ T cell frequencies in peripheral blood. PEDV-infected and control pigs had low, but detectable NK cell activities at 14 and 21 dpi, however, NK cell activities were barely detectable at 7 dpi whether the pigs were infected or not. Serum IL-10 levels were induced drastically in orally infected pigs at 7 dpi and then gradually declined. Serum IL-12 levels followed a similar pattern while the fold-change was much lower. In conclusion, oral inoculation may generate more comprehensive immune responses.

The integral transforms are defined using so-called qualitative residuum based fuzzy integrals and integral kernels in the form of binary fuzzy relations. We present some of the basic properties of proposed integral transforms including a linearity property that is satisfied under specific conditions for comonotonic functions.
03f66e024d4c560bc03d460ad8042344b670ac9c	Viral diseases are leading cause of deaths worldwide as WHO report suggests that hepatitis A virus (HAV) infects more than 80 % of the population of many developing countries. Viral hepatitis B (HBV) affects an estimated 360 million people, whereas hepatitis C affects 123 million people worldwide, and last but not least, at current, India has an HIV/AIDS population of approximately 2.4 million people and more than 30 million in whole world and now it has become a reason for 1.8 million death globally; thus, millions of people still struggle for their lives. The progress in medical science has made it possible in overcoming the various fatal diseases such as small pox, chicken pox, dengue, etc., but human immunodefi ciency viruses, infl uenza, and hepatitis virus have renewed challenge surprisingly. The obstacles and challenges in therapy include existence of antibiotic resistance strains of common organisms due to overuse of antibiotics, lack of vaccines, adverse drug reaction, and last but not least the susceptibility concerns. Emergence of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics has shown some promises to take challenges. The discovery of human genome project has opened new vistas to understand the behaviors of genetic makeup in development and progression of diseases and treatment in various viral diseases. Current and previous decade have been engaged in making repositories of polymorphisms (SNPs) of various genes including drug-metabolizing enzymes, receptors, infl ammatory cells related with immunity, and antigen-presenting cells, along with the prediction of risks. The genetic makeup alone is most likely an adequate way to handle the therapeutic decision-making process for
3a6f0e8f5ab46cc609b513cf39a903691184523a	An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detecting IgG antibodies to the Pitman Moore strain of rabies virus in sera from subjects immunised with HDCS vaccine. End-point titres of antibody were determined using a pocket calculator preprogrammed to analyse absorbence values of test sera and negative controls. The assay was highly reproducible, and very close agreement was achieved when the results were compared with those of the mouse neutralization test. Rabies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is easy to perform, the results are obtained within 48 hours, and because it employs inactivated virus, the test can be used safely without special containment facilities.

12af471f81b05440047e30b963b3733bd6f33693	Medical explanations have often been thought on the model of biological ones and are frequently defined as mechanistic explanations of a biological dysfunction. In this paper, I argue that topological explanations, which have been described in ecology or in cognitive sciences, can also be found in medicine and I discuss the relationships between mechanistic and topological explanations in medicine, through the example of network medicine and medical genetics. Network medicine is a recent discipline that relies on the analysis of various disease networks (including diseasegene networks) in order to find organizing principles in disease explanation. My aim is to show how topological explanations in network medicine can help solving the conceptual issues that pure mechanistic explanations of the genetics of disease are currently facing, namely the crisis of the concept of genetic disease, the progressive geneticization of diseases and the dissolution of the distinction between monogenic and polygenic diseases. However, I will also argue that topological explanations should not be considered as independent and radically different from mechanistic explanations for at least two reasons. First, in network medicine, topological explanations depend on and use mechanistic information. Second, they leave out some missing gaps in disease explanation that require, in turn, the development of new mechanistic explanations. Finally, I will insist on the specific contribution of topological explanations in medicine: they push us to develop an explanation of disease in general, instead of focusing on single explanations of individual diseases. This last point may have major consequences for biomedical research.
6beff029f3c029e8c4198951616bdff8c5166264	Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 infection results in strain-dependent liver disease. The effects of mouse hepatitis virus type 3 on the microcirculation of the liver in both fully susceptible (Balb/cJ) and fully resistant (A/& mice were studied. In Balb/cJ mice, 6 to 12 h r following infection, abnormalities in liver blood flow were observed which consisted of granular blood flow in both terminal hepatic and terminal portal venules. In addition, sinusoidal microthrombi were present predominantly in periportal areas. By 24 to 48 hr, liver cell edema and small focal lesions were prominent. At 48 hr, thrombi and hepatocellular necrosis were widespread, and blood was shunted from damaged areas into patent sinusoids. In sharp contrast to these abnormal findings, normal streamlined blood flow was present in the resistant A/J animals at all time points following infection. Since large amounts of virus were demonstrated by immunofluorescene in and by recovery and growth from livers of both resistant and susceptible strains, the presence of the virus per se cannot explain the abnormalities observed.
da8394be4ec8cb84dae818bb2edd8227680c6313	Background-Human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronavirus (hCoV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections in children with sickle cell disease have not been well studied. Procedure-Nasopharyngeal wash specimens were prospectively collected from 60 children with sickle cell disease and acute respiratory illness, over a 1-year period. Samples were tested with multiplexed-PCR, using an automated system for nine respiratory viruses, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Clinical characteristics and distribution of respiratory viruses in patients with and without acute chest syndrome (ACS) were evaluated. Results-A respiratory virus was detected in 47 (78%) patients. Nine (15%) patients had ACS; a respiratory virus was detected in all of them. The demographic characteristics of patients with and without ACS were similar. HRV was the most common virus, detected in 29 of 47 (62%) patients. Logistic regression showed no association between ACS and detection of HRV, hCoV, hBoV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens. Co-infection with at least one additional respiratory virus was seen in 14 (30%) infected patients, and was not significantly higher in patients with ACS (P=0.10). Co-infections with more than two respiratory viruses were seen in seven patients, all in patients without ACS. Bacterial pathogens were not detected. Conclusion-HRV was the most common virus detected in children with sickle cell disease and acute respiratory illness, and was not associated with increased morbidity. Larger prospective studies with asymptomatic controls are needed to study the association of these emerging respiratory viruses with ACS in children with sickle cell disease.
e225c6b48f954eebd928c27e67102908349f67b9	Viral infections of the respiratory system represent one of the most important complications in hematological patients in terms of both the severity of the clinical picture and its related impact on the duration of hospitalization, and of mortality. The most implicated viruses are those that commonly cause community-based respiratory diseases: respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza virus and rhinovirus. However, in some cases the clinical picture may be triggered by first infection with or reactivation of pathogens normally not responsible for clinically relevant diseases in immunocompetent subjects. This issue is currently being taken into greater consideration within the scientific community. However, the strong heterogeneity in the epidemiology and clinical expression of these infections and the lack of adequate therapeutic options imply that there is currently no uniform consensus on the best management of these patients. The main purpose of this review is to highlight which viruses are currently most implicated in the onset of these infections, what is their incidence in so heterogeneous and fragile patients and the factors that lead to disease's onset and evolution. Possible or available clinical management options, diagnostic and therapeutic tools, and preventive and prophylaxis measures are also discussed. Respiratory viral infections represent one of the most feared complications in the hematological patient in terms of both clinical severity and mortality.

050f2a4720d59b24bf7994fe63401b86fa4f3a1f	Using 11 overlapping synthetic peptides covering more than 95% of the amino acid sequence of capsid protein of rubella virus, 7 CD4+ T cell clones (Rl 0, Rl 1, R18, A2, Al 0, Al 1, and Al 2) isolated from 2 rubella seropositive donors reacted strongly to rubella capsid peptides C6 (residues 119-l 521, C9 (residues 205-233), or Cl 1 (residues 255-280), respectively, in both proliferation and cytotoxicity assay. Truncated peptides C6E (residues 125-l 39), C9B (residues 205-216), and Cl 1 E (residues 260-272) were shown to be involved directly to the T cell determinants of C6, C9, and Cl 1, respectively. Genetic restriction of these T cell clones was analyzed by using human cell lines with various HLA-DR phenotypes as targets and/or antigen-presenting cells in cytotoxicity assay and/or proliferation assays. The results indicated that the recognition of peptide C6 byT cell clones (Rl 1 and R18) was associated with DRw9 molecule, while the HLA restriction element of the responses of other T cell clones (A2 and Al 1, Al 0, and Al 2) that reacted with peptide C9 or Cl 1 was DR4 molecule. However, there may be a cross-recognition by the T cell clone (Al 2) between DRl and DR4 subtypes.
3d56e7b050105e0caa25bf0767740e0d71467340	The key problems and challenges connected with the Covid-19 pandemic in the field of education in sub-Saharan Africa are described in this paper. The study is based on the information collected from teachers and parents during the lockdown. The main problems connected with the organization of distance learning, such as the availability and accessibility of electricity and stable communications, were described. The main questions connected with the support of e-learning such as unequal access to distance education platforms and tools and readiness of teachers of public and private schools were described. Key social and demographic challenges and threats to sustainable elearning, such as critical overload of teachers, child mobilization for domestic tasks, age, ethnic and gender-based harassment and violence were analyzed. It was found that the main risks are the rapid and uncontrolled commercialization of education and the decline of public schools, which leads to a decrease in the quality of education and increasing inequality. It was concluded that pandemic-induced risks in education are non-linear and heterogeneously spatially, temporally, and socially distributed. The successful strategy of these risks reduction aimed at sustainable education should be based on transition plans, which must include not only the development of sustainable education but also the fighting against inequality.
5f1378b1fa0165baf6bd31d9e4d0d66d818a37c6	Background: In recent years, much attention has been given to the spread of influenza around the world. With the continuing human outbreak of H5N1 beginning in 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, focus on influenza and other respiratory viruses has been increased. It has been accepted for decades that international travel via jet aircraft is a major vector for global spread of influenza, and epidemiological differences between tropical and temperate regions observed. Thus we wanted to study how indoor environmental conditions (enclosed locations) in the tropics and winter temperate zones contribute to the aerosol spread of influenza by travelers. To this end, a survey consisting of 632 readings of temperature (T) versus relative humidity (RH) in 389 different enclosed locations air travelers are likely to visit in 8 tropical nations were compared to 102 such readings in 2 Australian cities, including ground transport, hotels, shops, offices and other publicly accessible locations, along with 586 time course readings from aircraft. Results: An influenza transmission risk contour map was developed for T versus RH. Empirical equations were created for estimating: 1. risk relative to temperature and RH, and 2. time parameterized influenza transmission risk. Using the transmission risk contours and equations, transmission risk for each country's locations was compared with influenza reports from the countries. Higher risk enclosed locations in the tropics included new automobile transport, luxury buses, luxury hotels, and bank branches. Most temperate locations were high risk. Environmental control is recommended for public health mitigation focused on higher risk enclosed locations. Public health can make use of the methods developed to track potential vulnerability to aerosol influenza. The methods presented can also be used in influenza modeling. Accounting for differential aerosol transmission using T and RH can potentially explain anomalies of influenza epidemiology in addition to seasonality in temperate climates.
dd2cd004a197872cfce1c31a9685d6972f838efa	The detection of communicable pathogens responsible for major outbreaks relies on health care professionals' recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation. These compartments are then linked with a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to characterize how individuals transition into and out of each compartment over time.

b85cd82d242ec898a2b1c066f1ee363a76657b80	Objective: As the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 pandemic develops, assays to detect the virus and infection caused by it are needed for diagnosis and management. To describe to clinicians how each assay is performed, what each assay detects, and the benefits and limitations of each assay. Data Sources: Published literature and internet. Study Selection: As well done, relevant and recent as possible. Data Extraction: Sources were read to extract data from them. Data Synthesis: Was synthesized by all coauthors. Conclusions: Available assays test for current or previous severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection. Nucleic acid assays such as quantitative, or real-time, polymerase chain reaction and loop-mediated isothermal amplification are ideal for acute diagnosis with polymerase chain reaction testing remaining the "gold standard" to diagnose acute infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, specifically the presence of viral RNA. Assays that detect serum antibodies can theoretically diagnose both acute and remote infection but require time for the patient to develop immunity and may detect nonspecific antibodies. Antibody assays that quantitatively measure neutralizing antibodies are needed to test efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy but are more specialized.
30bf8179a7859d1b72b82985e1f44b54f92d1f3d	Mobility restrictions -travel advisories, trade and travel bans, border closures and, in extreme cases, area quarantines or cordons sanitaires -are among the most widely used measures to control infectious diseases. Restrictions of this kind were important in the response to epidemics of SARS (2003), H1N1 influenza (2009), and Ebola (2014). However, they do not always work as expected. The imposition of a cordon sanitaire to control the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, for example, is argued to have led to a higher-than-expected number of cases in the quarantined area. To determine when mobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic, we use a model of disease transmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected communities. One community comprises a low-risk, resource-rich, low-density population with access to effective medical resources. The other comprises a high-risk, resource-poor, high-density population without access to effective medical resources. We find that the overall size of an epidemic centered in the high-risk community is sensitive to the stringency of mobility restrictions between the two communities. Unrestricted mobility between the two risk communities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community but reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon sanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary infections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size. The degree to which mobility restrictions increase or decrease the overall epidemic size depends on the level of risk in each community and the characteristics of the disease.
78cc0a828b438df4987059241b39f933a1dfdfd0	there is still limited information on the diversity of viruses co-circulating in humans and animals. Here, we report data obtained from a large field collection of enteric samples taken from humans, pigs, rodents and other mammal hosts in Vietnam between 2012 and 2016. Each of 2100 stool or rectal swab samples was subjected to virally-enriched agnostic metagenomic sequencing; the short read sequence data are accessible from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). We link the sequence data to metadata on host type and demography and geographic location, distinguishing hospital patients, members of a cohort identified as a high risk of zoonotic infections (e.g. abattoir workers, rat traders) and animals. these data are suitable for further studies of virus diversity and virus discovery in humans and animals from Vietnam and to identify viruses found in multiple hosts that are potentially zoonotic. The sample metadata are available in xslx format via Edinburgh DataShare 23 . The metagenomic sequence data are freely available through the ENA via studies PRJEB6505 20 and PRJEB26687 21 (linked under study PRJEB27881 22 ). Data linkage is via ENA sample accession in Column T of the metadata file. The metadata file contains the following information: Column A (Batch) -Processing group identifier: samples with the same identifier were processed in the laboratory at approximately the same time. This may be useful information for users wanting to take batch effects into account. Column B (Run) -Illumina HiSeq run identifier: samples with the same identifier were multiplexed and sequenced together at the Sanger Institute. This may be useful information for users wanting to take batch effects into account. Column C (Sample ID) -Unique identifier for each sample and its corresponding sequence data. Column D (Subject ID) -Identifier for each individual study subject (hospital patient, cohort member or animal). Study subjects may have had multiple samples taken, hence this identifier is not unique to a sample. It consists of a study code (04VZ for the hospital study, 05VZ for the cohort study), a location code (10 for Dong Thap hospital, or 75-nn for cohort study sites), and an individual identifier. Column E (Study component) -VIZIONS study component under which the sample was collected.
8b2009353c269fd61b86c4f2aa110fad82cba402	The ability to identify factors responsible for disease in all species depends on the ability to separate those factors which are environmental from those that are intrinsic. This is particularly important for studies on the development of the adaptive immune response of neonates. Studies on laboratory rodents or primates have been ambiguous because neither the effect of environmental nor maternal factors on the newborn can be controlled in mammals that: (i) transmit potential maternal immunoregulatory factors in utero and (ii) are altricial and cannot be reared after birth without their mothers. Employing the newborn piglet model can address each of these concerns. However, it comes at the price of having first to characterize the immune system of swine and its development. This review focuses on the porcine B cell system, especially on the methods used for its characterization in fetal studies and neonatal piglets. Understanding these procedures is important in the interpretation of the data obtained. Studies on neonatal piglets have (a) provided valuable information on the development of the adaptive immune system, (b) lead to important advances in evolutionary biology, (c) aided our understanding of passive immunity and (d) provided opportunities to use swine to address specific issues in veterinary and biomedical research and immunotherapy. This review summarizes the history of the development of the piglet as a model for antibody repertoire development, thus providing a framework to guide future investigators.
b4c63d458b2753ffdbce2e8835da809de2a8c7f1	Typhoid toxin is an A 2 B 5 toxin secreted from Salmonella Typhi-infected cells during human infection and is suggested to contribute to typhoid disease progression and the establishment of chronic infection. To deliver the enzymatic 'A' subunits of the toxin to the site of action in host cells, the receptor-binding 'B' subunit PltB binds to the trisaccharide glycan receptor moieties terminated in N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) that is α2-3 or α2-6 linked to the underlying disaccharide, galactose (Gal) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Neu5Ac is present in both unmodified and modified forms, with 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac being the most common modification in humans. Here we show that host cells associated with typhoid toxin-mediated clinical signs express both unmodified and 9-O-acetylated glycan receptor moieties. We found that PltB binds to 9-O-acetylated α2-3 glycan receptor moieties with a markedly increased affinity, while the binding affinity to 9-O-acetylated α2-6 glycans is only slightly higher, as compared to the affinities of PltB to the unmodified counterparts, respectively. We also present X-ray co-crystal structures of PltB bound to related glycan moieties, which supports the different effects of 9-O-acetylated α2-3 and α2-6 glycan receptor moieties on the toxin binding. Lastly, we demonstrate that the cells exclusively expressing unmodified glycan receptor moieties are less susceptible to typhoid toxin than the cells expressing 9-O-acetylated counterparts, although typhoid toxin intoxicates both cells. These results reveal a fine-tuning mechanism of a bacterial toxin that exploits specific chemical modifications of its glycan receptor moieties for virulence and provide useful insights into the development of therapeutics against typhoid fever. The Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. enterica serovar Typhi or S. Typhi) is the cause of the life-threatening disease typhoid fever. Many millions of people including children under the age of five are affected by this infectious disease. Molecular mechanisms underlying typhoid disease progression and the establishment of chronic infection important for the transmission of this human-adapted pathogen are incompletely understood, but typhoid toxin, one of the virulence factors of S. Typhi, is suggested to contribute to these processes. Typhoid toxin consists of three functionally distinct subunits: two enzymatic 'A' subunits important for intoxicating host cells after the delivery into host cells and one homopentamer of receptor-binding 'B' subunit important for the delivery of the toxin into host cells. Typhoid toxin 'B' subunit recognizes specific three-sugar structures decorating the host cell surface, whose terminal sugar called N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) can be present in unmodified or modified forms. The modified Neu5Ac possesses additional chemical groups, with 9-O-acetylation being the most frequently found modification in humans. This study analyzes glycan expression profiles of primary tissues and cells associated with typhoid clinical signs, the interface between the toxin and glycan receptor moieties through biochemical and structural approaches, and typhoid toxin intoxication profiles of host cells that are genetically engineered to alter the expression of related glycans. This study reveals a fine-tuning mechanism of a bacterial toxin in exploiting a chemical modification of glycan receptor moieties for virulence and thus provides useful insights into the development of efficacious therapeutics against typhoid intoxication.

db9e366494ee6ea63b312e21457589fb20a82b54	Pulsars can be detected based on their emitted radio waves. Machine learning methods can be employed to support automated screening of a large number of radio signals for pulsars. This is however a challenging task since training these methods is affected by an inherent imbalance in the acquired data with signals relating to actual pulsars being in the minority. In this paper, we demonstrate that ensemble classification methods that are dedicated to imbalanced classification problems can be successfully employed for pulsar identification. Classifier ensembles combine several individual classifiers to yield more robust and improved classification, while class imbalance can be addressed through careful sampling or through cost-sensitive classification. Experimental results, based on HTRU2 data, show that the investigated ensembles outperform methods that do not consider class balance, and suggest their use for other applications in astrophysics.
23696844593c72dd8c4d74607ff26049336fe9b0	Objective: Optimal care of adults with severe acute respiratory failure requires specific resources and expertise. We sought to measure geographic access to these centers in the United States. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of geographic access to high capability severe acute respiratory failure centers in the United States. We defined high capability centers using two criteria: (1) provision of adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), based on either 2008-2013 Extracorporeal Life Support Organization reporting or provision of ECMO to 2010 Medicare beneficiaries; or (2) high annual hospital mechanical ventilation volume, based 2010 Medicare claims. Setting: Nonfederal acute care hospitals in the United States. Measurements and Main Results: We defined geographic access as the percentage of the state, region and national population with either direct or hospital-transferred access within one or two hours by air or ground transport. Of 4,822 acute care hospitals, 148 hospitals met our ECMO criteria and 447 hospitals met our mechanical ventilation criteria. Geographic access varied substantially across states and regions in the United States, depending on center criteria. Without interhospital transfer, an estimated 58.5% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 79.0% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. With interhospital transfer and under ideal circumstances, an estimated 96.4% of the national adult population had geographic access to hospitals performing ECMO and 98.6% had geographic access to hospitals performing a high annual volume of mechanical ventilation. However, this degree of geographic access required substantial interhospital transfer of patients, including up to two hours by air. Conclusions: Geographic access to high capability severe acute respiratory failure centers varies widely across states and regions in the United States. Adequate referral center access in the case of disasters and pandemics will depend highly on local and regional care coordination across political boundaries.
7ca2b80063f77dae4bfa7c9ad287b3011ff14f10	Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a parvovirus whose association with respiratory disease is currently under investigation. Objective: To determine HBoV prevalence in children with lower acute respiratory infection. Methods: We investigated HBoV in 433 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected in 2007-2009 from children 0 to 5 years old hospitalized with bronchiolitis or pneumonia in Córdoba, Argentina. Results: The general prevalence of HBoV was 21.5% and the positive cases (HBoV+) were more frequent during winter and spring. The mean age of HBoV+ patients was 6.9 months, with 87.1% of the detections corresponding to infants less than 1 year old (among which the prevalence of HBoV was 26.3% in patients < 3 months of age, 22.1% in 3 to 6 months, 25.3% in 6 to 9 months, and 18.8% in 9 to 12 months). The sequence analysis of the NP1 coding region of 15 isolates showed that all isolates from Cordoba were HBoV1 which exhibited a homology of nearly 100% both among themselves and with the originally discovered virus from 2005. Conclusion: Overall, our results indicate that HBoV is a significant pathogen that contributes to acute respiratory infection both on its own and during coinfection with other viruses. High prevalence of human bocavirus 1 in infants with lower acute respiratory tract disease in Argentina
d1f82bd6a621efe50dc1888f875c82c7d948a547	Background. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most prevalent human pathogens, and consist of 101 serotypes that are classified into groups A and B according to sequence variations. HRV infections cause a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory symptoms. Defining the role of specific strains in various HRV illnesses has been difficult because traditional serology, which requires viral culture and neutralization tests using 101 serotype-specific antisera, is insensitive and laborious. Methods and Findings. To directly type HRVs in nasal secretions of infants with frequent respiratory illnesses, we developed a sensitive molecular typing assay based on phylogenetic comparisons of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5' noncoding region with homologous sequences of the 101 known serotypes. Nasal samples from 26 infants were first tested with a multiplex PCR assay for respiratory viruses, and HRV was the most common virus found (108 of 181 samples). Typing was completed for 101 samples and 103 HRVs were identified. Surprisingly, 54 (52.4%) HRVs did not match any of the known serotypes and had 12-35% nucleotide divergence from the nearest reference HRVs. Of these novel viruses, 9 strains (17 HRVs) segregated from HRVA, HRVB and human enterovirus into a distinct genetic group (''C''). None of these new strains could be cultured in traditional cell lines. Conclusions. By molecular analysis, over 50% of HRV detected in sick infants were previously unrecognized strains, including 9 strains that may represent a new HRV group. These findings indicate that the number of HRV strains is considerably larger than the 101 serotypes identified with traditional diagnostic techniques, and provide evidence of a new HRV group.
50fa01990b8405f86066ae116511615d2ab3a01c	It is increasingly recognized that a key component of successful infection control efforts is understanding the complex, two-way interaction between disease dynamics and human behavioral and social dynamics. Human behavior such as contact precautions and social distancing clearly influence disease prevalence, but disease prevalence can in turn alter human behavior, forming a coupled, nonlinear system. Moreover, in many cases, the spatial structure of the population cannot be ignored, such that social and behavioral processes and/or transmission of infection must be represented with complex networks. Research on studying coupled disease-behavior dynamics in complex networks in particular is growing rapidly, and frequently makes use of analysis methods and concepts from statistical physics. Here, we review some of the growing literature in this area. We contrast network-based approaches to homogeneous-mixing approaches, point out how their predictions differ, and describe the rich and often surprising behavior of disease-behavior dynamics on complex networks, and compare them to processes in statistical physics. We discuss how these models can capture the dynamics that characterize many real-world scenarios, thereby suggesting ways that policy makers can better design effective prevention strategies. We also describe the growing sources of digital data that are facilitating research in this area. Finally, we suggest pitfalls which might be faced by researchers in the field, and we suggest several ways in which the field could move forward in the coming years.
372947b39005f7105cf7ecd4ce618174a655f9be	In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the modelling approach on the pandemic due to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 disease and develop a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model that provides a theoretical framework to investigate its spread within a community. Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infectedremoved (SIR) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by countries and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease.
38fbbe1b3a16485657533f4c1723316f7bdbd694	Covid-19 pandemic is an uncharted territory for the world's population. Countries are seeing measures they would have never considered under democratic governance in an attempt to contain case numbers. The role of outside air temperatures have been implicated as a potential factor involved in disease transmission. However, to this date, there has been no clear evidence to suggest either way. Along with temperatures, infection control and protection measures as well as how well people adopt these measures are likely to play a role in disease transmission and case growth rates seen across countries. The current study uses panel data estimation for the original EU-15 countries in an attempt to explain the role of outside air temperatures, health behavior and government-imposed containment measures on Covid-19 transmission rates.
c16b3804d97765832da8ea7579a114e98844c0ae	A highly conserved RNA-motif of yet unknown function, called stem-loop-2-like motif (s2m), has been identified in the 39 end of the genomes of viruses belonging to different RNA virus families which infect a broad range of mammal and bird species, including Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae and Caliciviridae. Since s2m is such an extremely conserved motif, it is an ideal target for screening for viruses harbouring it. In this study, we have detected and characterized novel viruses harbouring this motif in pigeons by using a s2m-specific amplification. 84% and 67% of the samples from feral pigeons and wood pigeons, respectively, were found to contain a virus harbouring s2m. Four novel viruses were identified and characterized. Two of the new viruses belong to the genus Avastrovirus in the Astroviridae family. We propose two novel species to be included in this genus, Feral pigeon astrovirus and Wood pigeon astrovirus. Two other novel viruses, Pigeon picornavirus A and Pigeon picornavirus B, belong to the Picornaviridae family, presumably to the genus Sapelovirus. Both of the novel picornaviruses harboured two adjacent s2m, called (s2m) 2 , suggesting a possible increased functional effect of s2m when present in two copies.
0ad93a12dda6aba8b62f2108fa4dd0b25c1337ea	This paper incorporates deflation in an analysis of the relationship between the exchange rate passthrough and inflation. Using a nonlinear model based on monthly data of Taiwan's import prices from 1981 to 2008, we find that the degree of exchange rate pass-through is increasing in deflation. The increase becomes smaller when the price of oil is excluded. Evidence for pass-through increasing in deflation has not previously been found in the existing literature and presents a new understanding of the pricing behavior of firms. Poor profits in deflation cause firms to pass through most of the cost of exchange rate changes to their products to avoid exiting the market. (C.-S. Wu). 1 In Taylor (2000), higher exchange rate pass-through results from persistent cost changes under high inflation, based on a staggered price setting model. As firms set prices several periods in advance, their prices are more responsive to cost increases if cost changes are perceived to be more persistent. According to the US data provided in the paper, regimes with higher inflation tend to have more persistent costs such that higher inflation increases the degree of exchange rate pass-through. 1059-0560/$see front matter
01b3d789dbd69fff374842fbe2d7f4150fb3d8f5	Simian retrovirus type-1 uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting to control expression of the Gag-Pol polyprotein from overlapping gag and pol open-reading frames. The frameshifting signal consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream-located 12-base pair pseudoknot. The solution structure of this pseudoknot, previously solved by NMR [Michiels,P.J., Versleijen,A.A., Verlaan,P.W., Pleij,C.W., Hilbers,C.W. and Heus,H.A. (2001) Solution structure of the pseudoknot of SRV-1 RNA, involved in ribosomal frameshifting. J. Mol. Biol., 310, 1109-1123] has a classical H-type fold and forms an extended triple helix by interactions between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 involving base-base and base-sugar contacts. A mutational analysis was performed to test the functional importance of the triple helix for À1 frameshifting in vitro. Changing bases in L2 or base pairs in S1 involved in a base triple resulted in a 2-to 5-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency. Alterations in the length of L2 had adverse effects on frameshifting. The in vitro effects were well reproduced in vivo, although the effect of enlarging L2 was more dramatic in vivo. The putative role of refolding kinetics of frameshifter pseudoknots is discussed. Overall, the data emphasize the role of the triple helix in À1 frameshifting.
4ee09ebb9ed02f045797bba2b6fc72b6330a44a7	The human race is under the COVID-19 pandemic menace since beginning of the year 2020. Even though the disease is easily transmissible, a massive fraction of the affected people are recovering. Most of the recovered patients will not experience death due to COVID-19, even if they observed for a long period. They can be treated as long term survivors (cured population) in the context of lifetime data analysis. In this article, we present some statistical methods to estimate the cure fraction of the COVID-19 patients in India. Proportional hazards mixture cure model is used to estimate the cure fraction and the effect of covariates gender and age on lifetime. The data available on website 'https://api.cvoid19india.org' is used in this study. We can see that, the cure fraction of the COVID-19 patients in India is more than 90%, which is indeed an optimistic information.
5f7c0e0bd68d969ced00ea0930aeb31cd49276f6	Abstract⎯Monoclonal antibodies have found wide applications in the treatment of cancer, as well as of autoimmune, infectious, and other diseases. Several dozen new antibodies are currently undergoing different stages of clinical trials, and some of them will soon be added to the list of immunotherapeutic drugs. Most of these antibodies have been generated using hybridoma technology or a phage display. In recent years, new methods of obtaining human monoclonal antibodies have been actively developing. These methods rely on sequencing immunoglobulin genes from B lymphocytes, as well as on the creation of antibody-secreting stable B-cell lines. The term next-generation antibody-discovery platforms has already been established in the literature to refer to these approaches. Our review focuses on describing the results obtained by these methods.
de4da12da84a030f7f57aa4ffdfdf97293bb08e7	Neurosurgical services is an essential component of tertiary level of health care, this field is still evolving in Nigeria with lack of material and manpower. There is a near complete absence of neurosurgeons in the rural communities in Nigeria with over 95% resident in urban area. Starting a neurosurgical services takes a huge sacrifice from the neurosurgeon who is faced with a decision to do something in the presence of a near absence of material and manpower, and in turn circumvent processes with extra burden so as to ensure he/she provides leadership with respect to patients care and assists in the training of allied surgeons and other healthcare staffs to mitigate against morbidity and mortality. Our research is aimed to highlight the total number of patients attended to in the neurosurgical unit, challenges, prospect, and future.
9859cb3643b735f21d647fe8d601877ee159ff98	Houttuynia cordata Thunb. is a medicinal plant widely used in folk medicine in several Asian countries. It has been reported that a water extract of H. cordata exhibits activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), although the mechanisms are not fully understood yet. Previous studies have demonstrated absolute requirement of NF-jB activation for efficient replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and inhibition of NF-jB activation has been shown to suppress HSV infection. Here we show that a hot water extract of H. cordata (HCWE) inhibits HSV-2 infection through inhibition of NF-jB activation. The IC 50 was estimated at 50 lg/ml of lyophilized HCWE powder. At 150 and 450 lg/ml, HCWE blocked infectious HSV-2 production by more than 3 and 4 logs, respectively. The inhibitory activity was concomitant with an inhibition of NF-jB activation by HSV-2 infection. Although activation of NF-jB and Erk MAPK has been implicated for HSV replication and growth, HCWE showed no effect on HSV-2-induced Erk activation. Furthermore, we show that treatment with quercetin, quercitrin or isoquercitrin, major water extractable flavonoids from H. cordata, significantly blocked HSV-2 infection. These results together demonstrated that H. cordata blocks HSV-2 infection through inhibition of NF-jB activation.
cb2ad435477b9e853e3999f84bacff20ea94dc6e	Reproductive diseases commonly occur in backyard hens, and the underlying cause is usually different from that of commercial-production hens. Because backyard hens typically live longer, are usually provided an adequate diet, and have relatively more space than commercial hens, the most common causes of their reproductive disease include neoplasia, egg-related peritonitis, persistent right oviduct, and old age. Conversely, other reproductive diseases including vent trauma and depletion of calcium are rarely diagnosed.
fdf8f6ec96b79095065c67c402279d630cba6eb3	WR has served as a speaker for Abbott The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]-causing coronavirus disease [COVID]-19 pandemic poses major challenges for patients with inflammatory bowel disease to be recruited and maintained in clinical trials. However, clinical trials offer patients who have failed multiple drugs access to study medications with alternative mode of action and the potential for relief from inflammation-mediated symptoms. Therefore, the continuation of clinical trials in IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic is important both for participants and the community of IBD patients, due to the dire need of an expanded therapeutic armamentarium. As the safety of patients in clinical trials is the leading principle, we are providing ten specific rules to guide patients and principal investigators safely through the challenging time.
6d467f4bce6f19a90a8000ea3638837b01194e48	The emergence of the novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 leads to a high number of cases of severe pneumonia. So far, little is known about the course of the disease and its symptoms, complications and treatment. We report the first two cases of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis complicating COVID-19 pneumonia.
c8b796b2f5acc0db45e572af10f9b7b53d3dba8a	The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all countries of the world producing a substantial number of fatalities accompanied by a major disruption in their social, financial and educational organization. The strict disciplinary measures implemented by China were very effective and thus were subsequently adopted by most world countries to various degrees. The infection duration and number of infected persons are of critical importance for the battle against the pandemic. We use the quantitative landscape of the disease spreading in China as a benchmark and utilize infection data from eight countries to estimate the complete evolution of the infection in each of these countries. The analysis predicts successfully both the expected number of daily infections per country and, perhaps more importantly, the duration of the epidemic in each country. Our quantitative approach is based on a Gaussian spreading hypothesis that is shown to arise as a result of imposed measures in a simple dynamical infection model. This may have consequences and shed light in the efficiency of policies once the phenomenon is over.
c3cf02d2f1c97df0c6256a8287e7fee729359b42	Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, whether N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted outcome of severe COVID-19 patients was unknown. Methods: The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as the case fatality rate. Research information and following-up data were obtained from their medical records. Results: The best cut-off value of NT-proBNP for predicting in-hospital death was 88.64 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 100% and the specificity for 66.67%. Patients with high NT-proBNP values (> 88.64 pg/mL) had a significantly increased risk of death during the days of following-up compared with those with low values (≤88.64 pg/mL). After adjustment for potential risk factors, NT-proBNP was independently correlated with in-hospital death. Conclusion: NT-proBNP might be an independent risk factor for in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19.
924abf148321c7c60332a628fd7b0291162f7ec1	Objective: Family caregivers of people with dementia perform duties that are important for maintaining their loved one's overall well-being. However, it is not yet clear how these caregivers' quality-of-life affects their ability to meet the care demands of their loved ones. The purpose of this study is to utilize a mixed methods approach in investigating how family caregiver quality-of-life affects the care provided to people with dementia. Family caregivers will be recruited from the Rochester, New York area to participate in focus groups or one-on-one interviews. In addition to the qualitative data obtained, caregivers will complete questionnaires regarding their own quality-of-life (e.g., health status, socioeconomic) as well as the care provided to their loved ones with dementia (e.g., how the care provided meets the needs of the care recipient, time spent). A convergent mixed methods approach will be used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data obtained. Results: Data from the interviews will be transcribed verbatim and then analyzed qualitatively. Quantitative data from the questionnaires will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics software. A convergent mixed methods approach will be applied to the datasets to help shed light on the relationship between family caregiver quality-of-life and the care provided to people living with dementia. Understanding of this relationship will make it possible to develop initiatives that better address caregiver needs.
c8d8ddb5653b3cd372a797839433a5c30b10ecbc	During the past four decades, most OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries have adopted or expanded paid family leave, which offers leave to workers following the birth or adoption of a child as well as care for ill family members. While the effects of paid maternity leave on child health have been the subject of a large body of research, little is known about fathers' leave-taking and the effects of paid paternity leave. This is a limitation, since most of the recent expansion in paid family leave in OECD countries has been to expand leave benefits to fathers. Mothers' and fathers' leave-taking may improve child health by decreasing postpartum depression among mothers, improving maternal mental health, increasing the time spent with a child, and increasing the likelihood of child medical checkup. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of paid family leave on the wellbeing of children, extending what we know about the effects of maternity leave and establishing new evidence on paternity leave. The paper examines the effects of paid family leave expansions on country-level neonatal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, under-five mortality rates, and the measles immunization rates in 35 OECD countries, during the time period of 1990 to 2016. Using an event study design, an approximately 1.9 to 5.2 percent decrease in the infant, neonatal, and under-five mortality rates has been found following the adoption of paid maternity leave. However, the beneficial impact is not as visible for extension of paid leave to fathers. The implications and potential reasons behind the larger protective effects of maternity leave over paternity leave on child health outcomes are discussed.
1414dd331cc6c6f0079a57308294dbc6dad51a4a	The novel coronavirus was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world, being verified by the World Health Organization as a Pandemic on March 11 th . This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13 th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.
4816ff7b6b07da5f741e3cbd3f03021c05429962	We study the effectiveness of antiviral treatment in simple susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed models that are at the base of models used for influenza pandemic. The strategy is assessed in terms of the value of the reproductive ratio R 0 . We consider a general framework and analyse six different specific cases. The same antiviral strategy is simulated in all models, but they slightly differ in the compartmental structure. These differences correspond to different underlying assumptions concerning the timing of the intervention and the selection of individuals who receive treatment. It is shown that these details can have a strong influence on the predicted effectiveness of the strategy: for instance, with R 0 = 1.8 in absence of treatment, different models predict that with treatment R 0 can become as low as 0.4 or as high as 1.3; still, in all models 70% of infected individuals are treated and the infectiousness of treated individuals is reduced by 80%. A particular assumption that can be included when modelling influenza is time-varying infectivity. We consider a specific model to verify if the predicted effectiveness of antiviral treatment is influenced by the inclusion of this assumption. We compare the results obtained with constant and variable infectivity, in relation also to the time of intervention. It is likely that existing differences in the predictions of the effect of control measures depend on such modelling details. This finding stresses the need for carefully defining the structure of models in order to obtain results useful for policymakers in pandemic planning.
84b3bbe059f24b85bc27ca49b6ba76abc3d4452b	Viral particles of human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) consist of three virion structural proteins, including spike protein, membrane protein, and envelope protein. In this report, virus-like particles were assembled in insect cells by the co-infection with recombinant baculoviruses, which separately express one of these three virion proteins. We found that the membrane and envelope proteins are sufficient for the efficient formation of virus-like particles and could be visualized by electron microscopy. Sucrose gradient purification followed by Western blot analysis and immunogold labeling showed that the spike protein could be incorporated into the virus like particle also. The construction of engineered virus-like particles bearing resemblance to the authentic one is an important step towards the development of an effective vaccine against infection of SARS CoV.
5922510e9e0a4ac16d502a74ba00971613868277	Background: Coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) is a potential cause of infarction. During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 , home isolation and activity reduction can lead to hypercoagulability. Here, we report a case of sudden acute myocardial infarction caused by large CAA during the home isolation. Case presentation: During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),a 16-year-old man with no cardiac history was admitted to CCU of Tang du hospital because of severe chest pain for 8 h. The patient reached the hospital its own, his electrocardiogram showed typical features of anterior wall infarction, echocardiography was performed and revealed local anterior wall dysfunction, but left ventricle ejection fraction was normal, initial high-sensitivity troponin level was 7.51 ng/mL (<1.0 ng/mL). The patient received loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate and a total occlusion of the LAD was observed in the emergency coronary angiography (CAG). After repeated aspiration of the thrombus, TIMI blood flow reached level 3. Coronary artery aneurysm was visualized in the last angiography. No stent was implanted. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed and the diagnosis of coronary artery aneurysm was further confirmed. The patient was discharged with a better health condition. Conclusions: Coronary artery aneurysm is a potential reason of infarction, CAG and IVUS are valuable tools in diagnosis in such cases, during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), home isolation and activity reduction can lead to hypercoagulability, and activities at home should be increased in the high-risk patients.

72565d63479f6c7a483ebfa2ac7b7ef10b021628	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a severe public health issue. The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8°C to 27.4°C. Each 1°C rise of temperature was j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / s c i t o t e n v associated with a −4.8951% (t = −2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted Rsquared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8°C to 27.4°C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8°C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8°C. The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.

8c6ca3bcb0d401ac9ccaf49bb1efd0e6e12d2f0e	M iniaturized integrated DNA analysis systems offer the potential to provide unprecedented advances in cost and speed relative to current benchtop-scale instrumentation by allowing rapid bioanalysis assaysto be performed in a portable self contained device format that can be inexpensively mass-produced. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been a natural focus of many of these miniaturization efforts, owing to its capability to efficiently replicate target regions ofinterest from small quantities template DNA. Scale-down ofPCR has proven to be particularly challenging, however, due to an unfavorable combination of relatively severe temperature extremes (resulting in the need to repeatedly heat minute aqueous sample volumes to temperatures in the vicinity of95'C with minimal evaporation) and high surface area to volume conditions imposed by nanoliter reactor geometries (often leading to inhibition ofthe reaction by nonspecific adsorption ofreagents at the reactor walls). Despite these daunting challenges, considerable progress has been made in the development of microfluidic devices capable ofperforming increasingly sophisticated PCR-based bioassays.This chapter reviews the progress that has been made to date and assessesthe outlook for future advances.
3649cfc0cd45105c73958216edcb66eaa7549001	Purpose of review Sleep is intimately involved in overall health and wellbeing. We provide a comprehensive report on the interplay between systemic diseases and sleep to optimize the outcomes of systemic disorders. Recent findings Spanning the categories of endocrinologic disorders, metabolic/toxic disturbances, renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, malignancy, and critical illness, the review highlights the prevalent coexisting pathology of sleep across the spectrum of systemic disorders. Although it is rare that treating a sleep symptom can cure disease, attention to sleep may improve quality of life and may mitigate or improve the underlying disorder. Recent controversies in assessing the cardiovascular relationship with sleep have called into question some of the benefits of treating comorbid sleep disorders, thereby highlighting the need for an ongoing rigorous investigation into how sleep interplays with systemic diseases. Summary Systemic diseases often have sleep manifestations and this report will help the clinician identify key risk factors linking sleep disorders to systemic diseases so as to optimize the overall care of the patient.
fc68ce56889e5fc58e3badede4efcb12cc00f439	 We compare the temporal trend of the COVID-19 pandemic and 1918-19 influenza pandemic in United Kingdom.  We found that the on-going COVID-19 wave of infection matched the major wave of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic surprisingly well for the past two months.  We discussed the similar characteristics between these two pandemics.  We also showed the years of life lost (YLL) due to 1918-19 pandemic. A comparison on YLL would be more appropriate. Abstract: We compare the COVID-19 pandemic and 1918-19 influenza pandemic in United Kingdom. We found that the on-going COVID-19 wave of infection matched the major wave of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic surprisingly well, both reached similar magnitude (in term of estimated weekly new infections) and spent the same duration above 5 cases per 1000 inhabitants, for the past two months. We discussed the similar characteristics between these two pandemics. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
0ceca0a9731522ddd6413ff56a0bb5c8b78fe1fd	 SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) and SARS-2003 both have a similar mechanism of infection, i.e, binding the spike protein on the viral surface to the ACE2 receptors on the host cell surface.  Thus all the tissues and organs expressing the ACE2 receptor are susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the alveolar epithelial cells have a high propensity of ACE2 receptors, they are the most adversely affected during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The devastating cytokine explosion attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to severe shock, oedema and multiple organ failure. Administering the COVID-19 patients with an infusion of multipotent MSCs can help to combat the COVID-19 as these cells will inhibit the exaggerated immune response and encourage endogenous repair of the lung epithelial cells by improving the microenvironment.  The mesenchymal stem cell therapy does not have any adverse side effects on the patient. In this review we have highlighted all the implications associated with MSC therapy application in case of COVID-19 and strongly place our argument in support of this. The COVID-19 disease is caused by a positive stranded RNA virus called SARS-CoV-2. The virus mainly targets the pulmonary epithelial cells as it's initial site of infection by letting its surface spike protein interact and bind to the host ACE2 receptor. The internalization and gradual replication of the virus results in an exaggerated immune response triggering release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This immune storm is responsible for multiple health hazards in the host ultimately leading to multiple organ failure. Mesenchymal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f stem cell therapy offers a promising approach towards mitigating the delirious effects of the infection in the COVID-19 patients. This therapy has shown to reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as repair of damaged tissues in COVID-19 patients. This review has been organized to put forward the positive aruments and implications in support of mesenchymal stem cell therapy as a necessary approach for treating COVID-19 patients.

5fea0fb4e51dbd593cf5696dabdc07b1de3e07b4	More than 177 000 potentially preventable healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) occur per annum in Australia with sizable attributable mortality. Organizational systems to protect against HAI in hospitals in Australia are relatively poorly developed. Awareness and practice of infection control by medical and other healthcare staff are often poor. These lapses in practice create significant risk for patients and staff from HAI. Excessive patient exposure to antimicrobials is another key factor in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infection. Physicians must ensure that their interactions with patients are safe from the infection prevention standpoint. The critical preventative practice is hand hygiene in accord with the World Health Organization 5 moments model. Improving the use of antimicrobials, asepsis and immunization also has great importance. Hospitals should measure and feed back HAI rates to clinical teams. Physicians as leaders, role models and educators play an important part in promoting adherence to safe practices by other staff and students. They are also potentially effective system engineers who can embed safer practices in all elements of patient care and promote essential structural and organizational change. Patients and the public in general are becoming increasingly aware of the risk of infection when entering a hospital and expect their carers to adhere to safe practice. Poor infection control practice will be regarded in a negative light by patients and their families, regardless of any other manifest skills of the practitioner.

Eight groups of 30 male and 30 female rats were exposed 1 hr per day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks, to smoke from reference (tobacco burned) or test (tobacco only heated) cigarettes, at nicotine concentrations of 5, 15, or 30 &liter of air. Similar smoke concentrations of wet total particulate matter and carbon monoxide were produced in each of the teat/reference comparisons. There was a pronounced depression of minute ventilation of animals in the reference groups, but not in the test animals. Blood carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were similar in animals exposed to smoke from test and reference cigarettes. Plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in the test groups were higher than in the reference groups. There were no differences between the smoke-exposed groups in terms of body weight or feed consumption. At necropsy, an increase in heart weight was noted in both high exposure groups. There were notable differences in histopathology, with fewer and less-pronounced changes in the test groups than in the reference groups. Many of the histopathological responses induced in the reference groups were absent in the test groups. Overall, the study demonstrated a substantial reduction in the biological activity of smoke from the test cigarette when compared with the reference. o 1989 society of Toxicology.
7d168cf1cd85ddca9eff875a79728bdbb68f6b48	We test the hypothesis of COVID-19 contagion being influenced by meteorological parameters such as temperature or humidity. We analysed data at high spatial resolution (regions in Italy and counties in the USA) and found that while at low resolution this might seem the case, at higher resolution no correlation is found. Our results are consistent with a poor outdoors transmission of the disease. However, a possible indirect correlation between good weather and a decrease in disease spread may occur, as people spend longer time outdoors. University [14] and from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [15]. 67 Both datasets are consistent and updated daily. Italian data at regional level were 68 downloaded from the github repository of the Sito del Dipartimento della Protezione 69 Civile [16]. Data for the USA at county level were also obtained from the Johns Hopkins 70 University repository. An additional attempt was made to use data from Spain, a 71 country that has been heavily impacted by the pandemic. There are regional data for 72 Spain, but this is too coarse a resolution, a single region such as Andalucía is larger 73 than several European countries. Provincial data are very fragmented, without a single 74 central repository. A crowdsourced effort to compile these data [17] has been made, but 75 unfortunately the result has too many gaps. 76 Geographical and other data 77 Global and European shapefiles are from Natural Earth [18]. Initially we used the 78 taxpayer funded Eurostat GISCO: Geographical Information and maps -NUTS, but 79 data usage is too restrictive while Natural Earth is completely open. Shapefiles for the 80 USA were downloaded from the TIGER/Line Shapefiles from the United States Census 81 Bureau [19]. Data for the population of Italian regions were obtained from the Italian 82 Istat -Istituto nazionale di statistica [20]. For US county population, data were 83 obtained from the United States Census Bureau [21]. Additional, non conclusive tests 84 were done with airport transportation data, that were obtained from the EU Open Data 85 Portal [22] and the Federal Aviation Administration [23]. 86 Statistical analysis 87 A first step is using descriptive statistics and spatial visualisation that can help 88 identifying any possible correlation between weather and disease transmission. A second 89 step is designed following Barreca and Shimshack [24]. They found that half of the 90 average seasonal differences in US influenza mortality can be explained by seasonal 91 differences in humidity alone, and there seems to be an important threshold at 6g/kg. Because mortality is dependant not only on contagion, but also on the health system 93 capacity and resources, we used the number of cases accumulated over a period of time. 94 Following Barreca and Shimshack we asume that incidence can be simulated with a 95 simple statistical model as: where f i (x i ) is a function of variable x i and a general error term. This model was implemented in the R statistical package using generalised linear 98 models (glm) [25] and generalised additive models (gam) from the mgcv library [26] .We 99 are interested in response to meteorological variables, but we also tested population 100 density and passenger emplainment at nearest airport with very poor results. Results and discussion The visualisation of Italian data in Figures 2 to 4 seems to confirm the hypothesis that 103 transmission is hindered by specific humidity above 6g/kg and mean air temperature : medRxiv preprint 135 temperature. Blaine, New York, Rockland and Westchester counties are outside the 136 chart. The statistical modelling with glm results in a very low R squared value of 0.02 137 and only temperature seems to be significant, but this is probably a spurious 138 correlation, as the number of cases increase from winter towards the spring, which 139 correspond to a seasonal increase in temperature.
015f96637c2f224a7061e826128d72197cdbe757	The outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 quickly escalated into a global health emergency. Since its outbreak until the 29th of April 2020, the pandemic has affected more than 3 million of people and caused 207,973 deaths globally. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus genus of the Coronavirus family, and it shares the same subfamily with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), all of which lead to severe pneumonia. For cancer patients, especially those with lung cancers, their immune systems are compromised due to the disease itself as well as the treatment for cancer. The weakened immunity of these patients puts them at a higher risk of not only developing diseases but severe diseases. In this study, through a literature review and data collection, we focus on the selection and consideration of antitumor treatment strategies for advanced lung cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.
db5f07cca2e8c9d47193fa957565147e7fad8d10	In California, molecular testing was useful in decreasing suspicion for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), by detecting common respiratory pathogens (influenza A/B, human metapneumovirus, picornavirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp., parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus) in 23 (45%) of 51 patients with suspected SARS and 9 (47%) of 19 patients with probable SARS.
6d03f3e2dd6554f15526cb089337fa592fb1834c	Annotation of the genome sequence of the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) is indispensable to understand its evolution and pathogenesis. We have performed a full annotation of the SARS-CoV genome sequences by using annotation programs publicly available or developed by ourselves. Totally, 21 open reading frames (ORFs) of genes or putative uncharacterized proteins (PUPs) were predicted. Seven PUPs had not been reported previously, and two of them were predicted to contain transmembrane regions. Eight ORFs partially overlapped with or embedded into those of known genes, revealing that the SARS-CoV genome is a small and compact one with overlapped coding regions. The most striking discovery is that an ORF locates on the minus strand. We have also annotated non-coding regions and identified the transcription regulating sequences (TRS) in the intergenic regions. The analysis of TRS supports the minus strand extending transcription mechanism of coronavirus. The SNP analysis of different isolates reveals that mutations of the sequences do not affect the prediction results of ORFs.
f407bf32c2171b16cb786897f2a35d4ee8a2464a	The COVID-19 respiratory disease is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which uses the enzyme ACE2 to entry human cells. This disease is characterized by important damages at multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of ACE2 in practically all human tissues. However, not every organ in which ACE2 is abundant is affected by SARS CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus. We consider here diffusive processes through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 as such alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate. By following the main subdiffusive routes across the PPI network we identify proteins mainly expressed in the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, testis, lymph node, kidney, among others of the organs reported to be affected by COVID-19.
08f3c8a6acc1a7d44fe1217f6e0c9c1959f8cca4	In this paper we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis of the global networks of integrators FedEx, UPS, and DHL using network science. While noticing that all three networks rely on a "hub-and-spoke" structure, the network configuration of DHL leans towards a multi-"hub-and-spoke" structure that reflects the different business strategy of the integrator. We also analyzed the robustness of the networks, identified the most critical airports per integrator, and assessed that the network of DHL is the most robust according to our definition of robustness. Finally, given the unprecedented historical time that the airline industry is facing at the moment of writing, we provided some insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the global capacity of integrators and other cargo airlines. Our results suggest that full-cargo airlines and, much more dramatically, combination airlines were impacted by the pandemic. On the other hand, apart from fluctuations in offered capacity due to travel bans that were quickly recovered thanks to the resilience of their networks, integrators seem to have escaped the early months of the pandemic unscathed.
fcacb7622cf8acf40ebe54d1cb282ccaf60a6d73	The Covid-19 virus pandemic is leading to a large number of deaths. There are forecasts that there will be an exponential increase in the number of such deaths across the globe because of this deadly virus. To arrest the spread of the virus in this situation, the supply of medical materials including PPE and body bags (also known as human remains pouch or cadaver bag) should be designed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Conventional body bags have shortcomings, which need to be addressed by a refined redesigning and use of appropriate materials to adequately match the requirements in the current Covid-19 situation. Current designs of the body bags do not allow the family member's sentiments towards the deceased and to cater to the desire of the family members to view the face of the deceased without exposing them to a strong possibility of infection from the cadaver. This is, therefore, a very traumatic experience to the family and in many cases, the cadaver is not handled with respect due to the unavailability of safe design body bags, which also exposes health workers to avoidable risk from the infections. Technopark@iitk has proposed an integrated 5-layer body bag to tackle this situation for Covid-19 deceased such that it is (1) leak-proof, (2) impermeable/water-proof, (3) strong enough for the purpose, (4) ergonomically designed, and (5) has provision to view the face of the dead body for family viewing before cremation/burial. This new design would keep the handling of the deceased body to a minimum during transportation from the hospital/site of death to a mortuary, and then to the home of the deceased/burial ground/crematorium, where it may be disposed-off along with the body in it, in a respectable manner, without putting people involved to the risk of infection.
0b064096b51c4cada7b64af37eae826b7e7c9649	The influence of CD25 + CD4 + regulatory T cells (Treg) on acute and chronic viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) was examined using a glial tropic murine coronavirus. Treg in the CNS were highest during initial T cell mediated virus control, decreased and then remained relatively stable during persistence. Anti-CD25 treatment did not affect CNS recruitment of inflammatory cells. Viral control was initially delayed; however, neither the kinetics of viral control nor viral persistence were affected. By contrast, the absence of Treg during the acute phase resulted in increased demyelination during viral persistence. These data suggest that CNS inflammation, progression of viral control and viral persistence are relatively independent of CD25 + CD4 + Treg. However, their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage.
8677876337f082d6d322652ab647d5fbd6cd0739	Background: Data on the risk of transmission of infection to health care workers (HCWs) serving ill pilgrims during the Hajj is scarce. Methods: Two cohorts of HCWs, the first serving Hajj pilgrims in Mecca and the second serving patients in Al-Ahsa, were investigated for respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and pathogen carriage using multiplex polymerase chain reaction before and after the 2015 Hajj. Results: A total of 211 HCWs were enrolled of whom 92 were exposed to pilgrims (Mecca cohort), whereas 119 were not exposed (Al-Ahsa cohort). Symptoms were observed only in HCWs from the Mecca cohort, with 29.3% experiencing respiratory symptoms during the Hajj period or in the subsequent days and 3.3% having gastrointestinal symptoms. Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory virus were 14.7% in the Mecca cohort and 3.4% in the Al-Ahsa cohort (P = .003). Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory bacterium were 11.8% and 18.6% in the Mecca and Al-Ahsa cohorts, respectively (P = .09). Gastrointestinal pathogens were rarely isolated in both cohorts of HCWs and acquisition of pathogens after the Hajj was documented in only a few individuals. Conclusions: HCWs providing care for pilgrims both acquire pathogens and present symptoms (especially respiratory symptoms) more frequently than those not working during Hajj.
6e6fb58bc0253b1c8326599159f321be8a37736f	Background: Globally, the threat of infectious diseases, particularly emerging infectious diseases, originating at the human-animal-environment interface, has caught health systems off guard. With forecasts that future pathogen emergence will be centred in hotspots in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the need to prepare policy frameworks that can combat this threat is urgent. Discussion: Emergence of diseases such as avian influenza and Ebola virus disease, which threatened social disruption, have established the need for intersectoral coordination/collaboration. These events led to the initiation of establishing institutionalised collaborative frameworks in India to adopt a One Health approach to disease prevention and control. However, the gains made in influenza control could not be adapted to other infectious diseases. Intersectoral coordination was briefly carried out, more as a reactive response to threats. The systemic failure to sustain such efforts have therefore, only undermined a coordinated response. The recent draft National Health Policy, 2015, has also failed to establish the need for intersectoral coordination in disease control approaches. Neglecting the need to endorse linkages between human health, animal health and husbandry, agriculture, and environmental sectors, has led to duplicative and weak response systems. The absence of health impact assessment with respect to the development agenda in policies, has cast negative effects on the health and wellbeing of man, animal, and the environment. Lack of attention to building core capacity in these critical sectors has further raised challenges in designing and deploying mitigation strategies. With developing countries like India being home to a major portion of the world's poorest livestock farmers, the absence of a policy discourse that endorses the One Health approach in development and health policies is a major hurdle in eliminating poverty and poverty-related diseases. Conclusions: The adoption of One Health approaches in health and related sectoral policies is a critical policy requirement for India and other developing countries. The goal should be to not just establish preparedness plans, but also to encourage a policy environment where assessment and mitigation of downstream impacts of different agenda are incorporated.
7efff30daffe435863de2b8b80aba44969d508f0	Bats of the genus Pteropus (Pteropodidae) are recognised as the natural host of multiple emerging pathogenic viruses of animal and human health significance, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses and ebolaviruses. Some studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may be associated with Hendra virus infection in flying-foxes in Australia; however, it is essential to understand the normal range and seasonal variability of physiological biomarkers before seeking physiological associations with infection status. We aimed to measure a suite of physiological biomarkers in P. alecto over time to identify any seasonal fluctuations and to examine possible associations with life-cycle and environmental stressors. We sampled 839 adult P. alecto in the Australian state of Queensland over a 12-month period. The adjusted population means of every assessed hematologic and biochemical parameter were within the reported reference range on every sampling occasion. However, within this range, we identified significant temporal variation in these parameters, in urinary parameters and body condition, which primarily reflected the normal annual life cycle. We found no evident effect of remarkable physiological demands or nutritional stress, and no indication of clinical disease driving any parameter values outside the normal species reference range. Our findings identify underlying temporal physiological changes at the population level that inform epidemiological studies and assessment of putative physiological risk factors driving Hendra virus infection in P. alecto. More broadly, the findings add to the knowledge of Pteropus populations in terms of their relative resistance and resilience to emerging infectious disease.
9f7c607911ddb87ca96ce7934cace386e59381ff	Seven fragments of the spike (S) gene cDNA of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), as well as the full length cDNA, were cloned and expressed in baculovirus vectors. Piglets were immunized with cells infected with the recombinant viruses. Each of the recombinants induced TGEV-specific antibodies detected in a fixed cell enzyme immunoassay. The amino terminal half of the S protein, containing all four major antigenic sites (A, B, C and D), and encoded by a 2.2 kb fragment of the S gene, induced virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers comparable with those induced by the complete S protein. Recombinant proteins lacking the A antigenic site, or with a deletion including the putative receptor binding sites and the D antigenic site, were not capable of inducing levels of VN antibodies similar to those induced by the whole S protein.
9f05493734433385ff6082f0d4368b93a9a6b3df	Cystatins are thiol proteinase inhibitors (TPI), present ubiquitously in animals, plants and microorganisms. These are not merely inhibitors rather they are at heart of many pathological conditions ranging from diabetes to renal failure. These are essential for maintenance of protein balance of the cell; once this balance gets disturbed, it may lead to cell death. Thus, cystatins cannot be merely regarded as TPI's as these have been found to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies have reported the variation in cystatin level in incidences of different types of cancer; highlighting an important role played by these inhibitors in cancer development and progression. Cystatin C is increasingly replacing creatinine as a biomarker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) thereby highlighting the importance of this important inhibitor. Some recent studies have also reported the interaction pattern of various anti-cancer drugs with cystatins in a bid to find how these drugs affect this important inhibitors and whether these drugs have any side effect on cystatins. Thus, in this growing disease era it can be said that cystatins are no more just inhibitors blocking the activity of thiol proteases rather they play a pivotal role in variety of pathological conditions.
3d26060058234765d6cbd486736cac0eaeb04fd2	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified 3 pathogen causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hydroxychloroquine 4 (HCQ), an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 5 infection in vitro and tested in clinical studies. However, lung concentration (6.7 µg/mL) to 6 predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral 7 dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic 8 toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Here, we described a non-clinical study to investigate the 9 pharmacokinetics of a novel formulation of liposomal HCQ administrated by intratracheal 10 (IT) instillation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats which achieved 129.4 µg/g (C max ) in the lung. 11 Compared to unformulated HCQ administered intravenous (IV), liposomal HCQ with 12 normalized dose showed higher (~30-fold) lung exposure, longer (~2.5-fold) half-life in lung, 13 but lower blood exposure with ~20% of C max and 74% of AUC and lower heart exposure 14 with 24% of C max and 58% of AUC. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics results in an animal 15 model demonstrate the proof of concept that inhalable liposomal HCQ may provide clinical 16 benefit and serve as a potential treatment for COVID-19.
1b2d3f657a9e492887a83bdb1f692b2b3b1d0efc	Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a re-emerging zoonotic flavivirus that poses an increasing threat to global health and welfare due to rapid changes in climate and demography. Although the CCR2-CCL2 axis plays an important role in trafficking CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes to regulate immunopathological diseases, little is known about their role in monocyte trafficking during viral encephalitis caused by JEV infection. Here, we explored the role of CCR2 and its ligand CCL2 in JE caused by JEV infection using CCR2-and CCL2-ablated murine models. Somewhat surprisingly, the ablation of CCR2 and CCL2 resulted in starkly contrasting susceptibility to JE. CCR2 ablation induced enhanced resistance to JE, whereas CCL2 ablation highly increased susceptibility to JE. This contrasting regulation of JE progression by CCR2 and CCL2 was coupled to central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes and Ly-6G hi granulocytes. There was also enhanced expression of CC and CXC chemokines in the CNS of CCL2-ablated mice, which appeared to induce CNS infiltration of these cell populations. However, our data revealed that contrasting regulation of JE in CCR2-and CCL2-ablated mice was unlikely to be mediated by innate natural killer and adaptive T-cell responses. Furthermore, CCL2 produced by haematopoietic stem cell-derived leucocytes played a dominant role in CNS accumulation of Ly-6C hi monocytes in infected bone marrow chimeric models, thereby exacerbating JE progression. Collectively, our data indicate that CCL2 plays an essential role in conferring protection against JE caused by JEV infection. In addition, blockage of CCR2, but not CCL2, will aid in the development of strategies for prophylactics and therapeutics of JE.
cd6ca523fa86c494605720267f98e11b14b6dcbe	SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower blood oxygen levels even in patients without hypoxia requiring hospitalization. This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients that have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2. This may provide a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients. hypoxia, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on erythropoiesis has received limited attention. Preliminary modeling reports have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit heme metabolism and induce hemoglobin denaturation 14 . As such, hemoglobin alteration may compromise oxygencarrying capacity of red blood cells (RBCs) in COVID-19 patients resulting in hypoxia. The entry receptor ACE2, has been confirmed in RBCs by proteomic studies 15 . This suggests that RBCs might be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 virus, although they cannot support viral replication. RBCs can be directly invaded by pathogens (e.g. in malaria), resulting in hemolysis 16 . In support of this concept, structural protein damage and changes in RBC membrane lipids have been reported in COVID-19 patients 17 . In addition to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells via CD147 18 , a known RBC receptor for Plasmodium falciparum 19 . Lastly, CD26 was reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 spike 20 , which is involved in stress hematopoiesis 21 . In light of the above, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly invades RBCs. Hence, depletion of RBCs by SARS-CoV-2 may result in stress erythropoiesis as a compensatory mechanism to meet the oxygen supply, resulting in the abundance of erythroid precursors in the blood. Erythroid precursors are defined as CD71 + erythroid cells (CECs) co-expressing CD71 (the transferrin receptor) and CD235a (glycophorin A, erythroid lineage marker) in humans, and CD71 and TER119 in mice [22] [23] [24] . CECs are a heterogenous population of erythroid progenitors and precursors with a wide range of immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory properties 25 . We and others have reported that CECs compromise innate and adaptive immune responses against infections and tumors due to their immunosuppressive properties 24,26-30 . In addition, it has been shown that CECs can harbor infective HIV particles and the binding of HIV to CD235a mediates HIV trans-infection to CD4 + T cells 31 . However, whether these cells can be the target of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be explored.
60f1455bed921da2e4f3df7aae854cb8e142ff44	Viral gain-of-function mutations frequently evolve during laboratory experiments. Whether the specific mutations that evolve in the lab also evolve in nature and whether they have the same impact on evolution in the real world is unknown. We studied a model virus, bacteriophage λ, that repeatedly evolves to exploit a new host receptor under typical laboratory conditions. Here, we demonstrate that two residues of λ's J protein are required for the new function. In natural λ variants, these amino acid sites are highly diverse and evolve at high rates. Insertions and deletions at these locations are associated with phylogenetic patterns indicative of ecological diversification. Our results show that viral evolution in the laboratory mirrors that in nature and that laboratory experiments can be coupled with protein sequence analyses to identify the causes of viral evolution in the real world. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for widespread host-shift evolution in lambdoid viruses.

a967827dea28185cf34be19205e263cadad1c826	SARS-CoV-2 has recently been detected in feces, which indicates that wastewater may be used to monitor viral prevalence in the community. Here we use two different sampling methods to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater over a 17-day period and sequencing is used to infer viral ancestry. While SARS-CoV-2 is detected over the entire time course, viral RNA has been steadily decreasing over the last week, suggesting that state mandated social isolation is having a measurable impact on containment of the outbreak.
e49f64f806141d7a338d729c4eabf5a805972e19	NIOSH published a Federal Register Notice to explore the possibility of incorporating FDA required filtration tests for surgical masks (SMs) in the 42 CFR Part 84 respirator certification process. There have been no published studies comparing the filtration efficiency test methods used for NIOSH certification of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) with those used by the FDA for clearance of SMs. To address this issue, filtration efficiencies of "N95 FFRs" including six N95 FFR models and three surgical N95 FFR models, and three SM models were measured using the NIOSH NaCl aerosol test method, and FDA required particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) and bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) methods, and viral filtration efficiency (VFE) method. Five samples of each model were tested using each method. Both PFE and BFE tests were done using unneutralized particles as per FDA guidance document. PFE was measured using 0.1 µm size polystyrene latex particles and BFE with ∼3.0 µm size particles containing Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. VFE was obtained using ∼3.0 µm size particles containing phiX 174 as the challenge virus and Escherichia coli as the host. Results showed that the efficiencies measured by the NIOSH NaCl method for "N95 FFRs"were from 98.15-99.68% compared to 99.74-99.99% for PFE, 99.62-99.9% for BFE, and 99.8-99.9% for VFE methods. Efficiencies by the NIOSH NaCl method were significantly (p = <0.05) lower than the other methods. SMs showed lower efficiencies (54.72-88.40%) than "N95 FFRs" measured by the NIOSH NaCl method, while PFE, BFE, and VFE methods produced no significant difference. The above results show that the NIOSH NaCl method is relatively conservative and is able to identify poorly performing filtration devices. The higher efficiencies obtained using PFE, BFE and VFE methods show that adding these supplemental particle penetration methods will not improve respirator certification.
40dc3da27eb118aee19196c6ea6808aba5b8b0c3	The scientific community has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by rapidly undertaking 19 research to find effective strategies to reduce the burden of this disease. Encouragingly, 20 researchers from a diverse array of fields are collectively working towards this goal. Research 21 with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is undertaken in high containment laboratories, however, it is 22 often desirable to work with samples at lower containment levels. To facilitate the transfer of 23 infectious samples from high containment laboratories, we have tested methods commonly 24 used to inactivate virus and prepare the sample for additional experiments. Incubation at 80°C, 25 and a range of detergents and UV energies were successful at inactivating a high titre of 26 SARS-CoV-2. These protocols can provide a framework for in house inactivation of SARS-27 CoV-2 in other laboratories, ensuring the safe use of samples in lower containment levels. 28
638782e8cb724b8fced1569d568e4915bddc1634	a b s t r a c t Keywords: Red clover necrotic mosaic virus Dianthovirus Positive-strand RNA virus Frameshifting Cap-independent translation RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Long distance RNA-RNA interaction Bulged stem-loop RNA structure Programmed − 1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) is one viral translation strategy to express overlapping genes in positive-strand RNA viruses. Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) uses this strategy to express its replicase component protein p88. In this study, we used a cell-free translation system to map cis-acting RNA elements required for − 1 PRF. Our results show that a small stem-loop structure adjacent to the capindependent translation element in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of RCNMV RNA1 is required for − 1 PRF. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested that this stem-loop regulates − 1 PRF via base-pairing with complementary sequences in a bulged stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site. The existence of RNA elements responsible for − 1 PRF and the cap-independent translation of replicase proteins in the 3′ UTR of RNA1 might be important for switching translation to replication and for regulating the ratio of p88 to p27.

7d171622c9d0b28b55962be8d0eddfb64b2cabb7	The COVID-19 global pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and represents an urgent medical and social issue. Unfortunately, there is still not a single proven effective drug available, and therefore, current therapeutic guidelines recommend supportive care including oxygen administration and treatment with antibiotics. Recently, patients have been also treated with off-label therapies which comprise antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, antiparasitic agents and plasma from convalescent patients, all with controversial results. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and plays a pivotal role in viral replication processes. In this review, we discuss several aspects of the UPS and the effects of its inhibition with particular regard to the life cycle of the coronaviruses (CoVs). In fact, proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds, such as MG132, epoxomycin and bortezomib, may reduce the virus entry into the eucariotic cell, the synthesis of RNA, and the subsequent protein expression necessary for CoVs. Importantly, since UPS inhibitors reduce the cytokine storm associated with various inflammatory conditions, it is reasonable to assume that they might be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2, thus providing an additional tool to counteract both virus replication as well as its most deleterious consequences triggered by abnormal immunological response.
a08c9015013a742bba26c956ca36e73a0aad93b5	Air pollution is a major health problem and children are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects. Facemasks are one form of protection but, to be effective, they need to filter out airborne pollutants, fit the face well and be wearable. In this pilot study, we assess the perceived wearability of three facemasks (Vogmask, TuHao and ReSpimask) marketed in the UK as being designed to protect children against exposure to air pollution. Twenty-four primary school children wore each facemask during a standardised walking and running activity. After each activity, the children were asked to rate facemask wearability in terms of parameters, such as perceived comfort, hotness, breathability and fit. At the end of the trial, the children compared and identified their preferred facemask. The main complaint about the facemasks was the children's faces being too hot. The ReSpimask was most frequently reported as being perceived to be the hardest to breathe through. The TuHao facemask was the only adjustable strap mask assessed but was reported to be difficult to adjust. Facemasks with a nose clip were frequently rated highest for fit (TuHao and Vogmask). The patterned, cloth fabric Vogmask had significantly higher ratings for appearance and perceived fit. The results show children's perceptions of facemasks are highly affected by the facemask's design, hotness and perceived breathability. By making children's facemasks more appealing, breathable, cooler and improving their fit, wearability may be improved.
9ad519eab4388637307c920a1d88a4941bde6a60	Coronavirus Disease 2019 caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a crude case fatality rate of about 0.5-10% depending on locality. A few clinically approved drugs, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nafamostat, camostat, and ivermectin, exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and/or in a small number of patients. However, their clinical use may be limited by anti-SARS-CoV-2 50% maximal effective concentrations (EC50) that exceeded their achievable peak serum concentrations (Cmax), side effects, and/or availability. To find more immediately J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 available COVID-19 antivirals, we established a two-tier drug screening system that combines SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell viability assay, and applied it to screen a library consisting 1528 FDA-approved drugs. Cetilistat (anti-pancreatic lipase), diiodohydroxyquinoline (anti-parasitic), abiraterone acetate (synthetic androstane steroid), and bexarotene (antineoplastic retinoid) exhibited potent in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC50 1.13-2.01µM). Bexarotene demonstrated the highest Cmax:EC50 ratio (1.69) which was higher than those of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin. These results demonstrated the efficacy of the two-tier screening system and identified potential COVID-19 treatments which can achieve effective levels if given by inhalation or systemically depending on their pharmacokinetics.
08f99c1ca0124bdbedcc51c3d096622423a484a3	A large number of healthcare workers have been infected with coronavirus disease-2019 . We aimed to investigate their clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) characteristics. The clinical, laboratory test and CT features of 43 medical and hospital staff with confirmed COVID-19 (MP group, 26-70 years old) were retrospectively analyzed, and compared to 43 non-medical related patients (non-MP group, 26-71 years old). Follow-up CT characteristics were analyzed to assess the disease progression in the period of hospitalization. At admission, the main complaints of the MP group, including fever (81.4%), fatigue (48.8%) and cough (41.9%), were similar to the non-MP group. The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in the non-MP group than the MP group (17.5 ± 22.4 mg/L, 20.2 ± 23.4 mm/H and 219 ± 66U/L, respectively, P < .05). Ground-grass opacities, consolidation, interstitial thickening were common CT features of both groups. The severity of opacities on initial CT were less in the MP group (5.3 ± 3.9 scores) than in the non-MP group (9.1 ± 4.8 scores, P < .05). Before regular treatments, the sum score of the opacities showed weak to moderate correlations with duration, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels (R ranged from 0.341-0.651, P < .05). In the study time window, the duration from illness onset to when the most obvious pulmonary opacities were observed, according to CT findings, were similar in the MP group (13.3 ± 6.6 days) and the non-MP group (13.8 ± 5.1 days, P = .69). Mild to moderate anxiety and depression were observed in both groups. Despite greater knowledge of how to protect themselves than the general population, healthcare workers are also susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Occupational exposure is a very important factor. Healthcare workers have a higher vigilance about the infection in the early stage of the disease. Abbreviations: COVID-19 = coronavirus disease-2019, CRP = C-reactive protein, CT = computed tomography, ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate, LDH = lactate dehydrogenase.
bdd1ae2ed69133d4fd4b545622e0fa9c6565ef3c	Currently, designing antiviral drugs remains a topical problem because of a wide distribution of HIV infection, viral hepatites, and appearance of new viral infections (including those induced by coronaviruses). The special attention of researchers is attracted by the fluorine-containing heterocyclic compounds, which exhibit a unique set of proportions, because the presence of the fluorine atom increases their solubility in lipids and ability to penetrate across cell membranes [1] . The compounds of the benzimidazole series occupy a key position among the known drugs. For example, the spasmolytic dibazol, neuroleptics pimozide and droperidol, antihistamine drug astemizol, and highly effective antiulcerogenic drug omeprazol are widely used in medicine [2] . Benzimidazole derivatives (including fluorine-containing compounds) that exhibit antiviral activity against herpes virus were found [3] [4] [5] . In this work, we studied the antiviral activity of new fluorine-containing derivatives of benz [4, 5] imidazo[1,2b ][1,3]thiazoles ( 1a-1n ) against the measles virus. The synthesis of the compounds analyzed was described by us earlier [6] . Antiviral activity of these compounds was studied in vitro in Vero green marmoset kidney cells against the measles virus strain Leningrad 16. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates (Costar, the United States) in a DMEM nutrient medium supplemented with 2% bovine fetal serum (ICN, the United States), 100 µ g/ml gentamycin, and 60 µ g/ml lincomycin at 37°ë in 5% ëé 2 . When monolayer was formed, the virus (infection multiplicity, 0.2-0.5 infective units per cell) and the compound tested (concentration, 0.1-400 µ g/ml) were added to wells. Cells were incubated at 37°ë for 5 days in 5% ëé 2 and then stained with crystalline violet (1.3 g of the dye, 50 ml of ethanol, water to 700 ml, and 300 ml of 40% formalin) for 1.5 h. Optical density was determined on a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 570 nm. Based of the data obtained, 50% toxic ( CD 50 ) and effective ( ED 50 ) doses of compounds were calculated [7]; the therapeutic index (IS) was determined as CD 50 /ED 50 . The results of study of antiviral activity and cytotoxicity of 2-aroyl-3-methyl-6,7-difluorobenz[4,5]imidazo[2,1b ][1,3]thiazoles ( 1a-1n ) are summarized in Table 1 . Ribavirin (1-( β -d-ribofuranosyl-10-1,2,4-triazol-3-carboxamide)), which is commonly used for treating infections induced by RNA-containing viruses (including heavy forms of measles) [8] , was used as a reference drug. However, the use of this drug is limited by its high toxicity. Out of 14 compounds studied, compound 1a exhibited the greatest activity: its therapeutic index was much greater than that of ribavirin (245.5 and 14.4, respectively). Lower activity was exhibited by compound 1b ; the other compounds had low activity or were ineffective. We studied the antiviral activity of compound 1a depending on the time of its addition to culture medium. The tested compound was added one day before virus adsorption, simultaneously with the virus, immediately after virus adsorption, and 6 h and one day after virus adsorption. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 2 . It is seen that preliminary treatment of cells with the compound did not protect cells
330f5320d6c625aa2a3edb0a23371b253a7de1e7	The COVID-19 epidemic is currently spreading around the world, with more than two million people infected and more than 190,000 dead. 1 In order to early identify the deterioration in patients with COVID-19 and allow timely escalation, we evaluated the ability of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 to predict the deterioration of patients with COVID-19. A prospective study was conducted on 200 patients with COVID-19 in Xiangya Ward of Wuhan Xiehe West hospital. The vital signs, blood oxygen saturation and other parameters were collected at the time of admission. The data included demographic data, clinical characteristics, clinical classification of COVID-19, and serious events (SEs) (death or unplanned transfer to Intensive Care or initiation of non-invasive ventilation) during the whole hospitalization. 3 The area under the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
162ffba72e95c4b2686b0b273b47c376aad61ba7	Myeloid cells represent a diverse range of innate leukocytes that are crucial for mounting successful immune responses against viruses. These cells are responsible for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns, thereby initiating a signaling cascade that results in the production of cytokines such as interferons to mitigate infections. The aim of this review is to outline recent advances in our knowledge of the roles that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes play in initiating and coordinating host responses against viral infections. A focus is placed on myeloid cell development, trafficking and antiviral mechanisms. Although known for promoting inflammation, there is a growing body of literature which demonstrates that myeloid cells can also play critical regulatory or immunosuppressive roles, especially following the elimination of viruses. Additionally, the ability of myeloid cells to control other innate and adaptive leukocytes during viral infections situates these cells as key, yet under-appreciated mediators of pathogenic inflammation that can sometimes trigger cytokine storms. The information presented here should assist researchers in integrating myeloid cell biology into the design of novel and more effective virus-targeted therapies.
ef5098e6a4aedd57c1b9217b700c7836e5bf18ae	Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease patients, including risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and to evaluate the need for rehabilitation to prevent pulmonary embolism. Methods: A retrospective medical record review was conducted of patients admitted to the study hospital with COVID-19 between April 2 and April 23, 2020. The clinical characteristics and blood test results of patients with no history on admission of oral anticoagulant use were evaluated to assess the importance of inflammation and clotting function as risk factors for pulmonary embolism. Results: A total of 51 patients with COVID-19 were admitted during the study period. Their median age was 54.0 years (range: 41-63 years) and 38 of 51 (74.5%) were men. The most common comorbidities in men were diabetes (9/38, 23.7%) and hypertension (13/38, 34.2%). On admission, white blood cell counts were normal in both sexes, whereas C-reactive protein and hemostatic marker levels, except for the activated partial thromboplastin time, were significantly higher in men. Moreover, C-reactive protein and hemostatic marker levels were significantly higher in patients that required invasive ventilation. Two patients were diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, neither of whom required invasive ventilation. Conclusions: Hypercoagulability and hyperinflammation were observed in COVID-19 patients, especially in men with high oxygen demand. We recommend anticoagulant therapy and early rehabilitation intervention to prevent pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients.
6b749617eb4a9f2760720a1b2a061cd0d45f9e3f	Background: It is widely understood that tumor cells express tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), of which many are usually in low immunogenicity; for example, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is specifically expressed on human colon cancer cells and is viewed as a low-immunogenic TAA. How to activate host immunity against specific TAAs and to suppress tumor growth therefore becomes important in cancer therapy development. Results: To enhance the immune efficiency of CEA in mice that received, we fused a partial CEA gene with exogenous SARS-CoV fragments. Oral vaccination of an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain transformed with plasmids encoding CEA-SARS-CoV fusion gene into BALB/c mice elicited significant increases in TNF-α and IL-10 in the serum. In addition, a smaller tumor volume was observed in CT26/CEA-bearing mice who received CEA-SARS-CoV gene therapy in comparison with those administered CEA alone. The administration of fusing CEA-SARS-CoV fragments may provide a promising strategy for strengthening the anti-tumor efficacy against low-immunogenic endogenous tumor antigens.
c82ec02004690f5dcfbfde514e689899b247dcab	Background: Extracorporeal blood purification has been proposed as one of the therapeutic approaches in patients with coronavirus infection, because of its beneficial impact on elimination of inflammatory cytokines. Methods: This controlled trial has been conducted on critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted in the state hospital affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences, Iran who received different antiviral and antibacterial drugs, and different modalities of respiratory treatments and did not have positive clinical improvement. No randomization and blindness was considered. All of the participants underwent three sessions of resin-directed hemoperfusion using continuous renal replacement therapy with a mode of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). Results: Five men and five women with a mean age of 57.30 ± 18.07 years have been enrolled in the study; and six of them have improved after the intervention. Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) changed after each session. Mean SpO2 before the three sessions of hemoperfusion was 89.60% ± 3.94% and increased to 92.13% ± 3.28% after them (p < 0.001). Serum IL-6 showed a reduction from 139.70 ± 105.62 to 72.06 ± 65.87 pg/mL (p = 0.073); and c-reactive protein decreased from 136.25 ± 84.39 to 78.25 ± 38.67 mg/L (P = 0.016). Conclusions: Extracorporeal hemoadsorption could improve the general condition in most of recruited patients with severe coronavirus disease; however, large prospective multicenter trials in carefully selected patients are needed to definitely evaluate the efficacy of hemoperfusion in COVID-19 patients. Trial registration: The research protocol has been registered in the website of Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with the reference number IRCT20150704023055N2.
cf34f088df2633b8f581a0040f1feb40ad3918f3	Since its emergence in December 2019, it took only a couple of months for an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). This along with the highly infectious nature of the disease and the associated mortality call for particular attention to the underlying (immuno)pathomechanism(s). The latter will inform case management and vaccine design. Unravelling these mechanisms can assist basic scientists, laboratory medicine practitioners, clinicians, public health practitioners, funding agencies, and health care policymakers in responding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.

d4d33e64a1c4780b4ded01726c945f36914cf87a	Here we describe a novel immunogenic method to detect COVID-19. The method is a chromogenic magnetic bead-based ELISA which allows inexpensive and quantitative detection of human IgG or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum or whole blood samples in just 12 minutes. As a proof of concept, we compared the performance of our new method to classical ELISA. Person correlation between optical densities obtained using the two methods was 0.98, the color intensity observed in the novel method correlated with antibody titers determined by classical ELISA. The novel magnetic bead-based ELISA correctly classified all 6 positive COVID-19 samples tested and showed 100% specificity as judged by the analysis of a cohort of 26 negative samples. The magnetic bead-based ELISA performed better than classic ELISA to discriminate COVID-19 positive serum with low antibody titer. The chromogenic magnetic bead-based ELISA method described here can be applied to both point of care and high throughput analysis. The method is readily adaptable to be used with other protein and peptide-based antigens.
4bf165f82a8648b69169a66114d29c690f0562e0	Background: Information on early recovery after arthroplasty is needed to help benchmark progress and make appropriate decisions concerning patient rehabilitation needs. The purpose of this study was to model early recovery of physical function in patients undergoing total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty, using physical performance and self-report measures. A sample of convenience of 152 subjects completed testing, of which 69 (mean age: 66.77 ± 8.23 years) underwent THA and 83 (mean age: 60.25 ± 11.19 years) TKA. Postoperatively, patients were treated using standardized care pathways and rehabilitation protocols. Using a repeated measures design, patients were assessed at multiple time points over the first four postoperative months. Outcome measures included the Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS), the physical function subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC PF), the 6 minute walk test (6 MWT), timed up and go test (TUG) and a timed stair test (ST). Average recovery curves for each of the measures were characterized using hierarchical linear modeling. Predictors of recovery were sequentially modeled after validation of the basic developmental models. Slopes of recovery were greater in the first 6 to 9 weeks with a second-degree polynomial growth term (weeks squared) providing a reasonable fit for the data over the study interval. Different patterns of recovery were observed between the self-report measures of physical function and the performance measures. In contrast to the models for the WOMAC PF and the LEFS, site of arthroplasty was a significant predictor (p = 0.001) in all of the physical performance measure models with the patients post TKA initially demonstrating higher function. Site of arthroplasty (p = 0.025) also predicted the rate of change for patients post THA and between 9 to 11 weeks after surgery, the THA group surpassed the function of the patients post TKA. Knowledge about the predicted growth curves will assist clinicians in referencing patient progress, and determining the critical time points for measuring change. The study has contributed further evidence to highlight the benefit of using physical performance measures to learn about the patients' actual level of disability.
0261056f80c5174c5ed627a75df33d1a9b69cdd9	Size reduction mechanisms are very important in several mathematical fields. In rough set theory, bireducts arose to reduce simultaneously the set of attributes and the set of objects of the considered dataset, providing subsystems with the minimal sets of attributes that connect the maximum number of objects preserving the information of the original dataset. This paper presents the main properties of bireducts and how they can be used for removing inconsistencies.
5b889b5e979a0b32228441c2fb350b5357134712	On the basis of our previous study on antiviral agents against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a series of nucleoside analogues whose 5 0 -hydroxyl groups are masked by various protective groups such as carboxylate, sulfonate, and ether were synthesized and evaluated to develop novel anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agents. Among these, several 5 0 -O-masked analogues of 6-chloropurine-2 0 -deoxyriboside (e.g., 5 0 -O-benzoyl, 5 0 -O-p-methoxybenzoyl, and 5 0 -O-benzyl analogues) were found to exhibit effective anti-HCV activity. In particular, the 5 0 -O-benzoyl analogue exhibited the highest potency with an EC 50 of 6.1 lM in a cell-based HCV replicon assay. Since the 5 0 -O-unmasked analogue (i.e., 6-chloropurine-2 0 -deoxyriboside) was not sufficiently potent (EC 50 = 47.2 lM), masking of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group seems to be an effective method for the development of anti-HCV agents. Presently, we hypothesize two roles for the 5 0 -O-masked analogues: One is the role as an anti-HCV agent by itself, and the other is as a prodrug of its 5 0 -O-demasked (deprotected) derivative.

Kurzfristig hat die Bundesregierung mit temporären Ausnahmeregelungen bei den subjektorientierten Instrumenten sowie im Miet-und Darlehensrecht reagiert. Es zeigt sich jedoch, dass weitere temporäre Regelungen geboten sind. Aufgrund der großen Relevanz von nachfrageseitigen Entwicklungen ist im Verlauf der Rezession mit ausgeprägten Preisrückgängen auf den Wohnungsmärkten zu rechnen, die potenziell jedoch durch eine langfristig neu einsetzende Arbeitsmigration revidiert werden. Die Wohnungspolitik ist daher gut beraten, ihre Wohnungsbauaktivitäten zu stabilisieren bzw. antizyklisch auszurichten, um die langfristigen Wohnungsbedarfe auch bei wieder aufl ebender Zuwanderung decken zu können. Abstract: The coronavirus pandemic and the associated containment measures are likely to have serious effects on housing. In the short term, the German Federal Government has reacted with temporary exemptions for subject -oriented instruments as well as for rental and lending regulations. However, it has become apparent that further temporary regulations are needed within the scope of social security of housing. In the course of the recession, pronounced price declines on the housing markets are to be expected due to the great relevance of demand side developments. However, long term labour migration will potentially revise the price declines. Housing policymakers would therefore be advised to stabilise housing construction activities or to orient them countercyclically in order to be able to cover long term housing needs that will emerge by resurgent immigration.

7688b1a7662e60226e0011fe6262f6d9114e1906	Synthetic biology, application of synthetic chemistry to biology, is a broad term that covers the engineering of biological systems with structures and functions not found in nature to process information, manipulate chemicals, produce energy, maintain cell environment and enhance human health. Synthetic biology devices contribute not only to improve our understanding of disease mechanisms, but also provide novel diagnostic tools. Methods based on synthetic biology enable the design of novel strategies for the treatment of cancer, immune diseases metabolic disorders and infectious diseases as well as the production of cheap drugs. The potential of synthetic genome, using an expanded genetic code that is designed for specific drug synthesis as well as delivery and activation of the drug in vivo by a pathological signal, was already pointed out during a lecture delivered at Kuwait University in 2005. Of two approaches to synthetic biology, top-down and bottom-up, the latter is more relevant to the development of personalized medicines as it provides more flexibility in constructing a partially synthetic cell from basic building blocks for a desired task.
52e898e9b4110cbc6a8beac32cd86672f96489ca	Background: Dengue is a major public health problem in the tropics and sub-tropics, but the disease is less known to non-dengue-endemic countries including in Northeast Asia. However, an unexpected dengue outbreak occurred in 2014 in Japan. Given that autochthonous (domestic) dengue cases had not been reported for the past 70 years in Japan, this outbreak was highly unusual and suggests that several environmental factors might have changed in a way that favors vector mosquitoes in the Northeast Asian region. Methods: A Climate Risk Factor (CRF) index, as validated in previous work, was constructed using climate and nonclimate factors. This CRF index was compared to the number of reported dengue cases in Tokyo, Japan where the outbreak was observed in 2014. In order to identify high-risk areas, the CRF index was further estimated at the 5 km by 5 km resolution and mapped for Japan and South Korea. Results: The high-risk areas determined by the CRF index corresponded well to the provinces where a high number of autochthonous cases were reported during the outbreak in Japan. At the provincial-level, high-risk areas for dengue fever were the Eastern part of Tokyo and Kanakawa, the South-Eastern part of Saitama, and the North-Western part of Chiba. While a relatively small number of high-risk areas were identified in South Korea compared with Japan, the highrisk areas in South Korea include popular tourist destinations where international visitors have been increasing. Conclusion: The recent dengue outbreak in Japan may signal that the two adjacent non-dengue-endemic countries are also exposed to the risk of temporal and sporadic behavior of dengue fever. It is critical to understand potential high-risk areas for future outbreaks and to set up appropriate prevention activities at the governmental-level.
cb22558ac58c43426eebd6a86dd22201c1977005	In the control of infectious diseases, epidemiologic information and useful clustering algorithms can be integrated to garner key indicators from huge amounts of daily surveillance information for the need of early intervention. This chapter first introduces the temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal clustering algorithms commonly used in surveillance systems -the key concepts behind the algorithms and the criteria for appropriate use. This description is followed by an introduction to different statistical methods that can be used to analyze the clustering patterns which occur in different epidemics and epidemic stages. Research methods such as flexible analysis of irregular spatial and temporal clusters, adjustment of personal risk factors, and Bayesian approaches to disease mapping and better prediction all will be needed to understand the epidemiologic characteristics of infectious diseases in the future.
95b1f681cfe2bb33c6433b07cd38f0ed3ce3667d	Sialic acids, terminal sugars of glycoproteins and glycolipids, play important roles in development, cellular recognition processes and host-pathogen interactions. A common modification of sialic acids is 9-O-acetylation, which has been implicated in sialoglycan recognition, ganglioside biology, and the survival and drug resistance of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. Despite many functional implications, the molecular basis of 9-O-acetylation has remained elusive thus far. Following cellular approaches, including selective gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we here show that CASD1-a previously identified human candidate gene-is essential for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation. In vitro assays with the purified N-terminal luminal domain of CASD1 demonstrate transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme A to CMP-activated sialic acid and formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate. Our study provides direct evidence that CASD1 is a sialate O-acetyltransferase and serves as key enzyme in the biosynthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans.
ce2862ac3e64630de40d7b761338825651bbe867	Vajont dam was an important industrial project for post-war Italy. A general plan was proposed for the erection of seven dams in Piave valley, but from the beginning of the Vajont dam development, the project met with fierce resistance from local communities protesting against the forced sale of land to Società Adriatica di Elettricità (SADE) to construct the highest arch dam in the world. SADE, a private electricity company in North-Eastern Italy, had support from Democrazia Cristiana (the Italian Christian democratic political party, which promoted pro-American and pro-capitalist ideology and was in power at the time). Opposition from locals in villages around the Vajont reservoir was suppressed by the police. After this, the Italian Communist Party, the main opponent of Democrazia Cristiana, stayed on the side of local residents and supported their struggle against SADE and the government during the construction of the dam. 2 Engineers and geologists focused on the permeability of the Vajont dam foundation, but did not study carefully the geology and the stability of the slopes surrounding the upstream reservoir of the dam, which consisted of soft materials like sand, limestone and clay. 3 The geological instability of the surrounding mountains was well known among local residents 4 : Mt. Toc had many nicknames like "crazy", "rotten", "loose" or "walking mountain" among local people due to its propensity for huge unexpected landslides. 5,6 The construction of the dam was launched in January 1957 with the goal of completing it by 1959 (construction started without government approval, nor serious geological research of the surrounding mountains). Moreover, to meet the need of Italian industry for electricity and maximize the profitability of the project, SADE proposed to increase the height of the dam up to 722.5 m, and triple the volume of the reservoir. In June 1957, government approval was obtained for construction without a geological study of the consequences of expanding the reservoir. In March 1959 in the nearby Pontesei dam reservoir (owned by SADE), a landslide of 10 million m 3 of rock occurred (equivalent of cube with a 220 m side), resulting in the death of one worker, killed by a 20-m wave which overtopped the dam and destroyed a nearby bridge. Moreover, clefts were discovered during mountain road constructions around the Vajont reservoir. Protests from local residents against SADE broke out again. In May 1959, l'Unità (the official newspaper of the Italian Communist Party) conjectured that the Pontesei dam accident could 2 Rose Marco Delle, Decision-making errors and socio-political disputes over the Vajont dam disaster, Disaster 11 7 Rose Marco Delle, Decision-making errors and socio-political disputes over the Vajont dam disaster, Disaster

In the present study, lO-week-old seronegative pigs (n = 8), pigs immune ./o/lowing TGEV inoculation (n = 4) or pigs immune following aerosol (n = 8) or intragastrie inoculation (n = 4) with PRCV were challenged with TGEV. Whereas TGEV-immune pigs were completely protected against challenge, all PRCV-immune pigs showed serological evidence of TGEV replication. Nevertheless, the aerosol or intragastric inoculation with PRCV primed the humoral immune system against TGEV and the TGEV challenge induced a secondary antibody response in most PRCV-immune pigs. Furthermore, all PRCV-immune pigs showed a decrease in the duration of the excretion of infectious TGEV (0-4 days) in comparison with the duration of the virus excretion by seronegative pigs (5-6 days).
f6e8b44f19fd28de061592f560371c1a8796dc13	Next-generation sequencing has been used in numerous investigations to characterize and quantify the genetic diversity of a virus sample through the mapping of polymorphisms and measurement of mutation frequencies. Next-generation sequencing has also been employed to identify recombination events occurring within the genomes of higher organisms, for example, detecting alternative RNA splicing events and oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we combine these two approaches to profile RNA recombination within the encapsidated genome of a eukaryotic RNA virus, flock house virus. We detect hundreds of thousands of recombination events, with single-nucleotide resolution, which result in diversity in the encapsidated genome rivaling that due to mismatch mutation. We detect previously identified defective RNAs as well as many other abundant and novel defective RNAs. Our approach is exceptionally sensitive and unbiased and requires no prior knowledge beyond the virus genome sequence. RNA recombination is a powerful driving force behind the evolution and adaptation of RNA viruses. The strategy implemented here is widely applicable and provides a highly detailed description of the complex mutational landscape of the transmissible viral genome.
c0bac4996407b07bc1c3fd5ba454d75a4145f95e	The development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological tests is massive. The external validation of their performance is needed before use in clinical routine practice. Our study aims at assessing the analytical and clinical performance of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests detecting antibodies directed against the virus nucleocapsid protein: The NovaLisa SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) test (NovaTec) allowing a separate detection of each antibody and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test (Bio-Rad) detecting total antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG). Two-hundred and eight coronavirus disease 2019 samples from 48 quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed patients were used to perform the sensitivity analysis. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 79) with a potential cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were included in the specificity analysis. In addition, using receiver operator characteristic curves, adapted cut-off for improvement of the performances were proposed. The kinetics of these antibodies was also assessed over 8 weeks. Two weeks after the RT-qPCR positive detection, the NovaLisa test shows a sensitivity and specificity of 94.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.1%-98.6%) and 96.2% (95% CI: 89.4%-98.7%) for IgG, of 89.7% (95% CI: 76.4%-95.9%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.2%-98.8%) for IgA, and of 48.7% (95% CI: 33.9%-63.8%) and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.2%-99.8%) for IgM. With the Platelia system, the specificity and sensitivity were 97.4% (95% CI: 92.1%-99.7%) and 94.9% (95% CI: 87.7%-98.0%) for total antibodies using the adapted cut-offs. The NovaLisa and the Platelia tests have satisfactory analytical performances. The clinical performances are excellent for IgG, IgA, and total antibodies especially if the cut-off is optimized.
ec39cedb4ad5ef85eee12e2d407bf8e4da9da950	Genome-scale orthology assignments are usually based on reciprocal best matches. In the absence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), every pair of orthologs forms a reciprocal best match. Incorrect orthology assignments therefore are always false positives in the Reciprocal Best Match Graph. We consider duplication/loss scenarios and characterize unambiguous false-positive (u-fp) orthology assignments, that is, edges in the Best Match Graphs (BMGs) that cannot correspond to orthologs for any gene tree that explains the BMG. We characterize u-fp edges in terms of subgraphs of the BMG and show that, given a BMG, there is a unique "augmented tree" that explains the BMG and identifies all u-fp edges in terms of overlapping sets of species in certain subtrees. The augmented tree can be constructed as a refinement of the unique least resolved tree of the BMG in polynomial time. Removal of the u-fp edges from the reciprocal best matches results in a unique orthology assignment. The orthology relation itself has been characterized as a cograph (i.e., graphs that do not contain induced paths P 4 on four vertices) by Hellmuth et al. [22] based on earlier work by Böcker and Dress [2] . This line of research has led to the idea of editing reciprocal best hit data to conform the require cograph structure [23] . Maybe surprisingly, the combinatorial structure of best matches has become a focus only very recently. We consider best matches as an evolutionary concept: A gene y in species s is a best match of a gene x from species r = s if s contains no gene y that is more closely related to x. In practice, best matches are approximated by sequence similarity. We refer to [46] and the references therein for a detailed account on how best matches can be extracted from sequence similarity data. Best Match Graphs (BMGs) have several appealing properties: They have several alternative characterizations providing polynomial-time recognition algorithms and they are "explained" by a unique least resolved tree [12] . These properties will be introduced formally in the next section and play an important role in our discussion. The Reciprocal Best Match Graphs (RBMGs) are the symmetric parts of BMGs and conceptually correspond to the reciprocal best hits used in orthology detection. In contrast to BMGs, RBMGs are much more difficult to handle and are not associated with unique trees [14] . RBMGs in general are not cographs and thus contain incorrect orthology assignments associated with P 4 s. Importantly, such incorrect assignments are always false positives and thus, correspond to edges in RBMGs that must be deleted [13] . A P 4 in an RBMG arises in particular as a consequence of complementary gene loss, i.e., the complete loss of different paralogous groups in disjoint lineages. Under certain circumstances, such false-positive orthology assignments can be identified, in particular when there are also species in which both paralogs have survived [6] . A subset of false-positive orthology assignments, the "good quartets", can be identified unambiguously by considering BMGs instead of RBMGs [14] . Their removal already leads to a substantial improvement in simulated data [13] . Here, we consider the false-positive orthology assignments in more detail, using BMGs and their explaining trees as the formal framework. Section 3.2 introduces the notion of unambiguous false-positive edges, that is, reciprocal best matches that cannot be orthologs w.r.t. to any gene tree explaining the BMG. For BMGs that can be explained by fully resolved, i.e., binary gene trees, Thm. 3.9 shows that unambiguous false-positive are already determined by this particular gene tree. Furthermore, we will see in Prop. 3.15 that these false positives are the middle edges of a good quartet or one of the outer edges of an ugly quartet [13, 14] . This leaves unambiguous false-positive edges in BMGs that have no explanation by a binary tree, i.e., that require hard polytomies in the evolutionary scenario. In Section 3.5 we show that these false-positives are associated with another class of induced subgraphs of the BMG, which we termed hourglasses. Thm. 4.5 then provides an additional set of false-positive edges that are embedded in chains of hourglasses in a certain manner. The gene tree T "displays" two trees that play a key role for our purposes: the discriminating cotree of the orthology cograph and the least resolved tree of the BMG. While the first can be endowed with an unambiguous event labeling, this not true for the latter [13] . The least resolved tree may contain polytomic vertices arising by the merging of speciation and duplication events. This leads us to the construction of a unique augmented tree in Section 4.3, which can be endowed with an unambiguous event labeling and thus, induces a unique cograph. Thm. 4.19 states that a reciprocal best match is an unambiguous false-positive if and only if it is not contained in the cograph induced by augmented tree. Algorithm 1 furthermore computes the augmented tree in polynomial time from the least resolved tree of the BMG, resulting a polynomial-time procedure to identify all unambiguous false-positive edges in a BMG. In simulations, we find that at least three quarters of all false positives fall into this class. The remaining cases are not recognizable from best matches alone and correspond to complementary losses without surviving witnesses.
7f6d6d5cf7a484c164c955ff15a32758e1ab3943	The Postgraduate Year (PGY) Program allows doctors-in-training to learn about the diagnosis, treatment and nursing of various common, general diseases. These items form the core curriculum and are mostly learned through caring for patients and clinical teaching. Doctorsin-training are evaluated for their knowledge through written tests or assignments, based on which the effectiveness of their training is also assessed; however, this generally produces a negative learning attitude among them. So we introduced the flipped classroom into PGY training program to change PGY students' learning behavior. Although the flipped classroom is highly valued and has been practiced by teachers in schools of various levels, very few attempts have been made until now to report the learning outcomes achieved through the flipped classroom by means of rigorous research methods. Therefore we tried to employed Ajzen and Fishbein's (1980) theory of reasoned action and Bandura's self-efficacy to predict and explain the participants' behavioral intention when participating in the core curriculum learning of the flipped classroom and to assess the change in students' learning behavior and learning effectiveness. From August 2013 to July 2014, 39 PGY students from the General Surgery of the Tri-Service General Hospital were selected as the participants of this study. The control group included 43 students of the previous year, that is, the year before the intervention of the flipped classroom. A comparative analysis was performed. The questionnaire's related matrices indicated highest correlation between self-efficacy and behavioral intention (r = 0.491, P < 0.01), followed by attitude (r = 0.365, P < 0.01) and subjective norms (r = 0.360, P < 0.01.) All three showed positive correlations with behavioral intention; among attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy, the pairwise correlations also reached significance level. The flipped classroom can indeed change PGY students' the learning behavior from "passive learning" to "active learning." PLOS ONE |
971775a96494a12f91b70fd4b8ccaa461a5f0f98	Ligand-receptor interactions are customarily described by equations that apply to solutes. Yet, most receptors are present in cell membranes so that sufficiently lipophilic ligands could reach the receptor by a two-dimensional approach within the membrane. As summarized in this review, this may affect the ligand-receptor interaction in many ways. Biophysicians calculated that, compared to a threedimensional approach from the liquid phase, such approach could alter the time the ligands need to find a receptor. Biochemists found that ligand incorporation in lipid bilayers modifies their conformation. This, along with the depth at which the ligands reside in the bilayer, will affect the probability of successful receptor interaction. Novel mechanisms were also introduced, including "exosite" binding and ligand translocation between the receptor's ␣-helical transmembrane domains. Pharmacologists focused attention at ligand concentrations in membrane, their adsorption and release rates and the effects thereof on ligand potency and residence time at the receptor. (G. Vauquelin). physics, biochemistry, pharmacology, biology and chemistry have contributed to a better knowledge of how membranes may affect ligand-receptor (as well as substrate-enzyme) interactions at the molecular level. The ambition of this review is to integrate the outcomes of these studies in a single comprehensive monograph and, by doing so, to stimulate interdisciplinary cross-talks on this far from obsolete topic.
2105c805d6a0a560348c1bb6bf620685944ba9dc	Lipid rafts are membrane domains, more ordered than the bulk membrane and enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. They represent a platform for protein-lipid and proteinprotein interactions and for cellular signaling events. In addition to their normal functions, including membrane trafficking, ligand binding (including viruses), axonal development and maintenance of synaptic integrity, rafts have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipid rafts promote interaction of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the secretase (BACE-1) responsible for generation of the amyloid β peptide, Aβ. Rafts also regulate cholinergic signaling as well as acetylcholinesterase and Aβ interaction. In addition, such major lipid raft components as cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside have been directly implicated in pathogenesis of the disease. Perturbation of lipid raft integrity can also affect various signaling pathways leading to cellular death and AD. In this review, we discuss modulation of APP cleavage by lipid rafts and their components, while also looking at more recent findings on the role of lipid rafts in signaling events.
16ce47b288146798aedfc913ce3ade7879b964b7	Monte Carlo techniques have long been employed to simulate the nature of electron scattering in solid materials. These simulations, in turn, have been used to predict parameters for electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis such as electron and x-ray ranges and backscattered electron yields. Monte Carlo techniques have also been used to predict analytical behavior in unconventional specimens, such as thin films and particles (e.g., relative intensity as a function of particle size). However, because of limitations in the physical models and lengthy calculations involved, Monte Carlo techniques have only very rarely been applied to actually correct quantitative analysis data. We have explored the practicality of developing a Monte Carlo technique-based correction procedure for microbeam analysis and the current state of accuracy of Monte Carlobased corrections versus "conventional" corrections. By using a simple but accurate numerical approximation for the relative elastic scattering cross section as a function of Z and E, it is possible to develop Monte Carlo procedures to calculate trajectories in multiple-element samples with the same speed as for single element standards. Modern expressions for the ionization cross section and the electron energy loss (particularly at low energies) have significantly improved the agreement between Monte Carlo calculations and experimentally-measured data. Monte Carlo algorithms that produce the same level of accuracy in correcting conventional electron microbeam analyses of thick, polished specimens and thin films are the best of the currently used correction procedures, and are of superior accuracy in the analysis of small particles and samples at multiple accelerating potentials. By combining polynomial a-factors with Monte Carlo-based algorithms in an iterative correction scheme, it is now possible with a fast desktop, PCtype computer to perform practical, online, Monte Carlo data processing. Gauvin et al. (1992) have shown that spherical inclusions embedded in a matrix can be chemically quantified by x-ray IV-1 Charleston, South Carolina, USA microanalysis in the scanning electron microscope using a quantitative procedure similar to that developed by Kyser and Murata (1976) for the quantitative analysis of thin films deposited on a substrate. These quantitative procedures are based on calibration curves obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. A generalized Monte Carlo code allows quantitative analysis of spherical inclusions as well as elliptic inclusions embedded in a metallic matrix, simulations of emitted x-rays and backscattered electrons from these materials, including line scans and images, and a consideration of the effects of inclusion size, shape, composition, matrix composition, and the fractal behavior of electron trajectories in these materials.

ff32cab0923f0e114df2280408f22aa3353073a1	Background: H5N1 avian influenza may become pandemic in humans in the near future. According to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience, anticipation of the pandemic may have impact on behaviors related to influenza vaccination (IV) and relevant public health behaviors such as wearing a face mask when having influenza-like-illnesses (ILI), which would play an important role in the control of human avian influenza outbreaks. This paper investigated the prevalence and factors related to IV uptake and use of face mask in public venues when having ILI symptoms. Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional population-based random telephone survey of 302 Hong Kong Chinese adults aged 18-60, using a structured questionnaire, was conducted in November 2005. Results: In the last 3 months, 17.9% of the respondents received IV; 36.6% of those presenting ILI symptoms often used face mask in public venues. Anticipation of a bird-tohuman H5N1 outbreak, perceptions that such an outbreak would be worse than SARS, that IV was efficacious in preventing bird-to-human avian influenza transmission were associated with the studied IV behavior (OR=2.64-3.97, p < 0.05). Exposure to live birds, perceived similar symptoms between influenza and bird-to-human H5N1 avian influenza, that bird-to-human avian influenza was more lethal than SARS were predictive use of face mask when having ILI symptoms (OR = 4.25-8.34, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of IV and use of face mask in the study population may be increasing, which may be related to concerns of avian influenza. Perceptions related to human avian influenza were associated with IV and mask use behaviors. This can potentially be turned into opportunities of promoting desirable public health behaviors.

A challenge with this exceptional level of activity and investment is how to select and resource the most promising approaches to have the most significant impact on public health. The WHO Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee (PDVAC) was established in 2014 to provide strategic advice and recommendations to WHO for vaccines in clinical development that could have a significant impact on public health in low and middle income countries. On 7-9th September 2015, PDVAC was convened for the second time, when the committee reviewed vaccine developments in 24 disease areas. This report summarises the key recommendations from that consultation.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, physicians in emergency rooms (ER) of many hospitals have a considerably higher patient load and need to decide within a short time frame whom to hospitalize. Based on our clinical experiences in dealing with COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital Zurich, we created a triage score with the acronym AIFELL consisting of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. The score was then evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 122 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 from March until mid-April 2020. Descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, ANOVA and Scheffe's post hoc analysis confirmed the diagnostic power of the score. The results suggest that the AIFELL score has potential as a triage tool in the ER setting intended to select probable COVID-19 cases for hospitalization in spontaneously presenting or referred patients with acute respiratory symptoms. .

bf2e3fe099d9a30246ebc0e2b131c4f445b36448	Pruritoceptive (dermal) itch was long considered an accompanying symptom of diseases, a side effect of drug applications, or a temporary sensation induced by invading pruritogens, as produced by the stinging nettle. Due to extensive research in recent years, it was possible to provide detailed insights into the mechanism of itch mediation and modulation. Hence, it became apparent that pruritus is a complex symptom or disease in itself, which requires particular attention to improve patients' health. Here, we summarize recent findings in pruritoceptive itch, including how this sensation is triggered and modulated by diverse endogenous and exogenous pruritogens and their receptors. A differentiation between mediating pruritogen and modulating pruritogen seems to be of great advantage to understand and decipher the molecular mechanism of itch perception. Only a comprehensive view on itch sensation will provide a solid basis for targeting this long-neglected adverse sensation accompanying numerous diseases and many drug side effects. Finally, we identify critical aspects of itch perception that require future investigation.

Methods: During the SARS outbreak, a dedicated paramedic surveillance and quarantine program was developed. The authors determined the number of paramedics on quarantine each day, the type of quarantine (either home quarantine [HQ] or work quarantine [WQ]), and the development of SARS-like symptoms. Results: During the SARS outbreak, there were five cases of probable SARS and three cases of suspect SARS. SARS-1 lasted 30 days, during which 234 paramedics were placed on HQ. The total number of HQ days was 1,615. During the five peak days of SARS-1, the total number of HQ days was 664. SARS-2 lasted 18 days, during which 292 paramedics were placed on either HQ or WQ, for a combined number of quarantine days of 1,637. During the five peak days of SARS-2, the combined number of quarantine days was 910. Of these, paramedics were available for duty on 708 days (78%) due to the WQ program. The primary reason for quarantine was unprotected exposure to a health care institution experiencing a SARS outbreak. Under quarantine, SARS-like symptoms developed in 68 paramedics, including cough (53 [78%]), myalgia (33 [48%]), fatigue (30 [44%]), headache (29 [43%]), fever (11 [16%]), and shortness of breath (7 [10%]). Conclusions: Paramedics were among the health care workers who developed SARS. During SARS-2, WQ optimized the number of days on which paramedics were available for duty. Many paramedics developed SARS-like symptoms without being diagnosed as having SARS. A dedicated paramedic surveillance and quarantine program provided a useful means to manage the paramedic resource during the SARS outbreak.
c1ac54b4581083ec171f5504375af631b27ba1bd	Background: The role of two recently identified polyomaviruses, KI and WU, in the causation of respiratory disease has not been established. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of KI and WU viruses (KIV and WUV) in 371 respiratory samples and evaluate their contribution to respiratory disease. Study Design: Specimens were screened for KIV and WUV using single, multiplex or real time PCR; co-infection with other respiratory viruses was evaluated. Results: Of the 371 samples analysed, 10 (2.70%) were positive for KIV and 4 (1.08%) were positive for WUV yielding an overall case prevalence of KIV and WUV infection of 3.77%. KIV and WUV were identified in patients aged <15 years (11 patients) with upper or lower respiratory tract infection and >45 years (3 patients) with upper respiratory tract infection. Co-infections were found in 5 (50%) and 3 (75%) of the KIV and WUV positive samples, respectively. Conclusions: This study supports previous conclusions that KIV and WUV detection in the respiratory tract may be coincidental and reflect reactivation of latent or persistent infection with these viruses. The age distribution of KIV and WUV infection in this study mirrors that found for the other human polyomaviruses, BK and JC.
0ad114139585a123079f9d6658429b37457e6b07	The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Here we show that ACE2 expression on cell lines correlates with susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, suggesting that ACE2 is a major receptor for SARS-CoV. The soluble ectodomain of ACE2 specifically abrogated S-mediated infection and might therefore be exploited for the generation of inhibitors. Deletion of a major portion of the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 had no effect on S-driven infection, indicating that this domain is not important for receptor function. Our results point to a central role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infection and suggest a minor contribution of the cytoplasmic domain to receptor function.
1a5f2c3f99d3607bf9170dcda0c54bc1b4400f6a	threat. Here we investigate 84 pathogens and the host species most at risk for transmission with wild pigs using a network approach. We assess the risk to agricultural and human health by evaluating the status of these pathogens and the co-occurrence of wild pigs, agriculture and humans. We identified 34 (87%) OIE listed swine pathogens that cause clinical disease in livestock, poultry, wildlife, and humans. On average 73% of bacterial, 39% of viral, and 63% of parasitic pathogens caused clinical disease in other species. Non-porcine livestock in the family Bovidae shared the most pathogens with swine (82%). Only 49% of currently listed OIE domestic swine diseases had published wild pig surveillance studies. The co-occurrence of wild pigs and farms increased annually at a rate of 1.2% with as much as 57% of all farms and 77% of all agricultural animals co-occurring with wild pigs. The increasing co-occurrence of wild pigs with livestock and humans along with the large number of pathogens shared is a growing risk for cross-species transmission. Diseases transmitted between humans, wildlife, and domestic animals are increasingly challenging public and veterinary health systems 1, 2 . In North America, it is estimated that at least 79% of reportable domestic animal diseases have a putative wildlife component associated with the transmission, maintenance, or life cycle of the pathogen and at least 40% are zoonotic 3 . Similarly three-fourths of all emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of humans are zoonotic with most originating from wildlife reservoirs 4, 5 . Therefore, diseases that arise from the livestock-wildlife interface are of paramount importance and must be an area of focus for public and veterinary health systems 6 . Despite this importance cross-species transmission is one of the least studied aspects of disease ecology 7, 8 . Wild pigs (Sus scrofa), that include feral domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica), Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa linnaeus), and hybrids between the two, are the most abundant free-ranging, exotic ungulates in North America 9 . Recently, wild pigs in North America have become of increasing concern as a potential veterinary and public health threat for cross-species transmission 9, 10 . Research and policy addressing wild pig disease has received increased attention in recent years 9-11 . This is driven, in part, by substantial range expansion, increasing ecological and agricultural damage, and increased involvement of wild pigs in disease transmission 9 . In North America, wild pigs have expanded their range to at least 41 states in the United States and three provinces in Canada since the 1960s 9, 10, 12 and recent modeling indicates that their potential range may be far greater 13 .

3f50d334193fa8cd216e4c4166e43fb0c8109709	Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), an emerging infectious disease caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has garnered worldwide attention as a consequence of its continuous spread and pandemic potential, making the development of effective vaccines a high priority. We previously demonstrated that residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing potent neutralization antibody responses. In this study, we sought to identify an adjuvant that optimally enhanced the immunogenicity of S377-588 protein fused with Fc of human IgG (S377-588-Fc). Specifically, we compared several commercially available adjuvants, including Freund's adjuvant, aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, Montanide ISA51 and MF59 with regard to their capacity to enhance the immunogenicity of this subunit vaccine. In the absence of adjuvant, S377-588-Fc alone induced readily detectable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses in immunized mice. However, incorporating an adjuvant improved its immunogenicity. Particularly, among the aforementioned adjuvants evaluated, MF59 is the most potent as judged by its superior ability to induce the highest titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, and neutralizing antibodies. The addition of MF59 significantly augmented the immunogenicity of S377-588-Fc to induce strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses as well as protection against MERS-CoV infection in mice, suggesting that MF59 is an optimal adjuvant for MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines.

We conducted cell culture studies and tested serum from pigs exposed to mosquitoes in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana and found no evidence for infection in pigs.
c9b4c7691175724573497c35ff6ac960a3208104	Neonatal sepsis is a disease process, which represents the systemic response of bacteria entering the bloodstream during the first 28 days of life. The prevalence of sepsis is higher in male infants than in females, but the exact cause is unknown. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which leads to the production of NADPH. NADPH is required for the respiratory burst reaction in white blood cells (WBCs) to destroy microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis. Materials and methods. This study was performed on 76 neonates with sepsis and 1214 normal neonates from February 2012 to November 2014 in the west of Iran. The G6PD deficiency status was determined by fluorescent spot test. WBCs number and neutrophils percentages were measured and compared in patients with and without G6PD deficiency. Results. The prevalence of the G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis was significantly higher compared to the control group (p=0.03). WBCs number and neutrophils percentages in G6PD deficient patients compared with patients without G6PD deficiency were decreased, but were not statistically significant (p=0.77 and p=0.86 respectively). Conclusions. G6PD deficiency is a risk factor of neonatal sepsis and also a justification for more male involvement in this disease. Therefore, newborn screening for this disorder is recommended.
13e54d913d0924e4498af2ec5ae8105e1ab5c36a	Recently, a novel verocytotoxin named VT2y was described which belongs to the STx family and is produced by Escherichia coli isolated from domestic poultry with swollen head syndrome (SHS). The VT2y toxin induced apoptosis in Vero, HeLa, CHO, CEF (primary chicken embryo fibroblast) and PCK (primary chicken kidney) cell lines. Morphological evidence (nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation and blebbing of the plasma membrane) of apoptosis could be distinguished in 15 min and was maximal at 1 h after treatment with VT2y. This was confirmed by the terminal dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) method. ß
be055198864c187b2d6fa1ebf62c8363cb3e42ac	A recombinant Fab that recognizes a neutralizing epitope located in the (296 -400) region of protein E of dengue virus was obtained from cloned hybridoma cells secreting the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4E11. The Fd and light chain antibody genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the phagemid vector pMad, expressed in bacteria to produce Fab fragments and sequenced. The mAb 4E11, in particular its light chain complementary-determining regions, shared homologies with two other anti-viral mAbs. The affinity of the parental mAb and the cloned Fab to the MalE-E(296-400) fusion protein were shown to be of the same magnitude, i.e. nanomolar. Fab 4E11 neutralization capacity was found between 8 and 4-times or less lower than that of mAb 4E11, depending on serotypes, thus the Fab could have a smaller antiviral activity than the mAb in vitro.
d114af5d3dcb3792bd9faec1476feba5aaf3617f	A multimodal human-computer interaction system is composed of the comprehensive usage of various input and output channels. For the information input, apart from the traditional keyboard typing, mouse clicking, screen touching, the latest speech and face recognition technology can be used. For the output, the traditional screen display, the latest speech and facial expression synthesis and gesture generation can be used. After literature review of related works, this paper at first presents such a system, MMISE (Multimodal Interaction System for Education), about its architecture and working mechanism, POOOIIM (Pedagogical Objective Oriented Output, Input and Implementation Mechanism) illustrated with practical examples. Then this paper introduces this system's pilot applications in the epidemic time of novel coronavirus in 2020. Keywords: Multimodal human-computer interaction · Intelligent tutoring system · Smart learning environment · Mathematics instruction · Learning of English as a foreign language A multimodal human-computer interaction system "seeks to leverage natural human capabilities to communicate via speech, gesture, touch, facial expression, and other modalities, bringing more sophisticated pattern recognition and classification methods to human-computer interaction" (Turk 2014). With the rapid advance in artificial intelligence in the past decade, including natural language processing, machine learning and pattern recognition, the multimodal human-computer interaction research is leveraging keyboard-tipping, mouse clicking, speech, touch, vision and gestures. A multimodal human-computer interaction system should comprehensively use various input and output channels. For the information input, apart from the traditional keyboard typing, mouse clicking, screen touching, the latest speech and face recognition technology can be utilized. For the information output, the traditional screen display, the latest speech synthesis, facial expression synthesis and gesture generation can be utilized. Two questions arise when a system deals with multiple channels' input and output. The first is how to receive and analyze the multiple input information, and the second is how to generate the appropriate multiple output information.

Methods that enable rapid, sensitive and specific analyses of nucleic acid sequences 2 have positive effects on precise disease diagnostics and effective clinical treatments 3 by providing direct insight into clinically relevant genetic information. Thus far, many 4 CRISPR/Cas systems have been repurposed for diagnostic functions and are 5 revolutionizing the accessibility of robust diagnostic tools due to their high flexibility, 6 sensitivity and specificity. As RNA-guided targeted recognition effectors, Cas9 7 variants have been utilized for a variety of diagnostic applications, including 8 biosensing assays, imaging assays and target enrichment for next-generation 9 sequencing (NGS), thereby enabling the development of flexible and cost-effective 10 tests. In addition, the ensuing discovery of Cas proteins (Cas12 and Cas13) with 11 collateral cleavage activities has facilitated the development of numerous diagnostic 12 tools for rapid and portable detection, and these tools have great potential for 13 point-of-care settings. However, representative reviews proposed on this topic are 14 mainly confined to classical biosensing applications; thus, a comprehensive and 15 systematic description of this fast-developing field is required. In this review, based 16 on the detection principle, we provide a detailed classification and comprehensive 17 discussion of recent works that harness these CRISPR-based diagnostic tools from a 18 new perspective. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of 19 CRISPR-based diagnostics are outlined. 20 sequencing 22 Currently, the most widely used nucleic acid detection methods in clinical 20 practice include quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization 21 (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), which have reshaped the landscape of 22 diagnosis by allowing massive molecular-level information to be used during routine 23 testing. Although considerable improvements have been made over the past several 24 decades, these methods still have limitations. The qPCR methodology is the main 25 force in current clinical laboratories and allow for quantitative and precise disease 26 diagnostics (Arya et al. 2005; Bustin and Mueller 2005). However, the requirement 27 for sophisticated thermal cyclers, specialized expertise and well-established 28 laboratory settings have weakened the generalizability of qPCR, especially in 29 resource-limited areas where the health-care system is usually fragile. FISH analyses 1 offer a single-cell assay that can examine the copy number, amplification, and gene 2 rearrangements that impact targeted therapy implementation (Ettinger et al. 2018; 3 Gradishar et al. 2018); however, the prolonged harsh heat treatment required for FISH 4 probe hybridization makes this tool time-consuming and induces poor cell 5 morphology, which leads to the risk of losing spatial structure information. Moreover, 6 the toxic hazards of formamide used for dsDNA denaturation also pose a significant 7 challenge(Levsky and Singer 2003). NGS has opened the door to large-scale parallel 8 sequencing capabilities, which represents a prominent trend toward personalized 9 medicine based on an individual's genomic data(Blumenthal et al. 2016; van Dijk et al. 10 2014). Nevertheless, NGS is limited by many issues, such as inefficient targeted 11 enrichment, which is responsible for elevated cost and reduced sensitivity(Ballester et 12 al. 2016; Mamanova et al. 2010). In addition, the complex and lengthy procedures 13 associated with this method might prevent its use in applications that require rapid 14 results. Therefore, current approaches have not yet function as a master key for all 15 scenarios, and new technologies are needed for optimized strategies and updated 16 solutions. As newly emerging multifunctional toolboxes, clustered regularly 17 interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems have been harnessed beyond 18 their traditional applications of gene editing. In the past five years, CRISPR systems 19 have been repurposed to enable the development of robust diagnostic tools for 20 detecting nucleic acids due to their intrinsic sensitivity, specificity, flexibility and 21 simplicity. Recent reports employing these CRISPR toolboxes have demonstrated 22 their prospects for redefining methods of detecting nucleic acids, thus demonstrating 23 their similarities to other revolutionary technologies, such as PCR, in their infancy. 24 CRISPR systems function as the adaptive immune systems of bacteria and 25 archaea against invasion elements, such as viruses or plasmids. According to the 26 adaptive immune mechanism, invader-derived short fragments (namely, protospacers) 27 along with their repeat flanking sequences are integrated into the CRISPR arrays to 28 establish genetic memory, and these DNA elements are subsequently transcribed and 29 processed into mature crRNAs that can be assembled with CRISPR-related (Cas) 19 disease-related nucleic acid detection across a range of application fields, including 20 biosensing assays, imaging assays and target enrichment for NGS. We broadly 21 classify these methodologies into two categories based on detection principles: canonical targeted recognition and non-canonical collateral cleavage. We employ this 23 classification because although CRISPR-based diagnostic tools function diversely, 24 their essences are materializations of these two distinct CRISPR fundamentals that 25 lead to different use, performances and features. Therefore, we intend to follow this 26 essential distinction as a clue to discuss the recent advances, current challenges and 27 possible future directions on this topic in a clear and straightforward manner.
2108e5d4607fe0c7f5bb4433899231eb679b65c7	Early detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is key to managing the current global pandemic, as evidence shows the virus is most contagious on or before symptom onset. Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), that enhances sensitivity by aiming to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome rather than targeting particular viral loci, as in typical RT-PCR assays. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. We are able to reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. At higher concentrations, we are able to reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. Such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes/no diagnostic, and can help identify vaccine and drug targets. Finally, we show that POLAR diagnoses on 10 of 10 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples (half positive, half negative) match those obtained in a CLIA-certified lab using the Center for Disease Control's 2019-Novel Coronavirus test. Using POLAR, a single person can process 192 samples over the course of an 8-hour experiment, at a cost of ~$30/patient, enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time included. Further testing and refinement will likely enable greater enhancements in the sensitivity of the above approach.
ba9b440656b250577de64e0459f3af22721ad93d	Background This study aimed to determine the incidence of new onset hepatic steatosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer and its impact on outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy. Methods Retrospective review identified patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and underwent pancreatoduodenectomy from 2013 to 2018. Preoperative computed tomography scans were evaluated for the development of hepatic steatosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Hypoattenuation included liver attenuation greater than or equal to 10 Hounsfield units less than tissue density of spleen on noncontrast computed tomography and greater than or equal to 20 Hounsfield units less on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Results One hundred forty-nine patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for a median of 5 cycles (interquartile range (IQR), 4-6). FOLFIRINOX was the regimen in 78% of patients. Hepatic steatosis developed in 36 (24%) patients. The median time from neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion to pancreatoduodenectomy was 40 days (IQR, 29-51). Preoperative biliary stenting was performed in 126 (86%) patients. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy was delivered to 23 (15%) patients. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged exposure to chemotherapy were identified as risk factors for chemotherapy-associated hepatic steatosis. Compared with control patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy-associated hepatic steatosis, patients developing steatosis had similar rates of postoperative pancreatic fistula (8% (control) vs. 4%, p = 0.3), delayed gastric emptying (8% vs. 14%, p = 0.4), and major morbidity (11% vs. 15%, p = 0.6). Ninety-day mortality was similar between groups (8% vs. 2%, p = 0.08). Conclusion Hepatic steatosis developed in 24% of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy but was not associated with increased morbidity or mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy.

8f677723f22ff19dab033978df0695a4627a812c	Background: Abnormal liver chemistries are common findings in patients with COVID-19. It is unclear whether abnormal liver chemistries can predict the severity of COVID-19. Therefore, we compared the serum liver chemistries such as hepatic transaminases, total bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time to evaluate whether they can predict severity and mortality in COVID-19. . The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each component of liver chemistries. Results: Twenty-two studies were eligible, with 3,256 patients (54.57% males). Seventeen studies compared liver chemistries for severe vs. mild COVID-19, whereas five studies compared liver chemistries in survival vs. non-survival groups. The pooled WMD of AST and ALT in severe vs. mild COVID-19 were 12.23 (95% CI; 8.07, 16.39; p < 0.01) and 8.07 (95% CI 2.55, 11.91; p < 0.01), respectively. The pooled WMD for AST in survivors vs. non-survivors analysis was 8.82 (n = 789; 95% CI; 2.27, 15.37; p < 0.01) and that of ALT was 4.70 (n = 340; 95% CI 0.04,9.35; p = 0.05). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis shows that deranged liver chemistries may indicate severe COVID-19 and could also predict mortality. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between derangement in liver chemistries and mortality in COVID-19.
e3e9414bf0943db76cf84245ece87675d54148ff	Objective: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Wuhan, China. The outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40-day period were retrospectively evaluated. Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style. The primary outcome was restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the secondary outcomes were 30-day survival, and neurological outcome. Results: Data from 136 patients showed 119 (87.5%) patients had a respiratory cause for their cardiac arrest, and 113 (83.1%) were resuscitated in a general ward. The initial rhythm was asystole in 89.7%, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 4.4%, and shockable in 5.9%. Most patients with IHCA were monitored (93.4%) and in most resuscitation (89%) was initiated <1 min. The average length of hospital stay was 7 days and the time from illness onset to hospital admission was 10 days. The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (30.2%), and the most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (75%). Of the patients receiving CPR, ROSC was achieved in 18 (13.2%) patients, 4 (2.9%) patients survived for at least 30 days, and one patient achieved a favourable neurological outcome at 30 days. Cardiac arrest location and initial rhythm were associated with better outcomes. Conclusion: Survival of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who had an in-hospital cardiac arrest was poor in Wuhan. Available online xxx 0300-9572/
82fff12162074c85970f58277accf679cf261344	The accepted gold standard for diagnosing coronavirus disease is the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). However, shortage of reagents has made NPS collection challenging, and alternative samples need to be explored. Due to its non-invasive nature, saliva has considerable diagnostic potential. Therefore, to guide diagnostic laboratories globally, we conducted a systematic review to determine the utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. A systematic search of major databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) was performed to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There was a total of 10 publications that fit the criteria for review. Most studies collected drooled whole saliva from hospitalized patients or pipetted saliva from intubated patients. Saliva was positive in 31-92% of patients depending on the cohort and length of hospitalization. Viral loads in saliva are comparable to those in NPS and ranged from 9.9 × 10 2 to 1.2 × 10 8 copies/mL during the first week of symptoms and decrease over time. Saliva can be positive up to 20 days post-symptom onset with viral loads correlating with symptom severity and degree of tissue damage. Based on these findings, we made suggestions to guide the clinical laboratory and suggest the need for diagnostic accuracy studies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva.
04d3c13a2e5d6e0bf882aa29d6012c882c5954d2	We describe regional variation in the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 infections observed using publicly reported data in the UK, with a view to understanding both if there are clear hot spots in viral spread in the country, or other spatial patterns. Based on case data up to the 9th April, we estimate that the viral replication number remains above 1 overall in the UK but that its trend is to decrease. This suggests the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 patients is imminent. We find that there is significant regional variation in the UK and that this is changing over time. Within England currently the reproductive ratio is lowest in the Midlands (1.11 95% CI 1.07; 1.14  ) , and highest in the North East of England (1.38 95% CI 1.33-1.42). There are long and variable time delays between infection and detection of cases, and thus it remains unclear whether the reduction in the reproductive number is a result of social distancing measures. If we are to prevent further outbreaks, it is critical that we both reduce the time taken for detection and improve our ability to predict the regional spread of outbreaks.
69f2fa711dd9078be28950554564cdd620c618b0	We compared the expressions of class I and class II major histocompatibility antigen complex (MHC) on the surface of Jijoye and P3HR-1 cells of Burkitt's lymphoma sublines. Jijoye cells had a large amount of class I and class II MHC antigens, whereas these antigens were less expressed on P3HR-1 cells. On a subline of P3HR-1 K cells the expression of class I antigen markedly diminished and class II antigen was undetectable. On the other hand, Jijoye, P3HR-1, and P3HR-1 K cell lines were confirmed to be Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nonproducer, low producer, and high producer, respectively. The chemical activation of EBV genome by treating P3HR-1 cells with 12-0-tetradecanyl phorbol-13 acetate (TPA) and n-butyrate resulted in inhibition of the expression of class I and II antigens, while the addition of retinoic acid, an inhibitor of virus replication, blocked the decrease in the MHC antigen expression. These findings suggested that there might be an inverse correlation between the virus production and the expression of class I and II MHC antigens.
b322c2b004bb384ff72b6da2ee511e6b13792bc7	The basic reproduction number is one of the conceptual cornerstones of mathematical epidemiology. Its classical definition as the number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual in a fully susceptible population finds a clear analytical expression in homogeneous and stratified mixing models. Along with the generation time (the interval between primary and secondary cases), the reproduction number allows for the characterization of the dynamics of an epidemic. A clear-cut theoretical picture, however, is hardly found in real data. Here, we infer from highly detailed sociodemographic data two multiplex contact networks representative of a subset of the Italian and Dutch populations. We then simulate an infection transmission process on these networks accounting for the natural history of influenza and calibrated on empirical epidemiological data. We explicitly measure the reproduction number and generation time, recording all individual-level transmission events. We find that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number is untenable in realistic populations, and it does not provide any conceptual understanding of the epidemic evolution. This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due to behavioral changes and other exogenous epidemiological determinants. Rather, it can be simply explained by the (clustered) contact structure of the population. Finally, we provide evidence that methodologies aimed at estimating the instantaneous reproduction number can operationally be used to characterize the correct epidemic dynamics from incidence data. computational modeling | infectious diseases | multiplex networks | reproduction number | generation time The analysis of real epidemiological data has raised issues of the adequacy of the classic homogeneous modeling framework and quantities, such as the basic reproduction number in real-world situations. Based on high-quality sociodemographic data, here we generate a multiplex network describing the contact pattern of the Italian and Dutch populations. By using a microsimulation approach, we show that, for epidemics spreading on realistic contact networks, it is not possible to define a steady exponential growth phase and a basic reproduction number. We show the operational use of the instantaneous reproduction rate as a good descriptor of the transmission dynamics.

b7d2d7eab250d3b70621d8aaf119f4690827d63a	Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an angioproliferative disorder, has a viral etiology and a multifactorial pathogenesis hinged on an immune dysfunction. The disease is multifocal, with a course ranging from indolent, with only skin manifestations to fulminant, with extensive visceral involvement. In the current view, all forms of KS have a common etiology in human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 infection, and the differences among them are due to the involvement of various cofactors. In fact, HHV-8 infection can be considered a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of KS, because further factors (genetic, immunologic, and environmental) are required. The role of cofactors can be attributed to their ability to interact with HHV-8, to affect the immune system, or to act as vasoactive agents. In this contribution, a survey of the current state of knowledge on many and various factors involved in KS pathogenesis is carried out, in particular by highlighting the facts and controversies about the role of some drugs (quinine analogues and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) in the onset of the disease. Based on these assessments, it is possible to hypothesize that the role of cofactors in KS pathogenesis can move toward an effect either favoring or inhibiting the onset of the disease, depending on the presence of other agents modulating the pathogenesis itself, such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, drug intake, or lymph flow disorders. It is possible that the same agents may act as either stimulating or inhibiting cofactors according to the patient's genetic background and variable interactions. Treatment guidelines for each form of KS are outlined, because a unique standard therapy for all of them cannot be considered due to KS heterogeneity. In most cases, therapeutic options, both local and systemic, should be tailored to the patient's peculiar clinical conditions.
22dce3fab7317bb2a8ff48f0da6f2c9717dc6ed9	Astroviruses and kobuviruses are frequently found in mammalian feces, including that of humans. The present study examined fecal samples from 91 Korean dogs suffering from diarrhea. Canine astroviruses (CAstVs) and canine kobuviruses (CKoVs) were identified in 2 (2.1%) and 46 (50.6%) dogs, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis coupled with phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method showed that CAstVs clustered into four genetically diverse groups. Two Korean CAstVs belonged to group 2 alongside strains isolated in Italy and France. Twelve of the Korean CKoVs belonged to a single clade, along with strain UK003 identified in the UK and six CKoVs identified in the USA. Thus, the results suggest that the Korean strain of CAstV is closely related to strains isolated in Europe. Surely, CKoV in South Korea could identify the circulation among dogs population.
cb70928ef1e8112feb2a802c88996237f95a524e	Recombinant proteins are traditionally limited to linear configuration. Herein, we report in vivo protein topology engineering using highly efficient, mechanically interlocking SpyX modules named AXB and BXA. SpyX modules are protein domains composed of p53dim (X), SpyTag (A), and SpyCatcher (B). The p53dim guides the intertwining of the two nascent protein chains followed by autocatalytic isopeptide bond formation between SpyTag and SpyCatcher to fulfill the interlocking, leading to a variety of backbone topologies. Direct expression of AXB or BXA produces protein catenanes with distinct ring sizes. Recombinant proteins containing SpyX modules are obtained either as mechanically interlocked obligate dimers if the protein of interest is fused to the N-or C-terminus of SpyX modules, or as star proteins if the protein is fused to both N-and C-termini. As examples, cellular syntheses of dimers of (GB1) 2 (where GB1 stands for immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G) and of four-arm elastin-like star proteins were demonstrated. Comparison of the catenation efficiencies in different constructs reveals that BXA is generally much more effective than AXB, which is rationalized by the arrangement of three domains in space. Mechanical interlocking induces considerable stability enhancement. Both AXB and BXA have a melting point ∼20°C higher than the linear controls and the BXA catenane has a melting point~2°C higher than the cyclic control BX'A. Notably, four-arm elastin-like star proteins demonstrate remarkable tolerance against trypsin digestion. The SpyX modules provide a convenient and versatile approach to construct unconventional protein topologies via the "assembly-reaction" synergy, which opens a new horizon in protein science for stability enhancement and function reinforcement via topology engineering.
c6f39b4038a5ca389045593a390dd71fc7a5daef	COVID-19 crisis has lasted since the late 2019 to the present day. The severity of the disease is positively correlated with several factors, such as age and coexisting diseases. Furthermore, obesity is increasingly considered as a yet another risk factor, particularly, because it has been observed that people suffering from excessive body weight may experience a more severe course of COVID-19 infection. On the basis of current research, in our nonsystematic review, we have investigated the extent to which obesity can affect the SARS-CoV-2 course and identify the potential mechanisms of the disease. We have also described the role of proper nutrition, physical activity and other aspects relevant to the management of obesity.

54a328a21ff2a09b33c0d6f802ac955731e6a690	Covid-19 is a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given the seriousness of the situation, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic as the Covid-19 rapidly around the world. Among its applications, chest X-ray images are frequently used for an early diagnostic/screening of Covid-19 disease, given the frequent pulmonary impact in the patients, critical issue to prevent further complications caused by this highly infectious disease. In this work, we propose complementary fully automatic approaches for the classification of chest X-ray images under the analysis of 3 different categories: Covid-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. Given the similarity between the pathological impact in the lungs between Covid-19 and pneumonia, mainly during the initial stages of both lung diseases, we performed an exhaustive study of differentiation considering different pathological scenarios. To face these classification tasks, we exploited and adapted to this topic a densely convolutional network architecture, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. To validate the designed approaches, several representative experiments were performed using images retrieved from different public chest X-ray images datasets. Overall, satisfactory results were obtained from the designed experiments, facilitating the doctors' work and allowing better an early diagnostic/screening and treatment of this relevant pandemic pathology.
43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a	Background: Increased vascular permeability is a key feature in the pathophysiology of sepsis and the development of organ failure. Shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx is increasingly being recognized as an important pathophysiological mechanism but at present it is unclear if glypicans contribute to this response. We hypothesized that plasma levels of glypicans (GPC) are elevated in patients with sepsis. Methods: Plasma GPC 1-6 levels were measured by ELISA in 10 patients with sepsis and 10 healthy controls as an initial screening. Plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 were further measured in a cohort of 184 patients with a clinically confirmed infection. Patients were divided into groups of those who had sepsis and those who had an infection without organ failure. To determine whether plasma glypicans could predict the development of organ failure, patients were further subdivided to those who had organ failure at enrolment and those who developed it after enrollment. The association of plasma GPC 1, 3, and 4 with organ failure and with various markers of inflammation, disease severity, and glycocalyx shedding was investigated. Results: In the pilot study, only GPC 1, 3, and 4 were detectable in the plasma of sepsis patients. In the larger cohort, GPC 1, 3, and 4 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in patients with sepsis than in those with infection without organ failure. GPC 1, 3, and 4 were significantly positively correlated with plasma levels of the disease severity markers C-reactive protein, lactate, procalcitonin, and heparin binding protein, and with the marker of glycocalyx degradation syndecan 1. They were significantly negatively correlated with plasma levels of the glycocalyx-protective factors apolipoprotein M and sphingosine-1-phosphate. Conclusions: We show that GPC 1, 3, and 4 are elevated in plasma of patients with sepsis and correlate with markers of disease severity, systemic inflammation, and glycocalyx damage.
6c194890358d91c59efc1e57b8db07a002793a2d	Numerous human studies and animal models have implicated various infectious agents in the pathogenesis of vasculitis in susceptible hosts. However, the link between infection and vasculitis is very complex and only incompletely understood. In fact, different agents can induce the same type of vasculitis, as the case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis exemplifies. Conversely, the same agent can give rise to a panoply of host responses ranging from a clinically silent infection or localized organ involvement to devastating, widespread vasculitis.
8e29fa03ad2ae833e99f41652cc543877d415c44	Infectious diseases still remain one of the biggest challenges for human health. In order to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and develop effective diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents, and preventive vaccines, a suitable animal model which can represent the characteristics of infectious is required. The Syrian hamster immune responses to infectious pathogens are similar to humans and as such, this model is advantageous for studying pathogenesis of infection including post-bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens, along with assessing the efficacy and interactions of medications and vaccines for those pathogens. This review summarizes the current status of Syrian hamster models and their use for understanding the underlying mechanisms of pathogen infection, in addition to their use as a drug discovery platform and provides a strong rationale for the selection of Syrian hamster as animal models in biomedical research. The challenges of using Syrian hamster as an alternative animal model for the research of infectious diseases are also addressed.

Windhager, et al., Second-to-fourth digit ratio and facial shape in Buryats of Southern Siberia, Early Human Development (2020), https://doi. Background. The 2 nd -to-4 th digit ratio (2D:4D) is a putative predictor of a prenatal exposure to sex hormones. 2D:4D is sexually dimorphic (males < females). Studies, linking digit ratio and full facial shapes among Europeans, show that a low 2D:4D is associated with a set of malespecific facial features. Buryats -Mongolian people from Southern Siberiademonstrate a different pattern of facial sexual dimorphism than Europeans (narrower and more vertically elongated faces in men as opposed to women). Aim. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between facial shape and the 2D:4D in comparison to the pattern of facial sexual dimorphism in Buryats. Buryats: 88 men and 80 women aged 20 ± 2 years. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Outcome measures. To assess relationship between facial shape and 2D:4D we used a geometric morphometric approach based on standardized full-face frontal photographs and direct measurements of the digit lengths among right-handed individuals. Results. The results revealed that 2D:4D was associated with facial morphology in Buryat men, and to a lesser extent in women. Narrower faces, elongated in the vertical direction, and a narrower lower facial outline, were characteristic of Buryat men with low 2D:4D ratios, which corresponded to the male-like facial shapes in Buryats. In Europeans, such facial features were reported for men with high 2D:4D, which corresponded to female-like European facial shapes. Hence, our results show that sex-specific morphogenesis in humans is multidirectional, and that digit ratio is capable of predicting sexspecific facial traits even in populations with differing sexually-dimorphic morphology. During the last decades, the 2 nd -to-4 th digits ratio (2D:4D) has been extensively studied as a putative predictor of a prenatal exposure to sex hormonesin humans [1] [2] [3] [4] .Sexual dimorphism of digit ratios is found across a majority of vertebrates starting from amphibians [5,6], although it is not unidirectional in all species [7, 8] . For many human populations,the 2D:4Dhas been reported to be sexually dimorphic (with higher values in women) [9-13],which occursas early as at the 9 th week of gestation [14, 15] . The Leydig cells, which are responsible for production of testosterone (T), start functioning in human male fetusesfrom the 8 th week of gestation [16] , suggesting that an increase in T concentration during early prenatal development can be associated with sexspecific digit morphogenesis. Part of the mechanisms underlying an impact of prenatal androgen/estrogen exposure on the formation of differences in the 2 nd and 4 th digit lengths has Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f already been experimentally revealed in mice [17] . This, along with studies linking the development of digitsand gonads [18], and with androgen receptor sensitivity [19] , suggests 2D:4D to be a fine potential predictor of exposure to sex hormones in utero.The role of the 2D:4D as a marker is also supported by numerous studies reporting its association with sexspecific morphology and behaviour in humans [10, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] (although see [27] [28] [29] for criticism). Human facial morphology is also subjected to considerablesex differences, with menon average having more robust faces:a relatively lower forehead, an (at least slightly) higher facial width-toheight ratio (fWHR), and larger lower face [23, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .One of the reasons for this is also the exposure to gonadal hormones [23, 26, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Surprisingly, researchon the 2D:4D ratioin combination withfacial morphology are very rare. Few comprehensive studies, linkingdigit ratio and full facial shapesamong representatives of European populations [23, 26, 46] , have demonstrated that a low 2D:4D (a typically male trait)shows association with a set of population-specific male facial features, but with an admixture of some other, unrelated to chromosomal sex, patterns [23] .The associationbetween 2D:4D and facial shapewas alsoreported to be especially pronounced in men [23] .Another study, also focusing on a full-facial shape analysis among Europeans, has revealed that male-specific facial traits occur in boys even prior to puberty, and arenegatively associated with the 2D:4D ratio [25]. Sex-specific facial morphology may be subjected to population differences. A number of studies provide evidence that, leastways, such differences occur between Europeanand Asian populations.Primary differencesare located in such facial areas as the lower face, which in Europeans tend to demonstrate higher widths in men, and in Asiansin women [23, 32, 35, [37] [38] [47] [48] , nose, and lip shapes [38, 47, 49] . Therefore, it is ofa special interest to explore whether the association between 2D:4D and facial morphology in different populationscorresponds to the observed variation in facial sexual dimorphism. Udethe capital of Buryatia. All of them (with two exceptions) were students of different specialities (natural and social sciences, engineering, and arts) represented in approximately equal proportions. The body mass index of the participants was within the normal range (men: 22.06 ± 2.66 kg/m 2 ; women: 21.50 ± 2.48 kg/m 2 ; [53, 54] ). (b) Association between facial shape and 2D:4D in men and (c) in women. The average face here is deformed towards ± 5 standard deviations of 2D:4D from that mean. According to the deformation grids displayed in Fig.1b ,low 2D:4D(which presumably indicates a high level of prenatal androgenization) in menwas associated with male-relatedfacial features ( Fig. 1a) , such as a relatively narrower face with larger general height in the vertical plane, a Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f relatively narrower lower face (in the area of the bigonial breadth), and narrower eyesfissures.At the same time high 2D:4D(low prenatal androgenization) in men was associated with some characteristics typical of women in that population.However, not all of the sexspecificmorphometric traitscorresponded to the variation in facial shape explained by the 2D:4D ratio in men. Namely, such parameters are thedistance between the eyes and eyebrows as well as relativeforehead height, which aredistinctive features for menand women, but remained unaffected or demonstrated a reverse patternwhen seen as a function of 2D:4D ratios. Thus, the main differences associated with 2D:4Dare locatedin the mid-and lower part of the male face (in the craniofacial segment), whereas the area of the frontal bone (including forehead and the eyebrow region) did not show differencesin expected direction.In women with higher 2D:4D ratios, the relatively wider spacing of eyebrows and eyes reflect the female pattern, whereas the relatively more massive chin region and lower hairline do not fit the other patterns. The diminutiveness of shape changes even if presented for ±5 SD supports the comparably weak relationship between 2D:4D and facial shape in women. Our study demonstratedthat2D:4D ratio, as a putative proxy for prenatal androgen exposure,isassociated withmale facial morphology, which has also been previously reported forother populations [23, 25, 26, 46] . However, a comparison of our results with the results of thesestudiesshows that the pattern of facial sexual dimorphism, and accordingly the shape pattern of the association with 2D:4D differs between populations.Generally narrower faces, elongated in the vertical direction, and particularly a narrower lower facial outline, were characteristic of men (and boys) of European origin with high 2D:4D ratios. This in turn at least partly corresponded to thefemale-likefacial shapes in thatpopulation (Europeans). At the same time,low 2D:4D ratios in those studies were characteristic of men with relatively wider faces(especially in Journal Pre-proof Psychoneuroendocrinology 32(4) (2007) 313-321. https://doi.org/1016/j.psyneuen.2007.01.007.

4b235b3bef6fee012067ccb7069d492d7449211d	Abnormal coagulation parameters and potential benefits of anticoagulant therapy in general population with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) have been reported. However, limited data are available on cancer patients. Coagulation indexes and inflammation parameters in 57 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with different severity were retrospectively analyzed. We found that D-dimer levels were increased in 33 patients (57.9%, median: 790 ng/mL). Compared with ordinary type patients, severe and critical ill patients had decreased MPV values (P = 0.006), prolonged PT (median: 13.3 vs. 11.5 vs. 11.4 s, P < 0.001), significant higher D-dimer levels (median: 2,400 vs. 940 vs. 280 ng/mL, P < 0.001), higher PCT levels (median: 0.17 vs. 0.055 vs. 0.045 ng/mL, P = 0.002), higher IL-6 (median: 20.6 vs. 2.3 vs. 3.0 pg/mL, P = 0.040), and decreased PaO 2 (median: 68 vs. 84 vs. 96 mm Hg, P < 0.001). Importantly, three patients, one severe and two critical ill type, with increased D-dimer survived after anticoagulant therapy with continuous heparin infusion. Increased D-dimer levels positively correlated with increased PCT levels (r = 0.456, P = 0.002) and IL-6 levels (r = 0.501, P = 0.045). A negative correlation between D-dimer levels and PaO 2 levels (r = −0.654, P = 0.021) were also existed. Cancer patients with COVID-19 showed prominent hypercoagulability associated with severe inflammation, anticoagulation therapy might be useful to improve the prognosis and should be immediately used after the onset of hypercoagulability.

Such metapopulation models describe disease spread on a number of spatial patches. In the first model considered, there is no explicit movement of individuals; rather infectives can pass the disease to susceptibles in other patches. The second type of model explicitly includes rates of travel between patches and also takes account of the resident patch as well as the current patch of individuals. A formula for and useful bounds on the basic reproduction number of the system are determined. Brief descriptions of application of this type of metapopulation model are given to investigate the spread of bovine tuberculosis and the effect of quarantine on the spread of influenza.
4329f632461790f1c80ef2cc8d2298a3b5d9dffe	The ability of spermatogenic cells to evade the host immune system and the ability of systemic inflammation to inhibit male reproductive function represent two of the most intriguing conundrums of male reproduction. Clearly, an understanding of the underlying immunology of the male reproductive tract is crucial to resolving these superficially incompatible observations. One important consideration must be the very different immunological environments of the testis, where sperm develop, and the epididymis, where sperm mature and are stored. Compared with the elaborate blood-testis barrier, the tight junctions of the epididymis are much less effective. Unlike the seminiferous epithelium, immune cells are commonly observed within the epithelium, and can even be found within the lumen, of the epididymis. Crucially, there is little evidence for extended allograft survival (immune privilege) in the epididymis, as it exists in the testis, and the epididymis is much more susceptible to loss of immune tolerance. Moreover, the incidence of epididymitis is considerably greater than that of orchitis in humans, and susceptibility to sperm antibody formation after damage to the epididymis or vas deferens increases with increasing distance of the damage from the testis. Although we still know relatively little about testicular immunity, we know less about the interactions between the epididymis and the immune system. Given that the epididymis appears to be more susceptible to inflammation and immune reactions than the testis, and thereby represents the weaker link in protecting developing sperm from the immune system, it is probably time this imbalance in knowledge was addressed.

Its ability to dismantle the prevailing positivist understanding of the interaction between legal orders and to stand out from the overwhelming and often repetitive literature on the philosophy of EU law should be praised. What is especially noteworthy is the idea of "corrective justice." This notion explains very well the adoption of financial assistance measures as expression of a new form of solidarity, based on the notion of fair redress for a committed wrong, namely the structural deficiencies detectable in the design of the eurozone.

The COVID-19 outbreak is a sharp reminder that pandemics, like other rarely occurring catastrophes, have happened in the past and will continue to happen in the future. Even if we cannot prevent dangerous viruses from emerging, we should prepare to dampen their effects on society. The current outbreak has had severe economic consequences across the globe, and it does not look like any country will be unaffected. This not only has consequences for the economy; all of society is affected, which has led to dramatic changes in how businesses act and consumers behave. This special issue is a global effort to address some of the pandemic-related issues affecting society. In total, there are 12 papers that cover different industry sectors (e.g., tourism, retail, higher education), changes in consumer behavior and businesses, ethical issues, and aspects related to employees and leadership. actively engage with their corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies and agenda. The post-COVID-19 marketplace is going to be irrecoverably different. Organizations will need to reevaluate their visions, missions, and objectives to account for changes to their customers and competitors, amongst other shifts. A key facet of this is the exponential increase in digital communications and change. Professors T. Y. Leung, Piyush Sharma, Pattarin Adithipyangkul, and Peter Hosie wrote "Gender Diversity and Public Health Outcomes: The COVID-19 Experience." Public health is an interdisciplinary subject that involves the social sciences, public policy, public education, economics, and management. Failure to implement a proper public health policy may not only lead to a huge loss of human lives but also shatter the economy; expose the incompetence of public bodies, including governments and political leaders; and weaken the confidence of the general public. We are used to hearing that women are more other-directed and emotionally intelligent, but it has been proven that women are just as good, if not better, in terms of what we think of as male qualities, like being decisive and making tough calls, during a crisis. Prevalent issues like under-representation of women in leadership positions, mismanagement of public health systems, and inaccurate or inconsistent reporting of public health outcomes in the context of the recent pandemic need to be addressed by involving women at all stages of public health management, including planning, decision-making, and emergency response systems. This is important not only for a quick economic recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis but also to prevent and manage such disasters in future.

These big data can be easily generated and collected from a wide variety of data sources. A data science frameworksuch as predictive analytics framework-helps mining data from various big data sources to find useful information and discover knowledge, which can then be transformed into wisdom for appropriate actions. In this paper, we present an innovative big data predictive analytics framework over hybrid big data sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our framework, we conduct several case studies, including one on applying the framework to disease analytics. More specifically, we integrate, incorporate and analyze weather data and web-search data to predict and forecast dengue cases based on a hybrid of three kernels in support vector machine (SVM) ensemble. Results show how our predictive analytics framework benefits health agencies in disease control and prevention.
dcc32065f9d6be3caad05483787cfafbbfbb7a7e	High Performance Computing (HPC) systems are facing severe limitations in both power and memory bandwidth/capacity. By now, these limitations have been addressed individually: to improve performance under a strict power constraint, power capping, which sets power limits to components/nodes/jobs, is an indispensable feature; and for memory bandwidth/capacity increase, the industry has begun to support hybrid main memory designs that comprise multiple different technologies including emerging memories (e.g., 3D stacked DRAM or Non-Volatile RAM) in one compute node. However, few works look at the combination of both trends. This paper explicitly targets power managements on hybrid memory based HPC systems and is based on the following observation: in spite of the system software's efforts to optimize data allocations on such a system, the effective memory bandwidth can decrease considerably when we scale the problem size of applications. As a result, the performance bottleneck component changes in accordance with the footprint (or data) size, which then also changes the optimal power cap settings in a node. Motivated by this observation, we propose a power management concept called footprint-aware power capping (FPCAP) and a profile-driven software framework to realize it. Our experimental result on a real system using HPC benchmarks shows that our approach is successful in correctly setting power caps depending on the footprint size while keeping around 93/96% of performance/power-efficiency compared to the best settings.
d36c176175904edc6271bdcc461af2fc172c9f3a	Many types of thermometers have been developed to measure body temperature. Infrared thermometers (IRT) are fast, convenient and ease to use. Two types of infrared thermometers are uses to measure body temperature: tympanic and forehead. With the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus, forehead temperature measurement is used widely to screen people for the illness. The performance of this type of device and the criteria for screening are worth studying. This study evaluated the performance of two types of tympanic infrared thermometers and an industrial infrared thermometer. The results showed that these infrared thermometers provide good precision. A fixed offset between tympanic and forehead temperature were found. The measurement values for wrist temperature show significant offsets with the tympanic temperature and cannot be used to screen fevers. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for the measurement of body temperature using an infrared thermometer was proposed. The suggestion threshold for the forehead temperature is 36 • C for screening of fever. The body temperature of a person who is possibly ill is then measured using a tympanic infrared thermometer for the purpose of a double check. Sensors 2020, 20, 2885 2 of 17 the measured temperature is displayed on the IRT. This principle is used to develop an IRT to measure body temperature [4] [5] [6] [7] .

IRT is a rapid detection method and the most commonly used IRTs measure the temperature of the tympanic and the forehead. The tympanic is close to the core temperature of the body and gives the most accurate representation of the body temperature [4,6-10]. The screening of passengers for signs of Ebola infection was observed with a noncontact thermometer at five airports in USA in 2014 [11] . IRTs are used to measure the tympanic or forehead temperatures. The probe cover must be changed, and the probe must be adjusted to fit the shape of the ear canal, so measuring the tympanic temperature is a troublesome process. A forehead IRT is convenient and noninvasive, so any risk of mutual infection is prevented, and as such, public places, such as airports, schools, hospital, and transportation vehicles, used this type of device to screen the public in the SARS era [12] [13] [14] . This method is also currently used to prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) . However, noncontact IRTs are not proven in terms of accuracy, so it is necessary to determine whether an IRT gives as reliable information as other thermometers. The performance of forehead thermometers has been questioned [15] . Hsiao et al. [16] suggested taking temperature measurements twice for people before entering the hospital to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread. The surface emissivity of an object has the most significant effect on the temperature that is measured by an IRT. The emissivity of the tympanic membrane is assumed to be 1.0, but the emissivity of human skin is between 0.976 and 0.984 [17] [18] [19] [20] . There are two types of infrared techniques available for the surface temperature detection. One is the point estimation to detect the tympanic temperature or the forehead temperature, and the device is called tympanic IRT or forehead IRT. The other is the IR thermography or thermal imaging. The thermal detector is used to detect the receive radiation from the targets. The sensing elements of thermal detectors are the pyroelectric detector and the thermopile for infrared thermometers and the bolometer focal plane arrays (Bolometer FDA) for IR thermography. Recently, research on the application of infrared thermography on human body temperature measurement has been carried out. Sharma and Yadav [21] proposed a noncontact temperature algorithm for face detection in a video sequence and validated its performance against standard temperature device. proposed a novel method to segment the forehead region of the human beings and to calculate the mean temperature of these area. With this simple and accurate method, the thermal face images in different features are presented. Chaglla et al. [23] introduced an ear-based device to measure the ear temperature continuously. The novel design involved coating graphene platelets on the lens of an infrared thermopile sensor, and the performance of this device was validated by comparing it with others commercial ear thermometers. Tay et al. [24] evaluated three types of infrared thermal detection systems for fever screening in tropical conditions and found that the devices with video monitoring had very high specificity and the handheld thermograph could not be used for fever screening. Many factors affect the temperature measurement of the human body [25, 26] . Erickson and Kirklin [27] performed invasive measurements using pulmonary artery temperature as an indicator to compare tympanic, bladder, oral and axillary temperature. The difference between the pulmonary artery temperature and the ear temperature was 0.07 • C ± 0.41 • C, for the bladder temperature, the value was 0.03 • C ± 0.23 • C, for the oral temperature, the value was 0.05 • C ± 0.26 • C and for the axillary temperature, the value was −0.68 • C ± 0.57 • C. These results show that the bladder temperature and the mouth temperature are closest to the pulmonary artery temperature, followed by the tympanic temperature, and the value for the axillary temperature was low. Patel et al. [28] compared the correlation between esophageal temperature, tympanic temperature and forehead surface temperature. The difference between the temperature of the esophagus and the frontal temperature was −1.64 • C to 2.32 • C, for the ear temperature, the difference was −1.02 • C to
c1ff49fbde89cf3e33a0e7d90e7f3692f60db71d	Objectives. Host immune responses are indispensable to combat the disease. We report the dynamics of peripheral immune cells, cytokines, and human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) and its receptor expressions in a patient suffering from critical COVID-19 pneumonia to convalescence. Methods. Clinical data of the patient were collected from medical records. The expressions of HLA-G and receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 in peripheral immune cells were measured with flow cytometry. Results. From critical COVID-19 to the convalescent stage, early lymphopenia was improved (median: 0.6 9 10 9 L À1 vs. 0.9 9 10 9 L À1 , P = 0.009), and an obvious fluctuation in WBC and neutrophil counts was observed. Initially, low levels of CD4 + T cells (from 120 to 528 lL À1 ) and CD8 + T cells (from 68 to 362 lL À1 ) gradually increased to normal levels. Meanwhile, high IL-6 (from 251.8 to 6.32 pg mL À1 ), IL-10 (from 39.53 to 5.21 pg mL À1 ) and IFN-c (from 13.55 to 3.16 pg mL À1 ) levels decreased, and IL-4 (from 2.36 to 3.19 pg mL À1 ) and TNF-a (from 2.27 to 20.2 pg mL À1 ) levels increased quickly when the viral RNA returned negative. Moreover, the percentage of HLA-G + T cells, B cells and monocytes follows high-low-high pattern, while the percentage of receptors ILT2-, ILT4-and KIR2DL4-expressing cells remained relatively stable. Conclusion. Our findings provide valuable information on the dynamics of early peripheral immunological responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, cytokines and HLA-G + immune cells are associated with the natural history of the critical COVID-19 patient; however, future studies are necessary.
5ab454ee5185aade40b2bc051a2fea8d145ec9cb	The entire world is now eventually locked down due to the outbreak of nCOVID-19 corona virus outbreak. The fast and relentless spread nCOVID-19 has basically segmented the populace only into merely into three classes, such as susceptible, infected and recovered compartments. Adapting the classical SEIR-type epidemic modelling framework, the direct person-to-person contact transmission is taken as the direct route of transmission of nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this research, the authors have developed a model of the nation-wide trends of the outburst of the nCOVID-19 infection using an SEIR Model. The SEIR dynamics are expressed using ordinary differential equations. is withdrawn on 14th April 2020, as a whole, then from the simulation, the authors have predicted that the infected population will flare-up to a large extent , suddenly, however, gradual or zone specific withdrawal would be more effective solution. This study also suggested some possible way-out to get rid of this situation by providing a trade-off between ' flattening of the curve" as well as " less economic turbulence. The projections are intended to provide a base/ action plan for the socio-economic counter measures to alleviate nCOVID-19.
570862c4784b6f780726ec0548fc402a413146b4	Inhibition of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation may represent a mechanism for cardiac protection against ischemia. Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is highly expressed in response to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and induces activation of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. We targeted EMMPRIN with paramagnetic/fluorescent micellar nanoparticles conjugated with the EMMPRIN binding peptide AP-9 (NAP9), or an AP-9 scrambled peptide as a negative control (NAPSC). We found that NAP9 binds to endogenous EMMPRIN in cultured HL1 myocytes and in mouse hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (IR). Injection of NAP9 at the time of or one day after IR, was enough to reduce progression of myocardial cell death when compared to Control and NAPSC injected mice (infarct size in NAP9 injected mice: 32%±6.59 vs Control: 46%±9.04 or NAPSC injected mice: 48%±7.64). In the same way, cardiac parameters were recovered to almost healthy levels (LVEF NAP9 63% ± 7.24 vs Control 42% ± 4.74 or NAPSC 39% ± 6.44), whereas ECM degradation was also reduced as shown by inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans have shown a signal enhancement in the left ventricle of NAP9 injected mice with respect to non-injected, and to mice injected with NAPSC. A positive correlation between CMR enhancement and Evans-Blue/TTC staining of infarct size was calculated (R:0.65). Taken together, these results point to EMMPRIN targeted nanoparticles as a new approach to the mitigation of ischemic/reperfusion injury.
a62764b7bba0efd7727d498cac102f991ddf4475	Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been recognized as an invariant internal control for various gene expression studies due to its classical housekeeping role in the glycolytic metabolism. However recently, this enzyme has been proven to be a multifunctional protein involved in diverse non-glycolytic activities. In the present study, two paralogue isoforms of GAPDH mRNAs were characterized from a marine teleost species, rockbream (Oplegnathus fasciatus; Perciformes) and their transcriptional responses to bacterial and viral infections were examined. Rockbream GAPDH1 and GAPDH2 cDNAs encoded 333 and 335 amino acids, respectively, and the amino acid sequence identity between those two isoforms was 74%. Two isoform GAPDH mRNAs were detected ubiquitously in all of tissues examined, but their expression levels were quite variable among tissues. Based on the real-time RT-PCR analysis, the transcription of rbGAPDH1 was affected by neither bacterial (Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio anguillarum or Streptococcus iniae) nor viral (rockbream iridovirus; RBIV) challenges. However on the contrary, the mRNA expression of rbGAPDH2 was significantly up-regulated in liver resulting from the bacterial infections (up to 25-fold), and in both liver (more than sixfold) and kidney (up to fivefold) from the viral infection. Results in the present study suggest that teleost GAPDH isoforms may also be potentially involved in immune modulations especially with respect to inflammatory responses, which is distinct from its classical glycolytic function.
b43dfe0a56d2cdfde6099e31f5602459c7c1a4df	In 2012, China's urbanization rate reached 52.57 % but, if we counted only people with urban hukou s, this was only 35.29 %; there were 263 million migrant workers in China, 1 where they have already been playing a leading role in urbanization. Nonetheless, governments are still managing applications for new permanent urban residents' registration, demanded by rural migrant workers, by using the longestablished hukou -based public service policies. This has constituted a big obstacle to the citizenization of rural migrant workers in China, caused a great deal of problems with urban management, and is contrary to social justice. In 2013, it was made clear in the Report on the Work of the Government that relevant authorities should accelerate reform of the household registration system and related institutions; that they should register eligible rural workers as permanent urban residents in an orderly manner, "progressively expand the coverage of basic public services in urban areas to include all their permanent residents and create an equitable institutional environment for freedom of movement and for people to live and work in contentment." 2 Accordingly, in order to protect the rights of migrants and improve the quality of the process of social urbanization in China, the most signifi cant tasks involve investigating the current status of basic public services in Chinese towns and cities, especially the public services provided for potential new permanent migrant worker

Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the U.S. healthcare landscape. Within psychiatry, a sudden relaxing of insurance and regulatory barriers during the month of March 2020 enabled clinicians practicing in a wide range of settings to quickly adopt virtual care in order to provide critical ongoing mental health supports to both existing and new patients struggling with the pandemic's impact. In this article, we briefly review the extensive literature supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry relative to in-person mental health care, and describe how payment and regulatory challenges were the primary barriers preventing more widespread adoption of this treatment modality prior to COVID-19. We then review key changes that were implemented at the federal, state, professional, and insurance levels over a one-month period that helped usher in an unprecedented transformation in psychiatric care delivery, from mostly in-person to mostly virtual. Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers. Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future.
16cc0c9b0ff0c921df43dae98f9f9bc36af518a7	The purpose of this study is to understand institutional effects on digital platform development and use for national health insurance in a developing country. Information systems research on digital platforms for the health sector has focused more on healthcare. Less research exists on health insurance. This study, therefore, addresses the research gap by focusing on digital platform for national health insurance service in a developing country. The study employs qualitative, interpretive case study as methodology and institutional theory as analytical lens to investigate regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive institutional effects on digital platform development and use for national health insurance in Ghana. The findings show the institutional enablers as: (1) healthseeking culture; (2) mobile network penetration and use; and (3) appropriate laws and regulations. Conversely, the constraints are (1) Unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) functionality; and (2) extended family system.
e704299cf656743be4a8943612c55bb3f437d467	Objectives: It is unclear whether patients with hypertension are more likely to be infected with SARS-COV-2 than the general population and whether there is a difference in the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients who have taken ACEI/ARB drugs to lower blood pressure compared to those who have not. Methods: This observational study included data from all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China between January 5 and March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was cutoff on March 8, 2020. Results: A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertension. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive COVID-19 PCR detection rates. Patients with hypertension who had previously taken ACEI/ARB drugs for antihypertensive treatment have an increased tendency to develop severe pneumonia after infection with SARS-COV-2 (P = 0.064). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly older and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.

15726ede2df1455a140f54dd59326134626623a5	Human trichinellosis is acquired by eating raw or undercooked meats carrying muscle larvae of Trichinella spp. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential components of the innate immune system. However, little is known about the potential application of TLR agonists for immunotherapy against Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis) infection. Here, we evaluated the effects of four TLR agonists (i.e., TLR3, TLR4, TLR8, and TLR9 agonists) on T. spiralis infection in mice. The reduction rate of worm burden showed that TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) significantly reduced T. spiralis infection rather than TLR4, TLR8, and TLR9 agonists (p < 0.05). Moreover, TLR3 showed a continuous high-level of expression during 6-35 days post infection (dpi). The levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-6 increased significantly in mice serum compared with control group after treatment with TLR3 agonist at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 28, and 35 dpi (p < 0.05). A significant decreasing trend was also detected in levels of IL-10 and IL-4 after treatment with TLR3 agonist compared with control group at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 28, and 35 dpi (p < 0.05). Overall, this study suggested that TLR3-targeted therapies might be effective on worm burden reduction by regulation of the cytokine levels in the mice infected with T. spiralis.
7f1f94a49e088244c897fd0bfc96de817d1b804a	A distinct conformational transition from the α-helix-rich cellular prion protein (PrP C ) into its β-sheet-rich pathological isoform (PrP Sc ) is the hallmark of prion diseases, a group of fatal transmissible encephalopathies that includes spontaneous and acquired forms. Recently, a PrP Sc -like intermediate form characterized by the formation of insoluble aggregates and protease-resistant PrP species termed insoluble PrP C (iPrP C ) has been identified in uninfected mammalian brains and cultured neuronal cells, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of these diseases. Here, we explore the molecular characteristics of the spontaneously formed iPrP C in cultured neuroblastoma cells expressing wild-type or mutant human PrP linked to two familial prion diseases. We observed that although PrP mutation at either residue 183 from Thr to Ala (PrP T183A ) or at residue 198 from Phe to Ser (PrP F198S ) affects glycosylation at both N-linked glycosylation sites, the T183A mutation that results in intracellular retention significantly increased the formation of iPrP C . Moreover, while autophagy is increased in F198S cells, it was significantly decreased in T183A cells. Our results indicate that iPrP C may be formed more readily in an intracellular compartment and that a significant increase in PrP T183A aggregation may be attributable to the inhibition of autophagy.
3e7fb377a3e6358469d814910f015cbc631e92d0	Introduction: Musculoskeletal conditions are a leading cause of global morbidity. Access to traditional in-person healthcare can be difficult for some under usual conditions and has become a ubiquitous barrier throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth, defined as the 'delivery of healthcare at a distance using information and communication technology' is a solution to many access barriers and has been rapidly adopted by many healthcare professions throughout the crisis. While significant advancements in technology has made the widespread adoption of telehealth feasible, there are many factors to be considered when implementing a telehealth service. Purpose: The aims of this masterclass are to (i) introduce telehealth and outline the current research within the context of musculoskeletal physiotherapy; (ii) provide insights into some of the broader challenges in the wide-scale adoption of telehealth; and (iii) to describe a systematic approach to implementing telehealth into existing healthcare settings, along with some practical considerations. Implications: Telehealth is a broad concept and should be implemented to meet the specific needs of a healthcare service. This masterclass offers a structured approach to the implementation of a musculoskeletal physiotherapy telehealth service, and highlights practical considerations required by both clinicians and healthcare organisations throughout all stages of the implementation process.
c34009382107e245ff56d697a67d8c6b0d4642c4	The recent pandemic of CoVID-19 has emerged as a threat to global health security. There are a very few prognostic models on CoVID-19 using machine learning.
d1f71054fc7c1bb79d5d1d9c298e6c691749a688	We developed a computational approach called Domain-architecture Aware Inference of Orthologs (DAIO) for the analysis of protein orthology by combining phylogenetic and protein domain-architecture information. Using DAIO, we performed a systematic study of the proteomes of all human Herpesviridae species to define Strict Ortholog Groups (SOGs). In addition to assessing the taxonomic distribution for each protein based on sequence similarity, we performed a protein domain-architecture analysis for every protein family and computationally inferred gene duplication events. While many herpesvirus proteins have evolved without any detectable gene duplications or domain rearrangements, numerous herpesvirus protein families do exhibit complex evolutionary histories. Some proteins acquired additional domains (e.g., DNA polymerase), whereas others show a combination of domain acquisition and gene duplication (e.g., betaherpesvirus US22 family), with possible functional implications. This novel classification system of SOGs for human Herpesviridae proteins is available through the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR, www.viprbrc.org).
8968dc85659af07a6c563c9860f867b2b4800def	COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges globally. Countries have adopted different strategies with varying degrees of success. Epidemiologists are studying the impact of government actions using scenario analysis. However, the interactions between the government policy and the disease dynamics are not formally captured. We, for the first time, formally study the interaction between the disease dynamics, which is modelled as a physical process, and the government policy, which is modelled as the adjoining controller. Our approach enables compositionality, where either the plant or the controller could be replaced by an alternative model. Our work is inspired by the engineering approach for the design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Consequently, we term the new framework Compositional Cyber-Physical Epidemiology (CCPE). We created different classes of controllers and applied these to control the disease in New Zealand and Italy. Our controllers closely follow government decisions based on their published data. We not only reproduce the pandemic progression faithfully in New Zealand and Italy but also show the tradeoffs produced by differing control actions.
06f438eb0076630b62b2b9a5162d5865540698a3	We reviewed Greek law (legislation, historic Royal Decrees, and modern Presidential ones, 1833-2010) pertinent to control of communicable diseases and compared this body of Greek law with the revised International Health Regulations. Greece authorizes and regulates communicable disease control commensurate with public health risks, and integrates the principles of equality, objectivity, and respect for human rights. Despite strength at the level of principles, Greek law lacks coherence, clarity, and systematization. An inadequate body of regulations means legislation falls short of adequate implementing authority and guidelines; public health authorities often cannot find or understand the laws, nor are they certain about allocation of jurisdictional authority. We identified areas for improvement.
624ae1b065cb383d72e51cbdcedcfe8a6d31c54d	Since the initial outbreak in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 , has rapidly spread to cause one of the most pressing challenges facing our world today: the COVID-19 pandemic. Within four months of the first reported cases, more than two and a half million cases were confirmed with over two hundred thousand deaths globally, and many countries had taken extreme measures to stop the spread. In this work, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 103 countries over the period 22 January to 13 April 2020. We utilise a novel stochastic epidemiological model that includes a regulatory mechanism that captures the level of tolerance to rising confirmed cases within the response behaviour. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we identify that the top ten outbreaks as of 31 March are characterised by a high tolerance to rising cases tallies, whereas countries that avoided severe outbreak have a low tolerance. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher identification rate. As of 13 April, almost all countries show declines in transmission rates and basic reproductive numbers. Furthermore, countries approaching recovery also increased their identification rate between 31 March and 13 April. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in undocumented infections dramatically impacts uncertainty in predictions. Overall, we recommend that broader testing is required to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections.

517e4d60093973663e37dba2969be6d7e76fbd30	The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the key protein for the formation of the helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly. This protein is believed to be more conserved than other proteins of the virus, such as spike and membrane glycoprotein. In this study, the N protein of SARS-CoV was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5a and identified with pooled sera from patients in the convalescence phase of SARS. A plasmid pCI-N, encoding the full-length N gene of SARS-CoV, was constructed. Expression of the N protein was observed in COS1 cells following transfection with pCI-N. The immune responses induced by intramuscular immunization with pCI-N were evaluated in a murine model. Serum anti-N immunoglobulins and splenocytes proliferative responses against N protein were observed in immunized BALB/c mice. The major immunoglobulin G subclass recognizing N protein was immunoglobulin G2a, and stimulated splenocytes secreted high levels of gamma interferon and IL-2 in response to N protein. More importantly, the immunized mice produced strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and CD8 + CTL responses to N protein. The study shows that N protein of SARS-CoV not only is an important B cell immunogen, but also can elicit broad-based cellular immune responses. The results indicate that the N protein may be of potential value in vaccine development for specific prophylaxis and treatment against SARS.
684ce2d88abc448c6083962ab2d58169c80e344d	The developmental sequence of a neurotropic strain (JHM) of mouse hepatitis virus was examined by transmission electron microscopy and immunocytology. The nucleoprotein core of this coronavirus, which contains RNA of positive polarity and is helical in configuration, becomes incorporated into enveloped particles in the same manner as the nucleocapsids of the orthomyxo-and paramyxoviruses. However, JHM virus is assembled intracellularly by budding at surfaces of smooth membranous vacuoles. A comparison of JHM virus replication in L2 and 17C1-1 cell lines revealed that L2 cells undergo more rapid cytopathology and cease virus production much sooner than 17CI-I cells. In L2 cells the accumulation of core material appears to continue after the abrupt cessation of virus assembly. This is evident by the massive cytoplasmic accumulation of structures resembling nucleocapsids, which react with hybridoma antibody to the nucleocapsid antigen as demonstrated by the immunoperoxidase procedure. The current findings are consistent with our previously published demonstration, using cells of neural and other deviation, of the fundamental role of the host cell type in regulat ing the replication and expression of coronaviruses. Coronaviruses have been characterized as a separate group [1] predominantly based on
a545e4e85d52c1aa0eaea99a9c1ce04fbbcd38eb	Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) has attracted increasing attention as a possible environmental disease, and a significant mount of research from complementary scientific fields has been dedicated to its etiology. There are two actual competing theories attempting to explain the cause of this kidney disease: 1) the mycotoxin hypothesis, which considers that BEN is produced by ochratoxin A ingested intermittently in small amounts by the indivriduals in the endemic regions, and 2) the Pliocene lignite hypothesis, which proposes that the disease is caused by long-term exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other toxic organic compounds leaching into the well drinking water from low rank coals underlying or proximal to the enidemic settdements. We outline the current developments and future prospects in the study of BEN and differentiate possible factors and cofactors in disease etiology. Key workr. aromatic compounds,

Infection control measures have played a major role in limiting human/camel-to-human transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); however, development of effective and safe human or camel vaccines is warranted. Methods. We extended and optimized our previous recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5)-based vaccine platform characterized by in vivo amplified and CD40-mediated specific responses to generate MERS-CoV S1 subunit-based vaccine. We generated rAd5 constructs expressing CD40-targeted S1 fusion protein (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L), untargeted S1 (rAd5-S1), and Green Fluorescent Protein (rAd5-GFP), and evaluated their efficacy and safety in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 transgenic (hDPP4 Tg + ) mice. Results. Immunization of hDPP4 Tg + mice with a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L elicited as robust and significant specific immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies as those induced with 2 doses of rAd5-S1. After MERS-CoV challenge, both vaccines conferred complete protection against morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by significantly undetectable/reduced pulmonary viral loads compared to the control group. However, rAd5-S1-but not rAd5-S1/F/CD40L-immunized mice exhibited marked pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage post-MERS-CoV challenge despite the observed protection. Conclusions. Incorporation of CD40L into rAd5-based MERS-CoV S1 vaccine targeting molecule and molecular adjuvants not only enhances immunogenicity and efficacy but also prevents inadvertent pulmonary pathology after viral challenge, thereby offering a promising strategy to enhance safety and potency of vaccines.
2337891ac00776800e86643b9efefd63c835c86a	Recent events surrounding emerging infectious diseases, bioterrorism and increasing multidrug antibiotic resistance in bacteria have drastically increased current needs for effective vaccines. Many years of study have shown that live, attenuated pathogens are often more effective at delivering heterologous protein or DNA to induce protective immune responses. However, these vaccine carriers have inherent safety concerns that have limited their development and their use in many patient populations. Studies using nonliving delivery mechanisms have shown that providing both protein antigen and DNA encoding the antigen to an individual induces an improved, more protective immune response but rarely, if ever, are both delivered simultaneously. Here, non-replicating bacterial minicells derived from a commensal E. coli strain are shown to effectively induce antigen-specific immune responses after simultaneous protein and DNA delivery. These data demonstrate the potential use of achromosomal bacterial minicells as a vaccine carrier.

The 30 development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-31 CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based 32 on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These 33 methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample 34 throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly 35 quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This 36 in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, 37 regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA 38 assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. 39 determine TCID 50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC 50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. 40 Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and 41 inhibition and may facilitate future research. 42 43 44 2 Introduction: 45 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a novel human pathogen 46 at the end of 2019 and spread around the globe within three months. It causes the coronavirus disease 2019 47 (COVID-19) that if symptomatic manifests as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and can progress to 48 pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting in septic shock, multi-organ failure and death. As 49 of end of May 2020, more than 376,000 deaths worldwide occurred upon SARS-CoV-2 infection which 50 forced governments to implement strict measures of social distancing to limit the spread of the virus but 51 greatly impacted individual freedom and economy. Due to its high transmissibility, without such harsh 52 interventions its pandemic spread is unlikely to be stopped without the cost of a substantial death toll. 53 Therefore, the development of prophylactics or therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 is imperative. 54 SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with diameters of 60-140 nanometers (Zhu et 55 al., 2020). Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, the S (spike), E (envelope), 56 M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins. The S protein is responsible for allowing the virus to attach 57 to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell. It is primed by the transmembrane serine protease 2 58 (TMPRSS2) resulting in interactions of the S1 subunit with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 59 and rearrangements in S2 to form a six-helix bundle structure that triggers fusion of the viral with the cellular 60 membrane ( Hoffmann et al., 2020; Q. Wang et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020a, 2020b). Compounds interfering 61 with the binding of the S protein to ACE2 (Ou et al., 2020; C. Wang et al., 2020) or inhibiting TMPRSS2 62 or formation of the six-helix bundle also suppress infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Xia et 63 al., 2020a, 2020b). SARS-CoV-2 is now intensely investigated to understand viral biology and pathogenesis 64 and to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines. Techniques to study and quantify SARS-CoV-2 infection and 65 replication in cell culture have quickly evolved in the past months, partially inspired by methods developed 66 for the related SARS-CoV or other (corona-) viruses. 67 SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly quantified by determining the number of infectious particles by counting 68 virus-induced plaques or foci after staining with crystal violet, neutral red (Keil et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; 69 Runfeng et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020a) or specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, e.g. against the N 70 protein (Chu et al., 2020; X. Liu et al., 2020). These antibodies are either labelled directly with horseradish 71 peroxidase (HRP) or fluorophores, or are detected by a corresponding secondary labelled antibody. The 72 number of infected cells is then detected by immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, or by manual 73 counting by microscope or with the help of computational algorithms (J. Liu et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; 74 Ou et al., 2020; Runfeng et al., 2020). Other methods to quantify infection rates are detection of cell-75 associated RNA by RT-qPCR (Monteil et al., 2020; Runfeng et al., 2020) or viral proteins by western 76 blotting (Ou et al., 2020), which are expensive and unsuitable for large sample numbers. Alternatively, with 77 prolonged waiting times until results are available, viral replication may be measured by determining the 78 RNA or infectious titers of progeny virus released from infected cells by RT-qPCR (Chu et al., 2020; J. Liu 79 et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), or tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) endpoint titrations (Chin et al., 80 2020; Manenti et al., 2020) and plaque assays (Keil et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Runfeng et al., 2020; Xia 81 et al., 2020a), respectively. All these assays are well established and validated but have the downside of 82 being laborious, time-consuming, lacking specificity, and the difficulty to increase sample sizes to perform 83 analysis in microtiter format which is substantial in the search for antivirals or in diagnostics. Instead of 84 counting infected cells or quantifying RNA, we here developed an in-cell ELISA that directly quantifies 85 SARS-CoV-2 infection by detecting newly synthesized S protein. The assay allows detection of all SARS-86 CoV-2 isolates tested and can be easily performed in any format including 96-well plates. It can be used to 87 measure the TCID 50 , to screen for antivirals, and to determine antiviral potencies of drugs (as inhibitory 88 concentration 50), neutralizing sera or antibodies in a timely and cost-effective manner, within only two 89 days. 90 3 Cell culture. Vero E6 (Cercopithecus aethiops derived epithelial kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's 92 modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) which was supplemented with 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf 93 serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 94 and 1x non-essential amino acids. Caco-2 (human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma) cells were grown 95 in the same media but with supplementation of 10% FCS. Calu-3 (human epithelial lung adenocarcinoma) 96 cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM, Sigma #M4655) supplemented with 10% 97 FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1x non-essential amino 98 acids. All cells were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator. 99 Virus strains and virus propagation. Viral isolate BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 (#014V-03890) and 100 BetaCoV/Netherlands/01/NL/2020 (#010V-03903) were obtained through the European Virus Archive 101 global. Virus was propagated by inoculation of 70% confluent Vero E6 in 75 cm² cell culture flasks with 102 100 µl SARS-CoV-2 isolates in 3.5 ml serum-free medium containing 1 µg/ml trypsin. Cells were incubated 103 for 2 h at 37°C, before adding 20 ml medium containing 15 mM HEPES. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 104 supernatant harvested at day 3 post inoculation when a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) was visible. Supernatants were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g to remove cellular debris, and then aliquoted and stored 106 at -80°C as virus stocks. Infectious virus titer was determined as plaque forming units or TCID 50 . 107 Virus isolation from patient samples. To isolate SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples, 50,000 Vero E6 cells 108 were seeded in 24-well plates in 500 µl medium incubated over night at 37°C. The next day, medium was 109 replaced by 400 µl of 2.5 µg/ml amphotericin B containing medium. Then, 100 µl of throat swabs that were 110 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR were titrated 5-fold on the cells and incubated for 3 to 5 days. 111 Upon visible CPE, supernatant was taken and virus expanded by inoculation of Vero E6 cell in 75 cm² flasks 112 and propagated as above described, resulting in the two viral isolates BetaCoV/Germany/Ulm/01/2020 and 113 BetaCoV/Germany/Ulm/02/2020. 114 Plaque assay. To determine plaque forming units (PFU), SARS-CoV-2 stocks were serially diluted 10-fold 115 and used to inoculate Vero E6 cells. To this end, 800,000 Vero E6 cells were seeded per 12 well in 1 ml 116 medium and cultured overnight to result in a 100% confluent cell monolayer. Medium was removed, cells 117 were washed once with PBS and 400 µl PBS were added. Cells were then inoculated with 100 µl of titrated 118 SARS-CoV-2 and incubated for 1 to 3 h at 37°C with shaking every 15 to 30 min. Next, cells were overlayed 119 with 1.5 ml of 0.8% Avicel RC-581 (FMC Corporation) in medium and incubated for 3 days. Cells were 120 fixed by adding 1 ml 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubation at room temperature for 45 min. 121 Supernatant was discarded, cells were washed with PBS once, and 0.5 ml of staining solution (0.5% crystal 122 violet and 0.1% triton in water) was added. After 20 min incubation at room temperature, the staining 123 solution was washed off with water, virus-induced plaques were counted, and PFU per ml calculated. Based 124 on the applied PFU per cell the MOIs were calculated. 125 TCID50 endpoint titration. To determine the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50), SARS-CoV-2 126 stocks were serially diluted 10-fold and used to inoculate Vero E6 or Caco-2 cells. To this end, 6,000 Vero 127 E6 or 10,000 Caco-2 cells were seeded per well in 96 flat bottom well plates in 100 µl medium and incubated 128 over night before 62 µl fresh medium was added. Next, 18 µl of titrated SARS-CoV-2 of each dilution was 129 used for inoculation, resulting in final SARS-CoV-2 dilutions of 1:10 1 to 1:10 9 on the cells in sextuplicates. Cells were then incubated for 5 days and monitored for CPE. TCID 50 /ml was calculated according to Reed 131 and Muench. 132 Establishment of the in-cell SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. To establish detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 133 6,000 Vero E6 or 10,000 Caco-2 target cells were seeded in 96 well plates in 100 µl. The next day, 62 µl 134 4 fresh medium was added and the cells were inoculated with 18 µl of a 10-fold titration series of SARS-135 CoV-2. One to three days later, SARS-CoV-2 S protein staining was assessed using an anti-SARS-CoV-2 136 S protein antibody. To this end, cells were fixed by adding 180 µl 8% PFA and 30 min of room temperature 137 incubation. Medium was then discarded and the cells permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature by adding 138 100 µl of 0.1% Triton in PBS. Cells were then washed with PBS and stained with 1:

Gui, COVID-19: Development of a robust mathematical model and simulation package with consideration for ageing population and time delay for control action and resusceptibility, Physica D (2020), doi: https://doi. The current global health emergency triggered by the pandemic COVID-19 is one of the greatest challenges mankind face in this generation. Computational simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibility, where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as well as resusceptibility with temporal immune response. Owing to huge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be better understood. The model is verified using two case studies for verification and prediction studies, based on the real-world data in South Korea and Northern Ireland, respectively.

7cd0da531fc334f03e415dfd9c940b6f8959b31a	Concerns expressed by patients regarding the Covid-19 virus offer timely information for health care providers. A Press Ganey analysis of open-ended comments in patient experience surveys reveals an appreciation for caregiver and staff professionalism during this pandemic. This is evident in the notable increase in positive comments about caregivers, starting in the middle of March 2020 in this data set of patients' comments specifically related to Covid-19. The greatest volume of negative comments is reserved for concerns around tests and treatments. While the focus of these early data could change as the pandemic progresses, the voice of the patient at this point presents unique opportunities for care delivery. What are patients saying as the Covid-19 crisis unfolds, and how are their opinions changing? And what messages are they conveying about how care might be improved -not just for the next pandemic, but right now?
3490005c69bcf7543676db9a70538bef7fac6fa6	COVID-19 pandemic caused not only many deaths around the world but also made evident technical limitations of hospital and intensive care units (ICU). The growing demand of ICU ventilators in a short lapse of time constitutes one of the main community concerns. The main goal of this communication is to give simple solutions to transform a noninvasive ventilator in an invasive one for intubated patients. The proposal can be applied in two well defined strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic: To replace anesthesia workstations, leaving those machines to be used in patients. To apply this option in COVID-19 patients by way of a therapeutic ''bridge'', waiting for the release of a ventilator in the ICU.
cc65523642d35877eebd99a6001a4d8b546f03a5	The paper describes an application of interval methods to train recurrent neural networks and investigate their behavior. The HIBA USNE multithreaded interval solver for nonlinear systems and algorithmic differentiation using ADHC are used. Using interval methods, we can not only train the network, but precisely localize all stationary points of the network. Preliminary numerical results for continuous Hopfield-like networks are presented. Let us focus on a simple model, similar to popular Hopfield networks, described, i.a., in [18] . There is only a single layer and each neuron is connected to all other ones. Figure 1 illustrates this architecture. Let us present the mathematical formulae. Following [10], we denote vectors by small letters and matrices -by capital ones.

8ca5c78ec5f501e6fce3871f35b880fbbad06c64	Background: COVID-19 has become one of the most serious global epidemics in the 21st Century. This study aims to explore the distribution of research capabilities of countries, institutions, and researchers, and the hotspots and frontiers of coronavirus research in the past two decades. In it, references for funding support of urgent projects and international cooperation among research institutions are provided. Method: the Web of Science core collection database was used to retrieve the documents related to coronavirus published from 2003 to 2020. Citespace.5.6.R2, VOSviewer1.6.12, and Excel 2016 were used for bibliometric analysis. Results: 11,036 documents were retrieved, of which China and the United States have contributed the most coronavirus studies, Hong Kong University being the top contributor. Regarding journals, the Journal of Virology has contributed the most, while in terms of researchers, Yuen Kwok Yung has made the most contributions. The proportion of documents published by international cooperation has been rising for decades. Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are under development, and clinical trials of several drugs are ongoing. Conclusions: international cooperation is an important way to accelerate research progress and achieve success. Developing corresponding vaccines and drugs are the current hotspots and research directions. ) [2] . Although SARS-CoV-2 has a lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV, it is more infectious [3] . As soon as the SARS-CoV-2 strains were isolated, research work on tracking, detection, and vaccine and drug development of the coronavirus was immediately launched worldwide [4, 5] . As of 10 April 2020, it has spread to 205 countries and regions around the world, with a total of 1,610,788 confirmed cases and a total of 95,878 deaths. The total confirmed cases in the United States, Italy, Spain, France, and Germany have all reached 120,000, and public health emergencies have been declared in all of these countries [6] . In this study, CiteSpace5.6.R2, VOSviewer1.6.12, and Excel2016 were used to analyze the coronavirus literature published since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Through the analysis of the research capabilities of countries, institutions, and authors, and of the hotspots and frontiers of coronavirus research [7], references are provided for funding support of urgent projects and international cooperation among research institutions.
bc04f5c90e69db962c4cdcb7480bd1006e72833a	US public health authorities claim imposing quarantines on healthcare workers returning from West Africa is incorrect according to science. Their positions rely upon a set of studies and experience about outbreaks and transmission mechanisms in Africa as well as assumptions about what those studies imply about outbreaks in the US. According to this view the probability of a single infection is low and that of a major outbreak is non-existent. In a series of brief reports we will provide insight into why properties of networks of contagion that are not considered in traditional statistics suggest that risks are higher than those assumptions suggest. We begin with the difference between thin and fat tailed distributions applied to the number of infected individuals that can arise from a single one. Traditional epidemiological models consider the contagion process as described by R 0 , the average number of new infected individuals arising from a single case. However, in a complex interdependent society it is possible for the actual number due to a single individual to dramatically differ from the average number, with severe consequences for the ability to contain an outbreak when it is just beginning. Our analysis raises doubts about the scientific validity of policy recommendations of public health authorities. We also point out that existing CDC public health policies and actions are inconsistent with their claims.
8f9d7af1de35597afd63e7dcc19618d50d960fb4	Arising from the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been rapidly spreading since its first presentation in late 2019. The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on the 11th March 2020, and as of 29th of April 2020 more than 3 million cases have been reported worldwide with over 225 000 confirmed deaths. Where mechanical ventilation may not be enough, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could play a role as a form of rescue therapy and may provide beneficial results in the hands of skilled clinicians in centers with experience of using ECMO appropriately in selected patients. Our understanding of COVID-19 is ever-changing and the need for intensive care beds is rising, which means that ECMO will surely play a key role in the near future.

706b1c8434300a1a41f466587aeba907a8138a17	We report on an extensive structure-activity relationship study of novel PI4K IIIb inhibitors. The purine derivative of the potent screening hit T-00127-HEV1 has served as a suitable starting point for a thorough investigation of positions 8 and 2. While position 8 of the purine scaffold can only bear a small substituent to maintain the inhibitory activity, position 2 is opened for extensive modification and can accommodate even substituted phenyl rings without the loss of PI4K IIIb inhibitory activity. These empirical observations nicely correlate with the results of our docking study, which suggests that position 2 directs towards solution and can provide the necessary space for the interaction with remote residues of the enzyme, whereas the cavity around position 8 is strictly limited. The obtained compounds have also been subjected to antiviral screening against a panel of (+)ssRNA viruses.
636ad93af46bd1b94029c0897da253cc10725a25	Social Media can be used to extract discussion topics during a disaster. With the COVID-19 pandemic impact on South Africa, we need to understand how the law and regulation promulgated by the government in response to the pandemic contrasts with discussion topics social media users have been engaging in. In this work, we expand on traditional media analysis by using Social Media discussions driven by or directed to South African government officials. We find topics that are similar as well as different in some cases. The findings can inform further study into social media during disaster settings in South Africa and beyond.
8bc4196f8725e6f8fce6cda01bbfa15286862294	This paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 in China. We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.
6d44df76bea55d5b791f6fdacf188ddc72b19eb8	Novel viral diagnostic tools need to be affordable, fast, accurate and easy to use with sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to current standards. At present, viral diagnostics are based on direct detection of viral components or indirect detection by measuring antibodies generated in response to viral infection. While sensitivity of detection and quantification are still important challenges, we expect major advances from new assay formats and synthetic binding molecules, such as aptamers. Compared to traditional antibody-based detection, aptamers could provide faster adaptation to continuously evolving virus strains and higher discriminating capacity between specific virus serotypes. Aptamers are very stable and easily modifiable, so are ideal molecules for detection and chemical sensing applications. Here, we review the use of aptasensors for detection of viral pathogens and consider the feasibility of aptasensors to become standard devices for point-of-care diagnostics of viruses.
fb7ee8d632ed0fd6ff544b2faa7b59ca818ca851	To clarify the association of cluster number and size of coronavirus disease 2019 in long-term care (LTC) hospitals/facilities, general medical/welfare facilities, and non-medical/welfare facilities, with morbidity and mortality in 47 prefectures during Jan 15 -May 9, 2020 in Japan. Methods: Information on COVID-19 clusters (n >2) and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 was collected. Results: A total of 381 clusters with 3,786 infected cases were collected, accounting for 23.9% of 15,852 cumulated cases on May 9, 2020. Although the cluster number (/10 7 subjects) in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly smaller compared to those in the other two groups, the cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly larger than that in non-medical/welfare facilities. Cluster numbers in general medical/welfare facilities and in non-medical/welfare facilities were significantly positively correlated with morbidity (/10 5 ), indicating relatively early identification of clusters in these facilities. Unlike in these facilities, cluster size in LTC hospitals/facilities was significantly positively correlated with morbidity, indicating that clusters in LCT hospitals/facilities were finally identified after already having grown to a large size in areas where infection was prevalent. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that both cluster number and cluster size only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently associated with higher mortality (> median: 0.64/10 5 subjects) after adjustment. Preventive efforts against COVID-19 outbreaks even at the early phase of the epidemic are critically important in LTC hospitals/facilities, since both larger number and size of cluster only in LTC hospitals/facilities were independently linked to higher mortality in prefectures in Japan. <248 words>

0ff5bc239964a0d2cb69e68461dbaae3b322580b	Background: the COVID-19 has been successfully contained in China but is spreading all over the world. We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population. Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with .

Pathogens in mucus (artificial mucus or sputum samples) were not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants (survival rate >10%), suggesting that the alcohol-based disinfectants were ineffective. Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient >0.7, P < 0.001). Additionally, the ethanol diffusion rate decreased with increasing mucus viscosity, which contributed to ethanol resistance. Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P < 0.001 for all). In contrast, complete inactivation was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation independently of mucus viscosity. Thus, mucus viscosity contributes to resistance of pathogens to alcohol-based disinfectants by decreasing the alcohol diffusion rate. These findings can provide a basis for developing new strategies, including improved disinfectants, for overcoming HAI. Healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs) such as nosocomial influenza outbreak are major problems in medicine, which have yet to be resolved 1-4 . The simplest and most effective means of preventing HAI is maintaining good hand hygiene 5 . The use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) has spread around the world since the Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings was released by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in 2002 6 . Based on this and the 2009 World Health Organization Guideline on Hand Hygiene in Health Care 7 , most clinical settings have adopted the practice of keeping hands, which are not visibly contaminated, clean using ABHRs. However, HAI in medical facilities has not been completely prevented, which is partly due to lack of compliance among medical staff; indeed, a reduction in HAI incidence has been linked to greater compliance 5,8-11 . However, some studies suggest that there may be room for improvement in standard hand hygiene practices 12,13 . Methods for evaluating the efficacy of disinfectants by adding a load material (e.g., foetal bovine serum or bovine serum albumin) have been established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and European Committee for Standardization (CEN) 14-17 . However, not only contaminating proteins but also other factors of body fluid could decrease the efficacy of alcohol-based disinfectants. Revealing the factors could enable the development of hand hygiene that is more suited to clinical needs, and could contribute to prevention of HAI. Mucus (viscous body fluids such as sputum or nasal discharge) contain large amounts of mucin, which has a central protein core with multiple polysaccharide chains. Epithelial mucins are high-molecular weight glycoproteins that provide viscosity and gel-forming ability to mucus 18 . The thick epithelial mucus layer has a barrier function that is attributed to its high viscosity and protects the mucosal epithelium from gastric acid, digestive

It hinges on visual development of the interface and business logic but also on easy integration with data stores and services while delivering robust applications that scale. Data integration increasingly means accessing a variety of NoSQL stores. Unfortunately, the diversity of data and processing models, that make them useful in the first place, is difficult to reconcile with the simplification of abstractions exposed to developers in a low-code platform. Moreover, NoSQL data stores also rely on a variety of general purpose and custom scripting languages as their main interfaces. In this paper we report on building a polyglot data access layer for the OutSystems Platform that uses SQL with optional embedded script snippets to bridge the gap between low-code and full access to NoSQL stores.
9194a78bdd70e38a7086cd0c7deabd9cf7f3a48b	In the spring semester of 2020, colleges and universities adopted online teaching as the primary modality due to campus closure for social distancing. While lectures could be more readily converted to online classes, biology labs were challenging to handle since students could not physically conduct experiments in lab classrooms. In the present report, various online teaching materials, including educational and research videos, simulation labs, and real research data, were utilized to achieve the learning objectives of the originally in-person lab classes of an upper-level undergraduate genetics course. Furthermore, certain advantages of online teaching, such as detailed and high-quality annotation of lecture slides using the Apple Pencil and iPad, were observed. While
e4504200cd45f51eca63ceff61f407fd062ce38f	Now, it has been evidenced that Covid19 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the brain tissues. Along with this, a challenge has been raised for research professionals to find effective drugs for its treatment since the recent spread of this virus from Wuhan, China. Targeting the treatment of brain infection, it has also been a challenge that the clinical drug should have good CNS penetration ability to cross the blood−brain barrier.
532e417a66dbe4822a3f8f9b496c105ccc7dd412	Among approximately 1000 adenoviruses from chimpanzees and bonobos studied recently, the Pan Adenovirus type 3 (PanAd3, isolated from a bonobo, Pan paniscus) has one of the best profiles for a vaccine vector, combining potent transgene immunogenicity with minimal pre-existing immunity in the human population. In this study, we inserted into a replication defective PanAd3 a transgene expressing a fusion protein of conserved influenza antigens nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 1 (M1). We then studied antibody and T cell responses as well as protection from challenge infection in a mouse model. A single intranasal administration of PanAd3-NPM1 vaccine induced strong antibody and T cell responses, and protected against high dose lethal influenza virus challenge. Thus PanAd3 is a promising candidate vector for vaccines, including universal influenza vaccines.
785b4fd92a0b90e2a4240595dfd0a8df68814188	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease in which the myelin sheaths around the axons of the brain and spinal cord are damaged, leading to demyelination and scarring as well as a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms. It is caused by an autoimmune response to self-antigens in a genetically susceptible individual induced by unknown environmental factors. Principal cells of the immune system that drive the immunopathological processes are T cells, especially of T H 1 and T H 17 subsets. However, in recent years, it was disclosed that regulatory T cells took part in, too. Subsequently, there was endeavour to develop ways how to reestablish their physiological functions. In this review, we describe known mechanisms of action, efficacy, and side-effects of contemporary and emerging MS immunotherapeutical agents on Treg cells and other cells of the immune system involved in the immunopathogenesis of the disease. Furthermore, we discuss how laboratory immunology can offer physicians its help in the diagnosis process and decisions what kind of biological therapy should be used.
83c33f01d7a8c1abca6dedf7e12e485fc7ed6ed3	Cortex phellodendri is used to reduce fever and remove dampness and toxin. Berberine is an active ingredient of C. phellodendri. Berberine from Argemone ochroleuca can relax airway smooth muscle (ASM); however, whether the nonberberine component of C. phellodendri has similar relaxant action was unclear. An n-butyl alcohol extract of C. phellodendri (NBAECP, nonberberine component) was prepared, which completely inhibits high K + -and acetylcholine-(ACH-) induced precontraction of airway smooth muscle in tracheal rings and lung slices from control and asthmatic mice, respectively. The contraction induced by high K + was also blocked by nifedipine, a selective blocker of L-type Ca 2+ channels. The ACH-induced contraction was partially inhibited by nifedipine and pyrazole 3, an inhibitor of TRPC3 and STIM/Orai channels. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NBAECP can relax ASM by inhibiting L-type Ca 2+ channels and TRPC3 and/or STIM/Orai channels, suggesting that NBAECP could be developed to a new drug for relieving bronchospasm.
28ecacb70247f4fb6a4923a99d0905153c23f88a	Background: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 100,000 deaths in the USA. Our institution has treated over 2000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics including the persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Results: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-White. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (24%), and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (> 70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p < 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-White race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. The median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. (Continued on next page) Conclusions: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia was associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to the identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcomes in future outbreaks of COVID-19.
fc109bf912f9cb4063e7d786b86b6517d40087c1	In a few weeks, the global community has witnessed, and for some of us experienced first-hand, the human costs of the COVID-19 pandemic.
c5fa97f3c08e5b88b1081d261c675cf9f0fea73b	We conducted a challenge/rechallenge trial in which 3 alpacas were infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The alpacas shed virus at challenge but were refractory to further shedding at rechallenge on day 21. The trial indicates that alpacas may be suitable models for infection and shedding dynamics of this virus.
2f436af74462e6c1fc251d8b1a70ab26da3a7ea4	Purpose This study aimed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of fracture in the elderly during the COVID-19. Methods This was a retrospective multi-centre study, which included patients who sustained fractures between 20 January and 19 February 2020. The collected data included patients' demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality. SPSS 23.0 was used to describe the data and perform some analysis. Results A total of 436 patients with 453 fractures were included; there were 153 males and 283 females, with an average age of 76.2 years (standard deviation, SD, 7.7 years; 65 to 105). For either males or females, 70-74 years was the most commonly involved age group. A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home. Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%. Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453). Most fractures (95.8%, 434/453) were treated surgically, and 4.2% (19/453) were treated by plaster fixation or traction. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453).
489853008e6dc1123605d1feb74db9c466e19342	Won Hee Lee, PhD, 425 N 5 th St, Bldg ABC1 Rm 426, Phoenix, AZ 85004, USA. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Early data suggest that the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 appear to be higher among patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in cardiomyocytes, there has been no conclusive evidence of direct viral infection although the presence of inflammation and viral genome within the hearts of COVID-19 patients have been reported. Here we transduced A549 lung epithelial cells with lentivirus overexpressing selected genes of the SARS-CoV-2. We then isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the supernatant of A549 cells and detected the presence of viral RNA within the purified EVs. Importantly, we observed that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were able to actively uptake these EVs and viral genes were subsequently detected in the cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, uptake of EVs containing viral genes led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing EVs represent an indirect route of viral RNA entry into cardiomyocytes.
89417a213d7269097baabcd312fff5f339137bbc	The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed patients and healthcare givers alike and challenged our practice of antenatal care, including fetal diagnosis and therapy. This document aims to review relevant recent information to allow us to optimize prenatal care delivery. We discuss potential modifications to obstetric management and fetal procedures in SARS-CoV2-negative and SARS-CoV2-positive patients with fetal anomalies or disorders. Most fetal therapies are time sensitive and cannot be delayed. If personnel and resources are available, we should continue to offer procedures of proven benefit, acknowledging any fetal and maternal risks, including those to health care workers. There is, to date, minimal, unconfirmed evidence of spontaneous vertical transmission, though it may theoretically be increased with some procedures. Knowing a mother's preoperative SARS-CoV-2 status would enable us to avoid or defer certain procedures while she is contagious and to protect health care workers appropriately. Some fetal conditions may alternatively be managed neonatally. Counseling regarding fetal interventions which have a possibility of additional intra-or postoperative morbidity must be performed in the context of local resource availability. Procedures of unproven benefit should not be offered. We encourage participation in registries and trials that may help us to understand the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women, their fetuses, and neonates. This is a multidisciplinary and international paper with contributions according to expertise and experience. All of the authors have contributed to the concept, writing, and revision of this paper.
307ea5150bd1b625a89a5b2592f31fec69200cf0	Clinical microbiologists have a new and unique opportunity to increase our value to health care by broadening how we think about disease processes and asking ourselves what we can do to help resolve a disease, assist in tracking a cause, or even predict an outbreak before it occurs. Human health, animal health (both wildlife and domestic animals), and environmental health are forever bound together. The convergence of people, animals, and the environment defines the parameters of One Health and directs attention to the impact this overlap has on public health, disease detection, and control. One Health (sometimes referred to as One Medicine) is a concept that promotes, improves, and defends the health and well-being of all species through the integration of the sciences of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and environmental studies. As microbiologists, we need to be aware of this One Health concept and how it can positively impact our profession by allowing us to be more productive members of the health care team. There are several things we can do to get started. We can review organism pathogenicity and evaluate and question test results that may signal an unusual event or process that led to a disease. We can be alert to the epidemiologic potential of organism isolates from patients as they may apply to infection control or community epidemiology. We can become familiar with the zoonotic diseases and recognize the etiologic agents associated with wild and domestic animals and apply that knowledge to our diagnostic skills. As we further understand the "big picture" of One Health, we can ask strategic questions that can lead us to provide further technical assistance to facilitate earlier interventions that lead to positive patient outcomes and ultimately healthier populations. In human medicine, we generally work with one species of animal. Veterinarians work with all the rest. It is time to communicate with and learn from our veterinary clinical microbiology colleagues and begin to understand the critical nature of the human, animal, and environment interface. This is our opportunity to be at the front of this line and not stand on the sidelines watching.
574efe7771ff8495c4ace678a489b0a0869b0834	Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a soluble pattern recognition receptor that is a humoral component of the innate immune system. It interacts with pathogenic moieties, infected and dying host cells and facilitates their removal through activation of appropriate innate and adaptive mechanisms. PTX3 is secreted by a diverse variety of cells, ranging from immune cells to structural cells, in response to Toll like receptor (TLR) engagement, inflammatory stimuli, and physical and chemical stress. Further, PTX3 plays an essential role in female fertility as it facilitates the organization of extracellular matrix in the cumulus oophorus. Such activity is also implicated in post-inflammation tissue repair. PTX3 is a multifunctional protein and plays a non-redundant role in providing immunity against potential immunological dangers. Thus, we assessed its role in lung immunity, as lungs are at a constant risk of infections and tissue damage that is attributable to perpetual exposure to foreign agents.
10552125b8bfb2261ea55c54cca6c235b5b3e553	BACKGROUND ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a fatal cardiovascular emergency requiring rapid reperfusion treatment. During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical professionals need to strike a balance between providing timely treatment for STEMI patients and implementing infection control procedures to prevent nosocomial spread of COVID-19 among health care workers and other vulnerable cardiovascular patients. the study analyzed how the COVID-19 outbreak and China Chest Pain Center's modified STEMI protocol influenced the number of admitted STEMI cases, reperfusion strategy, key treatment time points, and in-hospital mortality and heart failure for STEMI patients. The COVID-19 outbreak reduced the number of STEMI cases reported to China Chest Pain Centers. Consistent with China Chest Pain Center's modified STEMI protocol, the percentage of patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention declined while the percentage of patients undergoing thrombolysis increased. With an average delay of approximately 20 min for reperfusion therapy, the rate of in-hospital mortality and in-hospital heart failure increased during the outbreak, but the rate of in-hospital hemorrhage remained stable. CONCLUSIONS There were reductions in STEMI patients' access to care, delays in treatment timelines, changes in reperfusion strategies, and an increase of in-hospital mortality and heart failure during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.

cc03e915afeb7acfe93595b75a38f7b58bf2d752	Background and Aim: Avian coronavirus has a wide range of hosts, from chickens and turkeys to wild birds. This virus causes an economically and, possibly, environmentally, important loss in the poultry industry. Therefore, research into the avian coronavirus in various species of birds is required. The Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) is an endemic bird to Indonesia and Northern Australia and often kept as pets. At present, there has been limited information about avian coronavirus infection among birds. This study aimed to determine the presence of and to characterize avian coronavirus isolated from Eclectus parrots in Indonesia. Cloacal swab samples were taken from 10 healthy Eclectus parrots (E. roratus). Each isolate was propagated into specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. The presence of avian coronavirus was determined using three sets of primers targeting the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of avian coronavirus (UTR41+/11−), the N gene of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBVN+/−), and the S1 gene of the IBV (XCE2+/XCE2−). The infectious bronchitis vaccine strain H120 was used as a positive control. Resulting positive bands were sequenced for the S1 gene. Results: None of the isolates was positive for the 3'-UTR, four isolates were positive for the N gene of infectious bronchitis, and two isolates were positive for the S1 gene of the IBV. However, only one isolate (parrot/Indonesia/BX9/16) was sequenced for the partial S1 gene with primers XCE2+/XCE2−. The partial nucleotide sequence of this isolate showed 100% homology with the IBV GI-13 lineage, specifically with a field isolate of the 4/91 variant 1 Israel and the 4/91 vaccine on the hypervariable region 3 site of the S1 gene. An IB-like avian coronavirus was isolated from healthy Eclectus parrots. Our results indicate that IBV has a wide range of hosts, which prompt the need to understand the interspecies connection of this virus better.

3fb9e68b962cbe9bb678fa69f66e77351bb27849	Background: Immunosuppressive therapy for renal allograft recipients has changed substantially since the introduction of the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, basiliximab. We hypothesized that recent improvements in immunosuppressive treatment may reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study aimed to investigate transitional changes in the incidence of OFNH among renal transplant recipients by MRI. Methods: Participants comprised 110 patients who had undergone renal transplantation from 2003 to 2012, during which time basiliximab was in regular use at our institute (Recent group), and 232 patients who had undergone RT between 1986 and 2003 (Past group). We compared ONFH incidence between the two groups and evaluated risk factors for ONFH, including immunosuppressants (calcineurin inhibitors, basiliximab, and/or steroids) and postoperative renal function. Results: Incidence of ONFH was lower in the Recent group (0%) than in the Past group (3.4%; p ¼ 0.043). In the Recent group, age was greater, ABO/human leukocyte antigen incompatibility was worse, while steroid dose was decreased and post-transplant renal function was improved. Cumulative methylprednisolone dose at postoperative week 2 and delayed graft function were identified as risk factors for ONFH. Conclusion: Risk of ONFH after renal transplantation has fallen with the advent of regular use of basiliximab, although this agent does not appear to be a factor directly associated with the incidence of ONFH. Study design: Clinical prognostic study (Level III case control study).
69165cc347bc5b2fec075db662d701c8341ff599	Decannulation is an essential step in liberating tracheostomised patients from mechanical ventilation. This procedure is purely based on the clinician's judgment and there is no universally accepted protocol to date for this vital procedure. This study aimed to describe decannulation practice and failure rates in patients with tracheostomy and to determine the factors associated with the outcome of tube removal. A prospective study was done on 50 patients (both sexes) who required a tracheostomy and cared for at Command Hospital Bangalore Center between January 2019 and April 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential tests. Out of the 50 decannulation decisions, 7 patients experienced decannulation failures giving a failure rate of 14%. Out of the 7 decannulation failure cases, about 4 patients (10%) experienced difficulty in swallowing and 3 patients (2%) experienced stridor. There was no associated mortality. A decannulation failure of 14% was seen in this study in tracheostomised patients after prolonged mechanical ventilation. Various factors govern the success of tracheostomy decannulation procedures which occur during the first 24-48 h after decannulation. Lack of swallowing/secretions/cough management and the development of stridor were the commonest cause of decannulation failure in this study.

Coronavirus causes a wide variety of respiratory infections and it is an RNA-type virus that can infect both humans and animal species. It often causes pneumonia in humans. Artificial intelligence models have been helpful for successful analyses in the biomedical field. In this study, Coronavirus was detected using a deep learning model, which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence. Our dataset consists of three classes namely: coronavirus, pneumonia, and normal X-ray imagery. In this study, the data classes were restructured using the Fuzzy Color technique as a preprocessing step and the images that were structured with the original images were stacked. In the next step, the stacked dataset was trained with deep learning models (MobileNetV2, SqueezeNet) and the feature sets obtained by the models were processed using the Social Mimic optimization method. Thereafter, efficient features were combined and classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The overall classification rate obtained with the proposed approach was 99.27%. With the proposed approach in this study, it is evident that the model can efficiently contribute to the detection of COVID-19 disease. • The original dataset was restructured with the Fuzzy Color technique and two datasets were stacked. • Efficient features were selected by applying Social Mimic optimization to feature sets extracted from CNN models. • The efficient features obtained were combined, and classified with a success rate of 99.27% with SVM method.

4b3e454f57edd89563485c04da1df5f95ebd2b5e	The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) open reading frame 7a (ORF 7a) encodes a 122 amino acid accessory protein. It has no significant sequence homology with any other known proteins. The 7a protein is present in the virus particle and has been shown to interact with several host proteins; thereby implicating it as being involved in several pathogenic processes including apoptosis, inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, and activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. In this study we present data demonstrating that the SARS-CoV 7a protein interacts with human Ap 4 A-hydrolase (asymmetrical diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, EC 3.6.1.17). Ap 4 A-hydrolase is responsible for metabolizing the "allarmone" nucleotide Ap 4 A and therefore likely involved in regulation of cell proliferation, DNA replication, RNA processing, apoptosis and DNA repair. The interaction between 7a and Ap 4 A-hydrolase was identified using yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cultured human cells transiently expressing V5-His tagged 7a and HA tagged Ap 4 A-hydrolase. Human tissue culture cells transiently expressing 7a and Ap 4 A-hydrolase tagged with EGFP and Ds-Red2 respectively show these proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm.
446e0b1d8aca5b31023eeaa2797ba4a782268a0a	Viral diseases such as influenza, which are easily transferable from person to person or even country to country, pose one of the biggest threats to health today. Viruses such as avian influenza viruses (N1H5 and H9N1) have been reported to spread in the present decade and, very recently, the novel coronavirus that has caused many life-threatening illnesses and deaths all around the world has received much attention. To prevent these highly contagious viral infections, we have proposed the combination of IMODä and Arbidol to increase their immunomodulatory effects as a novel medicine to prevent and cure influenza and some other infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C. On the one hand, IMODä within the last few years has been proven to safely and effectively increase the life expectancy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals by increasing CD4 lymphocytes. On the other hand, Arbidol, an antiviral agent has been used safely and effectively in the past two decades to prevent and cure all types of influenza and flu. Therefore, the combination of both in a single dosage to further increase CD4 lymphocytes and interferon gamma (IFN-c) could be a better choice for treatment of viral infections. This proposal tries to provide enough support and background for approval of a randomized clinical trial by a relevant team of investigators. ª 2014 Published
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	Acute infectious gastroenteritis cases in Shanghai, reported over three years, were analyzed. Pathogens were identified in 1031 patients; of these, 725 and 306 were bacterial and viral cases, respectively. Vibrio parahemolyticus and Salmonella were the dominant bacteria, and Caliciviridae and Reoviridae were the dominant viral families in the local area. The acute gastroenteritis epidemic peaks appeared in August and January, which represented the active peak periods of bacteria and viruses, respectively. Logistic regression analyses with sex stratification showed that abdominal pain, fever and ingestion of unsafe food at restaurants were independent factors more frequently associated with bacterial gastroenteritis irrespective of sex; red cell-positive fecal matter was associated with bacterial gastroenteritis with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.28 only in males; and white blood cell count was associated with bacterial gastroenteritis with an OR of 1.02 only in females. Pathogen stratification showed that age, vomiting and red cell-positive fecal matter were associated with males with ORs of 0.99, 0.61 and 1.71, respectively, in bacterial gastroenteritis; and the migrant ratio was higher in males with an OR of 2.29 only in viral gastroenteritis. In conclusion, although bacterial and viral gastroenteritis shared many features, epidemiological and clinical factors differed between sexes and pathogens. Acute gastroenteritis is a common disease that is usually caused by viral, bacterial or parasitic infections in the digestive tract 1 . Outbreaks and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis occur throughout the year and pose a major public health burden worldwide 1-3 . Most causes of acute gastroenteritis are foodborne or waterborne due to the contamination of a pathogen toxin and/or toxic microorganism 4 . Of the infectious causes of acute gastroenteritis, it is estimated that 50-70%, 15-20% and 10-15% are caused by viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, respectively 1 . In general, acute viral gastroenteritis peaks in the autumn and winter seasons, and the peak of acute bacterial gastroenteritis appears in summer 1-3 . The main clinical manifestations of acute gastroenteritis are sudden-onset vomiting or diarrhea with or without accompanying nausea, fever, or abdominal pain 4-6 . It is hard for clinicians to differentiate viral gastroenteritis from gastroenteritis caused by bacterial agents on the basis of clinical manifestations alone 7 . Although viral gastroenteritis manifests abruptly with vomiting and watery diarrhea, often accompanied by low-grade fever and abdominal cramps, these clinical manifestations are always shared by bacterial gastroenteritis 6-8 . Thus, further evaluation of differences in sex, infection source, transmission route, symptoms as well as clinical laboratory tests between viral and bacterial gastroenteritis has clinical significance. In addition, Shanghai is an international metropolis that had 24.2 million residents and 320 million tourists in the year of 2017, and high population density is a major factor promoting acute gastroenteritis epidemics 2,3,9-12 . So far, long-term acute gastroenteritis surveillance data with a large sample size from Shanghai are still scarce. Furthermore, the pathogenic spectrum of acute infectious gastroenteritis prevalent in the local area remains unclear. In this report, acute gastroenteritis surveillance data collected over a three-year span from two sentinel hospitals in Shanghai are presented. The epidemiological and clinical differences between viral and bacterial gastroenteritis as well as between the sexes and the spectrum of acute gastroenteritis-related viruses and bacteria in the local area were evaluated.
0b5012239e6f37fcdd7a64dd34947605f94c455c	Canine parvovirus (CPV) is one of the most common causes of acute haemorrhagic enteritis in young dogs, while clinical diagnosis is often indecisive. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an in-clinic rapid test in the detection of CPV infection in dogs. To this end, we compared the Rapid Diagnostic Kit of Canine Parvovirus, Coronavirus and Rotavirus antigen (Quicking ® ) to PCR, which is considered as the most reliable diagnostic method. A total of 78 duplicated faecal samples were collected from diarrhoeic dogs. Vaccination history within a month prior to the onset of diarrhoea was reported for 12 of the sampled dogs. The rapid diagnostic test was performed in 23 of the faecal samples directly, while the rest were placed into a sterile cotton tipped swab suitable for collection and transportation of viruses (Sigma -VCM ® ) and stored at −20 • C. The sensitivity of the Quicking rapid diagnostic test compared to PCR in the total number of samples, in samples from non-vaccinated dogs and in samples tested directly after collection were 22.22% (95% CI: 13.27-33.57%), 26.67% (95% CI: 16.08-39.66%) and 76.47% (95% CI: 50.10-93.04%) respectively, while the specificity of the test was 100% in any case. In conclusion, negative results do not exclude parvoenteritis from the differential diagnosis, especially in dogs with early vaccination history, but a positive result almost certainly indicates CPV infection. An improved sensitivity may be expected when the test is performed immediately.

Thus the mobility patterns of individuals are crucial in understanding disease dynamics. Here we study the impact of human mobility on HIV transmission in different parts of Kenya. We build an SIR metapopulation model that incorporates the different regions within the country. We parameterise the model using census data, HIV data and mobile phone data adopted to track human mobility. We found that movement between different regions appears to have a relatively small overall effect on the total increase in HIV cases in Kenya. However, the most important consequence of movement patterns was transmission of the disease from high infection to low prevalence areas. Mobility slightly increases HIV incidence rates in regions with initially low HIV prevalences and slightly decreases incidences in regions with initially high HIV prevalence. We discuss how regional HIV models could be used in public-health planning. This paper is a first attempt to model spread of HIV using mobile phone data, and we also discuss limitations to the approach.

Structure-based vaccine design for RSV F, influenza HA, HIV-1 Env. Structure-based vaccine design translated into the clinic. The recent explosion of atomic-level structures of glycoproteins that comprise the surface antigens of human enveloped viruses, such as RSV, influenza, hepatitis C and HIV, provide tremendous opportunities for rational, structure-based vaccine design. Several concepts in structure-based vaccine design have been put into practice and are are well along preclinical and clinical implementation. Testing of these designed immunogens will provide key insights into the ability to induce the desired immune responses, namely neutralizing antibodies. Many of these immunogens in human clinical trials represent only the first wave of designs and will likely require continued tweaking and elaboration to achieve the ultimate result of ever increasingly breadth and potency. Considerable effort is now being invested in germline targeting, epitope focusing, and improved immune presentation such as multivalent nanoparticle incorporation. This review highlights some of the recent advances in these areas as we prepare for the next generation of immunogens for subsequent rounds of iterative vaccine development.

cb4f5f35816826a7e3970f11e6948d58e2101adc	Background. The correct management of immunocompromised patients with pneumonia is debated. We evaluated the prevalence, risk factors, and characteristics of immunocompromised patients coming from the community with pneumonia. Methods. We conducted a secondary analysis of an international, multicenter study enrolling adult patients coming from the community with pneumonia and hospitalized in 222 hospitals in 54 countries worldwide. Risk factors for immunocompromise included AIDS, aplastic anemia, asplenia, hematological cancer, chemotherapy, neutropenia, biological drug use, lung transplantation, chronic steroid use, and solid tumor. Results. At least 1 risk factor for immunocompromise was recorded in 18% of the 3702 patients enrolled. The prevalences of risk factors significantly differed across continents and countries, with chronic steroid use (45%), hematological cancer (25%), and chemotherapy (22%) the most common. Among immunocompromised patients, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pathogens were the most frequently identified, and prevalences did not differ from those in immunocompetent patients. Risk factors for immunocompromise were independently associated with neither Pseudomonas aeruginosa nor non-community-acquired bacteria. Specific risk factors were independently associated with fungal infections (odds ratio for AIDS and hematological cancer, 15.10 and 4.65, respectively; both P = .001), mycobacterial infections (AIDS; P = .006), and viral infections other than influenza (hematological cancer, 5.49; P < .001). Conclusions. Our findings could be considered by clinicians in prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP in immunocompromised patients. Patients with AIDS and hematological cancer admitted with CAP may have higher prevalences of fungi, mycobacteria, and noninfluenza viruses.
eb74204db3e80e6ff6e673fa13447f9d94749506	Objective: To summarize significant research contributions on ethics in medical informatics published in 2019. Methods: An extensive search using PubMed/Medline was conducted to identify the scientific contributions published in 2019 that address ethics issues in medical informatics. The selection process comprised three steps: 1) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors; 2) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper; and 3) the final selection of three best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the Yearbook. Results: The three selected best papers explore timely issues of concern to the community and demonstrate how ethics considerations influence applied informatics. Conclusion: With regard to ethics in informatics, data sharing and privacy remain primary areas of concern. Ethics issues related to the development and implementation of artificial intelligence is an emerging topic of interest.
15253c08a446817c195eab73473fc2f215528705	Many proteins and signaling pathways participate in anti-viral host responses. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a subset of non-coding RNAs greater than 200 nucleotides in length, have been recently described as critical regulators in viral infections. Accumulating research indicates that lncRNAs are important in the development and progression of infectious diseases. LncRNAs are not only involved in anti-viral responses, but in many different virus-host interactions, some of which may be beneficial to the virus. Here we review the current knowledge regarding host and viral lncRNAs and their roles in viral infections. In addition, the potential of using lncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers is discussed.
15a0a1f83c9f096d245ed2c77d96f3bdf0a2f95a	Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections continue to be a serious emerging disease problem internationally with well over 1000 cases and a major outbreak outside of the Middle East region. While the hypothesis that dromedary camels are the likely major source of MERS-CoV infection in humans is gaining acceptance, conjecture continues over the original natural reservoir host(s) and specifically the role of bats in the emergence of the virus. Dromedary camels were imported to Australia, principally between 1880 and 1907 and have since become a large feral population inhabiting extensive parts of the continent. Here we report that during a focussed surveillance study, no serological evidence was found for the presence of MERS-CoV in the camels in the Australian population. This finding presents various hypotheses about the timing of the emergence and spread of MERS-CoV throughout populations of camels in Africa and Asia, which can be partially resolved by testing sera from camels from the original source region, which we have inferred was mainly northwestern Pakistan. In addition, we identify bat species which overlap (or neighbour) the range of the Australian camel population with a higher likelihood of carrying CoVs of the same lineage as MERS-CoV. Both of these proposed follow-on studies are examples of "proactive surveillance", a concept that has particular relevance to a One Health approach to emerging zoonotic diseases with a complex epidemiology and aetiology.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Graphical abstract Abstract The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a global pandemic, but specific medicines and vaccines are still being developed. In China, interventional therapies with traditional Chinese medicine for COVID-19 have achieved significant clinical efficacies, but the underlying pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear. This article reviewed the etiology of COVID-19 and clinical efficacy. Both network pharmacological study and literature search were used to demonstrate the possible action mechanisms of Chinese medicines in treating COVID-19. We found that Chinese medicines played the role of antivirus, anti-inflammation and immunoregulation, and target organs protection in the management of COVID-19 by multiple components J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 acting on multiple targets at multiple pathways. AEC2 and 3CL protein could be the direct targets for inhibiting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, isorhamnetin, baicalein, naringenin, and wogonin could be the main active ingredients of Chinese medicines for the management of COVID-19 by targeting on AEC2 and 3CL protein and inhibiting inflammatory mediators, regulating immunity, and eliminating free radicals through COX-2, CASP3, IL-6, MAPK1, MAPK14, MAPK8, and REAL in the signaling pathways of IL-17, arachidonic acid, HIF-1, NF-κB, Ras, and TNF. This study may provide meaningful and useful information on further research to investigate the action mechanisms of Chinese medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide a basis for sharing the "China scheme" for COVID-19 treatment.
74b7bc01be5321e9e80ec35cba0bb9b3b3293e9a	Objective Compare rates of initial extubation success in preterm infants extubated to NIPPV or NI-NAVA. Study design In this pilot study, we randomized 30 mechanically ventilated preterm infants at the time of initial elective extubation to NI-NAVA or NIPPV in a 1:1 assignment. Primary study outcome was initial extubation success. Results Rates of continuous extubation for 120 h were 92% in the NI-NAVA group and 69% in the NIPPV group (12/13 vs. 9/13, respectively, p = 0.14). Infants extubated to NI-NAVA remained extubated longer (median 18 vs. 4 days, p = 0.02) and experienced lower peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) than infants managed with NIPPV throughout the first 3 days after extubation. Survival analysis through 14 days post extubation showed a sustained difference in the primary study outcome until 12 days post extubation. Conclusions Our study is the first to suggest that a strategy of extubating preterm infants to NI-NAVA may be more successful.
a5d41731f93410cad241d58545a8034123cca834	The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 2 December 2019 raised global health concerns. The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease 3 (3CL pro ) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CL pro is a 4 proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 5 (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies 6 revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. 7 Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CL pro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and 8 screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral 9 phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top 10 nine hits might serve as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and 11 drug development process to combat COVID-19. 12
52662ce54ce7eec49dce4d7c0592075227729f3e	Since its emergence in the 1990s, White Spot Disease (WSD) has had major economic and societal impact in the crustacean aquaculture sector. Over the years shrimp farming alone has experienced billion dollar losses through WSD. The disease is caused by the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), a large dsDNA virus and the only member of the Nimaviridae family. Susceptibility to WSSV in a wide range of crustacean hosts makes it a major risk factor in the translocation of live animals and in commodity products. Currently there are no effective treatments for this disease. Understanding the molecular basis of disease processes has contributed significantly to the treatment of many human and animal pathogens, and with a similar aim considerable efforts have been directed towards understanding host-pathogen molecular interactions for WSD. Work on the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in aquatic crustaceans has been restricted by a lack of sequenced and annotated genomes for host species. Nevertheless, some of the key host-pathogen interactions have been established: between viral envelope proteins and host cell receptors at initiation of infection, involvement of various immune system pathways in response to WSSV, and the roles of various host and virus miRNAs in mitigation or progression of disease. Despite these advances, many fundamental knowledge gaps remain; for example, the roles of the majority of WSSV proteins are still unknown. In this review we assess current knowledge of how WSSV infects and replicates in its host, and critique strategies for WSD treatment.
b1f2eaa0378bcadc93740305fb7aca7f93fb6ed1	Expiratory fl ow limitation (EFL) during tidal breathing is associated with chronic exertional dyspnoea in COPD. Respiratory system reactance (Xrs) measured by the forced oscillation technique (FOT) can be used to detect EFL with 100% sensitivity and 100% specifi city against gold standard measures (Dellaca et al. ERJ 2004). The validation study used a 5 Hz monofrequency oscillation signal. It is unknown whether multifrequency signals are comparable to 5 Hz in detecting EFL. Aim To determine if FOT multifrequency signals of 6, 11, 19 Hz and 5, 11, 19 Hz are comparable to 5 Hz in the detection of EFL in COPD patients. Methods 25 subjects with greater than 10 pack years smoking history and a clinical history of COPD underwent FOT during 60 seconds of tidal breathing, using 5 Hz, 5, 11, 19 Hz, and 6, 11, 19 Hz oscillation signals in random order. The difference between mean inspiratory and expiratory respiratory system reactance (ΔXrs) was calculated. Subjects had EFL if the mean ΔXrs was ≥2.8 cm H2O.s.l −1 at 5 Hz. Results Mean FEV 1 % predicted was 76 (range: 31-125) 7 subjects had EFL on 5 Hz, and of these 6 subjects had EFL on 5, 11, 19 Hz, and 6 subjects had EFL on 6, 11, 19 Hz. Five subjects had EFL on all 3 frequencies tested. Both multifrequency signals had sensitivity 85% and specifi city of 94% compared to 5 Hz. There was no signifi cant difference in ΔXrs between the three oscillation signals (ANOVA p = 0.18). Conclusions There was a high degree of concordance between the three oscillation signals used to assess EFL in this study. This study supports the use of multifrequency oscillation signals for the detection of EFL. Support S Mahadev -Asthma Foundation NSW stipend. Mannitol has been increasingly used as a challenge test for asthma and exercise-induced asthma in children. As an osmotic agent, it provides an objective measure of airway hyperreactivity. Aim To assess the frequency of positive mannitol tests in children who were referred with a history of asthma symptoms. Method Retrospective chart review of children aged 6 to 18 years who were referred for a mannitol challenge tests in the past 2 years with a history of 'asthma symptoms'. 'Asthma symptoms' was defi ned as parent reported wheeze or shortness of breath on exercise suggestive of EIA. Results We identifi ed a total of 80 patients who performed mannitol tests. Eleven patients had positive test (13.7%). Of these, seven (63.6%) had an atopic background and four (36.3%) were already being treated with inhaled corticosteroids prior to the test. Of the 69 children with negative mannitol tests, 20 (29%) were being treated with inhaled corticosteroids and 15 (21.7%) were atopic. Mean predicted FEV 1 was (108.1, ± 16 SD), mean percentage of FEV 1 drop (14.5, ± 3.5 SD). Twenty of the patients with negative mannitol tests had exercise tests. The exercise tests demonstrated reduced physical fi tness as the cause of reduced exercise ability. Conclusion This chart review suggests that a history of asthma symptoms does not equate with a positive mannitol challenge test. There are other causes of 'asthma symptoms' that can be defi ned further with exercise testing. Further data collection and statistical analysis are in process. Objective (1) To compare the airway responsiveness assessed using a mannitol inhalation challenge (MAN) and a methacholine inhalation challenge (METH) and to evaluate their respective correlation with airway infl ammation in subjects with previously diagnosed occupational asthma (OA). (2) To compare the sputum cell counts and the quality of the sputum sample obtained after inhalation of hypertonic saline and after MAN. Methods Subjects completed a MAN and a METH 2-7 days apart, in a random order. A sputum sample was obtained after inhalation of hypertonic saline following the METH or during the MAN. MAN was considered positive if the cumulative dose of mannitol inducing a 15% fall in FEV 1 (PD15) was ≤635 mg; a METH was considered positive if the dose of methacholine inducing a 20% fall in FEV 1 (PC 20 ) was ≤16 mg/mL. Airway responsiveness was also expressed as the dose response slope of METH (DRSMETH) or MAN (DRSMAN) for all subjects. Results Twenty-two subjects with OA were enrolled. METH identifi ed airway hyperresponsiveness in 68.2% of cases, MAN in 40.9% of cases; p = 0.01. DRSMETH and DRSMAN were signifi cantly correlated (r = 0.7 p < 0.001). Sputum eosinophils were correlated with DRS MAN (rho = 0.5; p = 0.009), but not with DRSMETH (rho = 0.2, p = 0.5). The quality of the sputum samples obtained after hypertonic saline or MAN was similar. Conclusions MAN may represent an interesting alternative to METH in measuring airway responsiveness and inducing sputum during the same procedure. Introduction Spirometry is often measured in epidemiological studies of young children, where ATS guidelines may be diffi cult to achieve. Aim To assess the value of spirometry among 6-year-old NZ children. Methods Spirometry was performed to ATS guidelines using a Vitalograph Pneumotrac 6800 and repeated after 15 minutes following bronchodilator (BD). The start and end of test curves were graded according to modifi ed ATS/ERS criteria 2007. We examined the ability of various spirometric measures to predict asthma by the acceptability of the test. Results 801 children performed spirometry. Five hundred fi fty-seven (69.5%) children satisfi ed the start of test criteria, and 484 (60.4%) satisfi ed the end of test criteria in one or more tests. FEV 1 , FVC and % predicted FEV 1 were signifi cantly lower in those not meeting the acceptability criteria. However, the prediction of current asthma by bronchodilator response (≥12% increase FEV 1 ) was similar for the whole population OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.3-3.3) and those with ≥1 acceptable test OR 2.3 (CI 2.0-4.3). Conclusion While individual tests that do not meet current criteria are signifi cantly lower than those that do, at a population level acceptability makes little difference to the prediction of asthma.
f186944f45fec6916b431f95cb84275037b6d717	The CD147 receptor plays an integral role in numerous diseases by stimulating the expression of several protein families and serving as the receptor for extracellular cyclophilins; however, neither CD147 nor its interactions with its cyclophilin ligands have been well characterized in solution. CD147 is a unique protein in that it can function both at the cell membrane and after being released from cells where it continues to retain activity. Thus, the CD147 receptor functions through at least two mechanisms that include both cyclophilin-independent and cyclophilindependent modes of action. In regard to CD147 cyclophilin-independent activity, CD147 homophilic interactions are thought to underlie its activity. In regard to CD147 cyclophilin-dependent activity, cyclophilin/CD147 interactions may represent a novel means of signaling since cyclophilins are also peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. However, direct evidence of catalysis has not been shown within the cyclophilin/CD147 complex. In this report, we have characterized the solution behavior of the two most prevalent CD147 extracellular isoforms through biochemical methods that include gelfiltration and native gel analysis as well as directly through multiple NMR methods. All methods indicate that the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains are monomeric in solution and, thus, suggest that CD147 homophilic interactions in vivo are mediated through other partners. Additionally, using multiple NMR techniques, we have identified and characterized the cyclophilin target site on CD147 and have shown for the first time that CD147 is also a substrate of its primary cyclophilin enzyme ligand, cyclophilin A.
74f4420a1e9886831ef32c236be81ed044c51869	Objective: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis in childhood; its etiology is unknown. The possibility that KD is an infectious disease has been discussed and investigated for decades, in light of the implication that infections are involved in the pathogenesis of KD. Young children rely on their innate immune system for protection against virus and micro-organisms. Human mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a C-type serum lectin synthesized by the liver as an acute phase protein and it plays an important role in the innate immune system. Here, we investigate the relationship between the MBL gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of KD in the Japanese population. Method: The frequencies of the genotypes, defined as mutations in codons 52, 54 and 57, and the functional promoter variants of the MBL were determined in 45 patients with KD. Results: The MBL codon-54 polymorphism frequency of heterozygote (GGC/GAC) and promoter variants were significantly higher in the KD group than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Neither group showed codon 52 nor 57 polymorphisms. Conclusion: It is possible that mutations of the MBL gene might be related to the trigger of the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease.
700558e4e630211dbcc8d6cfe73ee58674e5661a	The pandemic has affected every aspect of myeloma care. Immediate focus is minimizing risk of contracting COVID-19 and the sequelae of infection. However, what does the future hold for our patients? What lessons will be taken forward to tackle myeloma in the fiscally constrained future? If we embrace the challenges that will emerge in the post-pandemic environment, the treatment delivered to patients could be more cost effective and better tailored than before. Healthcare delivery post-COVID will not return to how it was, and now is the time to invest in novel strategies to deliver the best possible outcomes for patients.
b8cdf1db199cdfbe969bd4d180b2b35048dba3c4	A method was developed for the detection and quantitation of HAdV (human adenovirus) and HBoV (human bocavirus) based on a duplex real-time PCR, the AB PCR, using a Smartcycler instrument. A control real-time PCR was carried out on albumin DNA to standardise the non-homogenous respiratory samples. No cross-reactivity was observed with viruses or bacteria that could be found in the respiratory tract. The diagnosis rate using the AB PCR on clinical samples was 10.7%: 3.4% for HBoV detection, 6.9% for HAdV detection and 0.3% double detection HBoV-HAdV. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the HAdV-and HBoV-infected patients were evaluated. In the HAdV-positive group and the HBoVpositive group the samples were classified according to the severity of the disease. The HAdV viral load did not appear to be linked to the severity of the disease. Conversely, the difference between the two HBoV groups, severe and non-severe, was significant statistically when the comparison was based on the viral load (P = 0.006) or after adjustment of the viral load to the number of cells in the samples (P = 0.02).
fab52c2936689728b0302a3831712cde074a0652	SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family of coronaviruses. The first cases were recorded in Wuhan, China, between December 2019 and January 2020. Italy is one of the most affected countries in Europe. COVID-19 is a new challenge in modern dentistry. New guidelines are required in dental clinics to avoid contagion caused by cross-infections. A narrative review was performed using both primary sources, such as scientific articles and secondary ones, such as bibliographic indexes, web pages, and databases. The main search engines were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. Twelve articles were selected to develop the bibliographic review by applying pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Precautionary measures should be applied to control COVID-19 in clinical practice. Several authors have highlighted the importance of telephone triage and/or clinic questionnaires, body temperature measurement, usage of personal protective equipment, surface disinfection with ethanol between 62% and 71%, high-speed instruments equipped with an anti-retraction system, four-handed work, and large-volume cannulas for aspiration. Clinically, the use of a rubber dam is essential. FFP2 (or N95) and FFP3 respirators, if compared to surgical masks, provide greater protection for health workers against viral respiratory infections. Further accurate studies are needed to confirm this.
5af9c3bce43b90c81887d5102c0e5c114d40f5dc	A new human betacoronavirus in lineage c, tentatively called HCoV-EMC, was isolated from a patient from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who died from acute severe pneumonia and renal failure. The viral RNA has been detected in eight additional cases. Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the viral genomic RNA showed that it is a novel virus not previously detected in any other species and that its closest relatives are two Asian bat coronaviruses. HCoV-EMC may represent a sporadic spillover to humans from an unknown animal reservoir. In a recent article, van Boheemen et al. demonstrated how state-of-theart sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis can quickly provide critical insight into the viral genome sequence, phylogeny, replication strategy, and potential drug and vaccine targets and generate tools to evaluate the possible epidemic risk associated with this novel human virus.

056d58cd0b7442359aa82b8f6bca98b16b00e4fb	It is possible to interfere with different steps in the dolichol pathway of protein glycosylation and in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Thus some clues about the role of protein-bound carbohydrate can be obtained by comparing the biochemical fates and functions of glycosylated proteins with their non-glycosylated counterparts, or with proteins exhibiting differences in the type of oligosaccharide side chains. Cells infected with enveloped viruses are good systems for studying both aspects of protein glycosylation, since they contain a limited number of different glycoproteins, often with well-defined functions. Tunicamycin, an antibiotic, as well as several sugar analogues have been found to act as inhibitors of protein glycosylation by virtue of their anti-viral properties. They interfere with various steps in the dolichol pathway resulting in a lack of functional lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursors. Compounds that interfere with oligosaccharide trimming represent a second generation o.f inhibitors of glycosylation. They are glycosidase inhibitors that interfere with the processing glucosidases and mannosidases and, as a resulL the conversion of high-mannose into complex-type oligosaccharides is blocked. Depending upon the compound used, glycoproteins contain glucosylated-high-mannose, highmannose or hybrid oligosaccharide structures instead of complex ones. The biglogical consequences of the alterations caused by the inhibitors are manifold: increased susceptibility to proteases, improper protein processing and misfolding of polypeptide chains, loss of biological activity and alteration of the site of virus-budding, to name but a few. protein glycosylation / oligosaccharide trimming / inhibition / viral glycoproteins
a23739aba0ae99bdf7e687731f4c61770cb6569d	Background Viral respiratory infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Many new aetiological agents have been described recently. Objectives We looked for respiratory viruses in a populationbased sample of healthy adults with influenza-like illness (ILI). We investigated host and spatio-temporal associations with virus isolation and host, spatio-temporal and virus associations with self-reported symptoms. Patients ⁄ Methods We recruited 586 participants experiencing 651 illness episodes from a population of healthy adults enrolled in an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. At ILI assessment visits, a respiratory swab was collected and tested for viruses using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Participants also completed a questionnaire detailing their clinical course in 336 episodes. Of 643 samples analysed, a virus was identified in 44%. Half were picornaviruses, with influenza and coronaviruses the Conclusions Our findings indicate that a greater number of symptoms are displayed by individuals presenting with influenza confirmed ILI compared with other agents that cause ILI. While influenza vaccination reduced the probability of influenza virus detection, symptom score for influenza-positive ILI was not attenuated. Please cite this paper as: Howard et al.

6f6ccfdab548a075188f8c6e5d38b7f6d9044f2e	In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are vital signs (VS) that are continuously monitored in infants, while blood pressure is often monitored continuously immediately after birth, or during critical illness. Although changes in VS can reflect infant physiology or circadian rhythms, persistent deviations in absolute values or complex changes in variability, can indicate acute or chronic pathology. Recent studies demonstrate that analysis of continuous VS trends can predict sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cardiorespiratory decompensation, and mortality. Subtle changes in continuous VS patterns may not be discerned even by experienced clinicians reviewing spot VS data or VS trends captured in the monitor. In contrast, objective analysis of continuous VS data can improve neonatal outcomes by allowing heightened vigilance or preemptive interventions. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that have used continuous analysis of single or multiple VS, their interactions, and combined VS and clinical analytic tools, to predict or detect neonatal pathophysiology. We make the case that big-data analytics are promising, and with continued improvements, can become a powerful tool to mitigate neonatal diseases in the 21 st century. We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL from 1990 to March 2019. Select studies were included in which continuous VS data on heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and/or blood pressure were captured and analyzed in neonates during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit, for any period of time. Outcomes of interest were analytics of VS physiologic variability, comparisons between continuous and interval VS measurements, and associations with short-term or long-term clinical outcomes. Physiologic determinants of heart rate monitoring-HR is continuously monitored from birth until discharge for all NICU infants. The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is obtained from three electrodes, two on the chest and one on the abdomen, and the bedside monitor displays one lead of ECG. HR can be calculated from the inter-beat interval (R to R wave of the QRS complexes), and in most NICU monitors the numerical HR displayed represents a moving average of several QRS complexes. Pulse rate (PR) calculated from the pulse oximetry signal is also continuously displayed. A significant discrepancy between the pulse oximetry-derived PR and the ECG-derived HR often indicates poor pulse oximetry signal quality, and therefore, the HR is generally more reliable than the PR (13). Normative data on HR in preterm NICU patients have recently been published (14). Using HRV patterns to detect disease-HR variability (HRV), or normal beat to beat fluctuations in HR, is regulated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems (15). In healthy preterm infants, HR accelerations and decelerations reflect high variability and are indicative of a functioning, adaptable autonomic nervous system, while decreased HRV suggests a stressed or pathological state.

5d30cb639c466d357386c07855e7d7d480552c9e	The lung is a key target of the cytokine storm that can be triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the widespread clinical syndrome known as coronavirus disease 2019 . Indeed, in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 promotes a dysfunctional immune response that dysregulates the cytokine secretory pattern. Hypercytokinemia underlies the hyperinflammatory state leading to injury of alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, as well as to lung infiltration sustained by neutrophils and macrophages. Within such a pathogenic context, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other cytokines/chemokines play a pivotal pro-inflammatory role. Therefore, cytokines and their receptors, as well as cytokine-dependent intracellular signalling pathways can be targeted by potential therapies aimed to relieve the heavy burden of cytokine storm. In particular, the anti-IL-6-receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab is emerging as one of the most promising pharmacologic treatments. The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.
d1796a5151b157cf6b477db9417bccc4ea125ed0	Decontamination of objects and surfaces can limit transmission of infectious agents via fomites or biological samples. It is required for the safe re-use of potentially contaminated personal protective equipment and medical and laboratory equipment. Heat treatment is widely used for the inactivation of various infectious agents, notably viruses. We show that for liquid specimens (here suspension of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture medium), virus inactivation rate under heat treatment at 70 • C can vary by almost two orders of magnitude depending on the treatment procedure, from a half-life of 0.86 min (95% credible interval: [0.09, 1.77]) in closed vials in a heat block to 37.0 min ([12.65, 869.82]) in uncovered plates in a dry oven. These findings suggest a critical role of evaporation in virus inactivation using dry heat. Placing samples in open or uncovered containers may dramatically reduce the speed and efficacy of heat treatment for virus inactivation. Heating procedures must be carefully specified when reporting experimental studies to facilitate result interpretation and reproducibility, and carefully considered when designing decontamination guidelines.

4d6f4d2c562e7017500b6800003dcf08e723c9d5	To the Editor: Iatrogenic burn injuries are rarely reported in neonates. A 3-d-old neonate with meconium aspiration syndrome was being mechanically ventilated in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). His diaper was kept open as he had perineal rash. Dry gauze pads were placed under buttocks to provide a soft surface. During an episode of desaturation, endotracheal suctioning was performed. After the procedure was over, while changing the diaper, the care-giving nurse suddenly noticed that the gauze pads and diaper have caught flames. Though she immediately threw away the burning materials, the infant sustained first-to-second degree burns over the buttocks and posterior surface of thighs. Burn management was started immediately in consultation with plastic surgeons. Event investigation by electrical and bio-medical engineers found that the radiant warmer and other equipment attached with the infant (ventilator, syringe pumps, multi-para monitor) were undamaged and fully functional. The electrical circuits of NICU were also intact. Incident analysis revealed that after suctioning, oxygen tube used to provide free-flow oxygen during suctioning was left open. The nurse rubbed her hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) before and after suctioning. Friction of hand-rubbing and subsequent touching of polyethylene surface of diaper probably generated static electricity by triboelectric effect [1]. The prerequisites for fire i.e., an ignition source (electrostatic discharge), fuel (alcohol vapors) and oxygen, probably resulted in fire accident with combustion of gauze pads and diaper. Previous reports linked ABHR with fire-accidents in operation-theatres using electrocautery [2] . In healthcare set-ups, fire-accidents triggered by high voltage electrostatic discharge generated by routine activities such as hand-rubbing while wearing polyester gowns, have been reported [3, 4] . Ringing of mobile phone while handling the car fuel-tank has also been associated with accidental fire-incident [5] . Mobile phone was not present near the place of fire-accident in our case. We speculate that avoidance of hand-rubbing using ABHR under the warmer, complete drying of hands before touching any polyethylene/polyester/metal surface and closure of oxygen supply immediately after use can avoid such an incident. The neonate made complete recovery and was discharged.
a895411134bdd82a7f0333ef01128dc836da42f8	This review summarizes the current view of amino acid transport by epithelial cells of vertebrates. A wide variety of transporter proteins are expressed in apical and basolateral membranes and collectively play complex interactive roles in controlling the entire organism's overall metabolism of amino acids. Regulation of the transport systems can be manifested at many levels, including gene splicing and promoter regulation, interactions between requisite subunits of oligomers, thermodynamic electrochemical gradients contributed by ion exchangers, overlap of substrate specificity, selective tissue distribution, and specific spatial distribution of transporters leading to net vectorial flow of the amino acids. The next frontier for workers in this field is to uncover a comprehensive molecular understanding of the manner by which epithelial cells signal gene expression of transporters as triggered by substrates, hormones or other triggers, in order to further understand the trafficking and interactions among multimeric transport system proteins, to extend discoveries of novel small drug substrates for oral and ocular delivery, and to examine gene therapy or nanotherapy of diseases using small molecules delivered via amino acid transporters.
38f795b33ce33a4cdc53ea8522aeb30a948c1f70	SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and has been declared as pandemic disease by World Health Organization. Lack of targeted therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-2019 have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or drugs against this novel virus. Many synthetic compounds and antimalarial drugs are undergoing clinical trials. The traditional medical practitioners widely use Indian medicinal plant Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) natural constituents, called withanolides for curing various diseases. The main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in disease propagation by processing the polyproteins which are required for its replication. Hence, it denotes a significant target for drug discovery. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of 40 natural chemical constituents of Ashwagandha to explore a possible inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by adopting the computational approach. The docking study revealed that four constituents of Ashwagandha; Withanoside II (-11.30 Kcal/mol), Withanoside IV (-11.02 Kcal/mol), Withanoside V (-8.96 Kcal/mol) and Sitoindoside IX (-8.37 Kcal/mol) exhibited the highest docking energy among the selected natural constituents. Further, MD simulation study of 100 ns predicts Withanoside V possess strong binding affinity and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and indicates its stability in the active site. The binding free energy score also correlates with the highest score of À87.01 ± 5.01 Kcal/mol as compared to other selected compounds. In conclusion, our study suggests that Withanoside V in Ashwagandha may be serve as a potential inhibitor against M pro of SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 and may have an antiviral effect on nCoV. ARTICLE HISTORY
6ab3418ea99795f020c812cc1fc298118c929119	This paper investigates how expansionary monetary policy after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has affected the U.S. banking sector. In response to the GFC, the Federal Reserve first lowered the overnight federal funds rate from 5.25% in August 2007 to zero in December 2008. It then turned to quantitative easing, purchasing housing agency debt, mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury bonds to stimulate the economy. While these policies helped the overall economy to recover, they may have harmed the banking sector. Banks accept safe short-term deposits and transform these into risky longer-term loans. They make a profit on the difference between the interest rate they earn on longer-term assets and the rate they pay of short-term deposits (the net interest margin). Low short-term interest rates and compressed spreads between long-and short-term interest rates may impair bank profitability. Bernanke and Gertler (J Econ Perspect 4:27-48, 1995) showed that reduced bank profitability can hinder their ability to extend loans. Bernanke (FRBNY Q Rev 18:50-70, 1993) noted that this is problematic because banks play a special role in channeling savings to promising borrowers. Financial markets are plagued by information imperfections. Savers release funds today for the promise of obtaining funds later. Whether they get repaid depends on the character of the borrower, the quality of the investment, the collateral that the borrower can provide, and other factors. The lender needs to consider these items and not just interest rates. Asymmetric information can thus hinder the flow of funds from savers to small businesses and other borrowers whose quality is hard to evaluate. Banks can bridge imperfect information problems because they have a comparative advantage because of the following reasons: (1) economies of specialization, as lending officers gain expertise in a particular industry; (2) economies of scale, as it is cheaper for bank to evaluate a loan than for small savers to; and (3) economies of scope, as it is cheaper to provide lending services together with other services. This paper investigates how lower short-term rates and falls in the spread between long-and short-term rates affect bank profitability. To do this, it investigates how these variables affect bank stock prices. Stock prices provide valuable information since they are the expected present value of future cash flows. The results indicate that falls in short rates and Non-Traditional Monetary Policies and Their Effects
b0cae19606cad103f0faadf98436fcbdbf95282e	This paper presents a theoretical research about the relationship between weak negations and adjoint negations. Adjoint negations are a generalization of residuated negations built from the implications of an adjoint triple. Specifically, this work shows how to build adjoint triples on the unit interval such that their adjoint negations coincide with a given weak negation. Moreover, the algebraic structure formed by these adjoint triples is also investigated.
9b0256aeaf1b764c83c22c46f726e9def3b5c265	With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 , people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference (p = 0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference (p = 0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors:
57917e0b169f8378708d74f4e3bfa47334416818	Macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MR-MP) is an increasing problem worldwide. This study describes the clonal spread of a unique strain of MR-MP within a single family. On January 23, 2015, nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from the index case (a 9-year-old girl) in southern Italy. The patient had pneumonia and was initially treated with clarithromycin. MR-MP infection was suspected due to prolonged symptoms despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Two further cases of pneumonia occurred in relatives (a 7-year-old cousin and the 36-year-old mother of the index case); therefore, respiratory samples were also collected from other family members. Sequence analysis identified mutations associated with resistance to macrolides. Both P1 major adhesion protein typing and multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing were performed to assess the relatedness of the strains. The index case, the cousin, the mother, and another 4 family members (twin siblings of the index case, a 3-year-old cousin, and the grandmother) were positive for MR-MP. All strains harbored the mutation A2063G, had the same P1 subtype (1), and were MLVA (7/4/ 5/7/2) type Z. In addition, the index case's aunt (31 years of age and the probable source of infection) harbored an M pneumoniae strain with the same molecular profile; however, this strain was susceptible to macrolides. This cluster of MR-MP infection/carriage caused by a clonal strain suggests a high transmission rate within this family and highlights the need for increased awareness among clinicians regarding the circulation of MR-MP. Novel strategies for the treatment and prevention of M pneumoniae infections are required. (Medicine 95(11):e3160) Abbreviations: MLVA = multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis, MR-MP = macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae, NPS = nasopharyngeal swab, PCR = polymerase chain reaction.

a85d0ba34058935c75d091c18bf04765a08c209d	Differentiating foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) antibodies generated during a natural infection from those due to vaccination (DIVA) is crucial for proving freedom from disease after an outbreak and allowing resumption of trade in livestock products. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) recommends that FMDV vaccines are composed of inactivated virus that has been purified to remove non-structural viral proteins. Such purified vaccines primarily induce antibodies to viral structural proteins, whereas replicating virus stimulates host antibodies specific for both structural and non-structural proteins. The current preferred FMDV DIVA test is a competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) designed to detect antibodies to the non-structural protein 3ABC. Previously, we described the development of an FMDV DIVA test based entirely on recombinant proteins (the recombinant detecting antibody and the 3ABC coating antigen) produced in Escherichia coli. In this study, we have determined the precise binding site of the recombinant detecting antibody to a conserved sequence within the 3B region of the 3ABC protein, replaced the original E-tag of the detecting antibody with two in-house tags and engineered a direct antibody-reporting enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) fusion protein. These modifications have further improved the DIVA test, providing great potential for large scale production and uptake due to its simplicity, reproducibility and low cost.
be6016e1039e39d4777e35acfd8a31c13bc86e77	The ongoing spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a significant threat to global health. As the coronavirus outbreak began spreading, hospitals were forced to relocate resources to treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients. As a consequence, doctors across the country canceled tens of thousands of nonurgent surgeries. However, recognizing that the COVID-19 situation may be highly variable and fluid in different communities across the country, elective surgery could be still allowed in some centers for patients included in the high-priority class. The majority of endocrine disorders requiring surgical treatment in patients identifiable as first-priority class, or needing hospitalization within 30 days, are generally represented by malignant thyroid tumors, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and some adrenal disorders. The need for urgent intervention is evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the severity of the symptoms, the likelihood of progression, and global clinical judgment. On the basis of the above indications, during the last 4 weeks, we performed 18 planned surgical treatments in patients with thyroid cancer (total thyroidectomies, plus lymph node dissection if needed) or multinodular toxic goiter. In no case, postoperative ventilatory support was needed, and the average hospital stay was 3 days. The negative COVID-19 status for all the treated patients was appropriately evaluated beforehand. Nobody knows how long the current COVID-19 pandemic will be lasting. Certainly, we will be requested in the next future to incrementally offer surgical services for endocrine disorders that have been deferred for the COVID-19 pandemic.
7b214559853be4aef55becd8006df487d5312f0c	Mechanical circulatory support has been performed as a bridge to cardiac retransplantation in selected patients with graft failure. However, there is limited published experience on the use and potential benefit of the total artificial heart (TAH) as a bridge to cardiac retransplantation. We report on our institutional experience with 3 patients that received TAH as a bridge to retransplant, with 1 patient surviving postretransplantation. This case series demonstrates the high-risk nature of this undertaking in cardiac retransplant candidates and highlights the issue of sensitization portending greater risk for poor outcomes after TAH as bridge to retransplantation.

dd50cda69b19bd12849212e13e3a959415fdef62	In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, the capital of the Chinese province Hubei. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for a worldwide pandemic resulting in over 4 million infections and over 250,000 deaths. The pandemic has instigated widespread research related to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease that it causes, COVID-19. Research into this new virus will be facilitated by the availability of clearly described and effective procedures that enable the propagation and quantification of infectious virus. As work with the virus is recommended to be performed at biosafety level 3, validated methods to effectively inactivate the virus to enable the safe study of RNA, DNA, and protein from infected cells are also needed. Here, we report methods used to grow SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cell lines and to measure virus infectivity by plaque assay using either agarose or microcrystalline cellulose as an overlay as well as a SARS-CoV-2 specific focus forming assay. We also demonstrate effective inactivation by TRIzol, 10% neutral buffered formalin, beta propiolactone, and heat.
6bb0038a55ff68a2f47a36e8c845126da7fea61b	Cadmium is an environmentally hazardous metal, which causes toxicity in humans. Inhalation of cigarette smoke and industrial fumes containing cadmium are sources of cadmium exposure. It is responsible for the malfunction of various organs, leading to disease particularly in the lungs, liver and kidneys. In the present study, the effect of cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 ) on cell viability, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-10 cytokines at various concentrations and incubation durations were assessed in MRC-9 human normal lung and A549 human lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. Cell viability was measured using a crystal violet dye binding assay. The expression levels of the cytokines were measured by cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl 2 compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl 2 concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl 2 concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium. The results indicated that CdCl 2 affected the expression levels of the cytokines and led to cytotoxicity in human lung cells, and suggested that compounds which reduce inflammation may prevent cadmium toxicity.

A number of reports have demonstrated that CyPA plays a critical role in the successful replication of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), etc. However, recent studies demonstrated that CyPA also possesses a repressive effect on the replication of some viruses like Influenza A virus and rotavirus. Moreover, CyPA could also regulate host IFN-I response to viral infections. Together, these evidences showed diverse roles of CyPA in viral infection.
0b3a1e6c8aac53f3ff29a7c05c503755eb349370	COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a huge concern to the global population due to its highly contagious properties. The SARS-CoV-2 is a new variant in the coronavirus family. The world is focussing on several methods to battle against this novel corona virus, including control of its spread. In this context, ARCI has quickly made efforts to develop disinfection systems including a UVC-based disinfection trolley, honeycomb air heater and a fogging chamber using UVC germicidal lamps, dry heat sterilization and HOCl-based chemical disinfectant to provide rapid and effective inactivation of microorganisms causing the pandemic. These systems have been successfully deployed at different hospitals for their validation.
49f01042ee1df642748c8b65f2abde687b2750ed	Oxidative stress is considered as a major risk factor that contributes to increased lipid peroxidation and declined antioxidants in some degenerative diseases. Glycyrrhizin is widely used to cure allergic diseases due to its medicinal properties. In the present study, we evaluated the role of glycyrrhizin on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in the blood and nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis (AR) mice. Mice were divided into six groups: normal control mice, model control (MC) mice, three glycyrrhizin-treated mice groups and lycopene-treated mice. Sensitization-associated increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in the blood and nasal mucosa of MC mice. Activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) and levels of glutathione (GSH) were found to be significantly decreased in the blood and nasal mucosa in MC mice when compared to normal control mice. However, normalized lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defenses were reported in the glycyrrhizin-treated and lycopene-treated mice. Moreover, glycyrrhizin treatment still enhanced IFN-γ and reduced IL-4 levels in glycyrrhizin-treated mice. These findings demonstrated that glycyrrhizin treatment enhanced the antioxidant status and Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12 906 decreased the incidence of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation and improved immunity activities in the blood and nasal mucosa of AR mice.
14e484e6f48dcc492ccad50691b90b4d14b6893e	We sought to identify optimal temporal windows for lockdown-based mitigation strategies on infectious disease spreads. An age-structured multi-compartmental Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model was used to estimate infection spreads under parametric variation of lockdown intensity and duration from the data of SARS-CoV2 cases in India between January to July, 2020. The resulting parameter values were used to simulate lockdown outcomes for a wide range of start times and durations. Lockdowns were simulated as intervention strategies that modified weights assigned to social contact matrices for work, school and other places. Lockdown efficacy was assessed by the maximum number of infections recorded during a simulation run. Our analysis shows that lockdown outcomes depend sensitively on the timing of imposition and that it is possible to minimize lockdown durations while limiting case loads to numbers below the hospitalization thresholds. Such timing based effects arise naturally from the non-linear nature of SIR dynamics.
f2ea977d83d5e946bd02e9e19ce88712891c7683	The economic and public health crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic is exposing existing inequalities between ethnic groups in England and Wales, as well as creating new ones. We draw on current mortality and case data, alongside pre-crisis labour force data to investigate the relative vulnerability of different ethnic groups to adverse health and economic impacts. After accounting for differences in population structure and regional concentration, we show that most minority groups have suffered excess mortality compared to the white British majority group. Differences in underlying health conditions such as diabetes may play a role; so too may occupational exposure to the virus, given the very different labour market profiles of ethnic groups. Distinctive patterns of occupational concentration also highlight the vulnerability of some groups to the economic consequences of social distancing measures, with Bangladeshi and Pakistani men particularly likely to be employed in occupations directly affected by the UK's 'lockdown'. We show that differences in household structures and inequalities in access to savings mean that a number of minority groups are also less likely to be able to weather short-term shocks to their income. Documenting these immediate consequences of the crisis reveals the potential for inequalities to become entrenched in the longer term. JEL codes: I14; J21; J15; J6
208982a3db63c37bcf489bbaa8d6e9ad2116f491	The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet knowledge of its biology is limited. Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 and cool weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in a population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, climate still may be important for predicting the future distribution of SARS-CoV-2. To further examine if there is a link, we model with raw cases and population scaled cases for SARS-CoV-2 county-level data from the United States. We show that SDMs built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models built from raw human population data, while SDMs built on raw data fail to predict the current known distribution of cases in the US. The population scaled analyses indicate that climate may not play a central role in current US viral distribution and that human population density is likely a primary driver. Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas. This coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the US SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 can spread anywhere in the US.

1ebf2746af842ad7998b3528bafabc2243a7d617	Thermoeconomic analysis, a combined application of thermodynamic and economic analyses, has emerged as an important tool to optimize the performance of desalination systems. Contrary to conventional economic analysis, it offers flexibility to investigate and improve the performance of each component in the system, individually. The current paper presents a comprehensive framework for conducting thermoeconomic analysis of desalination systems. In this regard, different energy calculation methods are discussed first. Then a detailed review of theoretical developments of thermoeconomic analyses is conducted to summarize the correlations/magnitude of important economic parameters. This is followed by a discussion on cost balance equations for important desalination components. Finally, a systematic thermoeconomic analysis model is developed for the mechanical vapor compression desalination system operating under different arrangements as an example. The monetary value of each stream calculated using appropriate fiscal parameters in the system is presented in the form of a cost flow diagram. The study can be used to conduct the thermoeconomic analysis of other commercial desalination systems. ⁎ Corresponding authors at: Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology, Rahim
589bf79968b1a789ccf883c74bf42c92c570212e	The graph structure of biomedical data differs from those in typical knowledge graph benchmark tasks. A particular property of biomedical data is the presence of long-range dependencies, which can be captured by patterns described as logical rules. We propose a novel method that combines these rules with a neural multi-hop reasoning approach that uses reinforcement learning. We conduct an empirical study based on the realworld task of drug repurposing by formulating this task as a link prediction problem. We apply our method to the biomedical knowledge graph Hetionet and show that our approach outperforms several baseline methods.
011d1548536b067db6422e7fcf9d5bfd87bb9250	Objective: This review aimed to identify proper respiratory-related sample types for adult and pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), respectively, by comparing performance of Xpert MTB/RIF when using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), induced sputum (IS), expectorated sputum (ES), nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), and gastric aspiration (GA) as sample. Methods: Articles were searched in Web of Science, PubMed, and Ovid from inception up to 29 June 2020. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated, each with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Quality assessment and heterogeneity evaluation across included studies were performed. Results: A total of 50 articles were included. The respective sensitivity and specificity were 87% (95% CI: 0.84-0.89), 91% (95% CI: 0.90-0.92) and 95% (95% CI: 0.93-0.97) in the adult BAL group; 90% (95% CI: 0.88-0.91), 98% (95% CI: 0.97-0.98) and 97% (95% CI: 0.95-0.99) in the adult ES group; 86% (95% CI: 0.84-0.89) and 97% (95% CI: 0.96-0.98) in the adult IS group. Xpert MTB/RIF showed the sensitivity and specificity of 14% (95% CI: 0.10-0.19) and 99% (95% CI: 0.97-1.00) in the pediatric ES group; 80% (95% CI: 0.72-0.87) and 94% (95% CI: 0.92-0.95) in the pediatric GA group; 67% (95% CI: 0.62-0.72) and 99% (95% CI: 0.98-0.99) in the pediatric IS group; and 54% (95% CI: 0.43-0.64) and 99% (95% CI: 0.97-0.99) in the pediatric NPA group. The heterogeneity across included studies was deemed acceptable. Conclusion: Considering diagnostic accuracy, cost and sampling process, ES was a better choice than other sample types for diagnosing adult PTB, especially HIV-associated PTB. GA might be more suitable than other sample types for diagnosing pediatric PTB. The actual choice of sample types should also consider the needs of specific situations. adverse reactions limit its application [16] . It is also worth noting that in clinical practice, bronchoscopy and lavage are not considered as feasible in young children due to the potential risk for anesthesia and need of specialized procedural expertise, unless otherwise specified [17] . NPA is sampled after stimulation of the cough reflex via inserting a small feeding catheter into the nasopharynx [18] . Low operational requirements, less invasive sampling, and ready access enable NPA to become an alternative to BAL for pediatric PTB, but not for adult PTB due to significantly different airway microbial composition between NPA and BAL [17] . Young children, particularly who under 5 years, are unable to expectorate sputum and always swallow sputum in their stomach by mistake, thus GA is collected by a nasogastric tube during night in three consecutive mornings to detect MTB for pediatric PTB [19, 20] . Nonetheless, MTB is less likely to be detected in GA than smear in adults, and therefore, and thus GA is not regarded as an option for detecting MTB for adult PTB [21] . Enough volume and consecutive samples of GA support repeat tests to improve the rate of detection [22] . Although there are many samples types to choose from, different samples vary greatly in cost, requirement for operators and operating environment, the degree of sampling invasiveness, quality, volume, and others. It is hard to assess which is the best choice for diagnosing PTB. In addition, few studies pay attention to assess the impact of different sample types on the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF when diagnosing PTB. Therefore, we undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the detection capacity of Xpert MTB/RIF when using ES, IS, and BAL as samples for diagnosing adult PTB, as well as ES, IS, GA, and NPA for diagnosing pediatric PTB. We aimed to summarize and curate reliable evidence for choosing the proper sample types to diagnose PTB patients at different ages.
6cf92076d00b7a66932bf3a5ec6794a70134a93c	The growth of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 on murine DBT cells adapted to dextran-made Cytodex 1 microcarriers was studied in comparison with cells grown on plastic dishes. With a microcarrier concentration of 5 g/l in spinner flasks, a density of 3 x lo6 cells/ml was reached in 7 days. Under these conditions, cells supported virus growth to the same extent as when they were grown on the plastic substratum. This was shown by a similar development of virus-induced syncytia, the release of an equivalent number of infectious progeny virions per cell, similar recoveries observed after concentration and purification and an identical appearance of the purified virus under the electron microscope. On the other hand, the technical convenience of microcarriers and the ease of scale-up emphasize their potential for the growth of coronaviruses.
b375a0aaad125a9931e918df472e270e23880e96	Serological assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are now of critical importance to support diagnosis, guide epidemiological intervention, and understand immune response to natural infection and vaccine administration. We developed and validated new anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA tests (ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a.) based on whole-virus antigens. We used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases, healthy donors, and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions. Overall, the assays showed good concordance with the indirect immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Especially for IgG and IgA, we observed high sensitivity (92.5 and 93.6%, respectively); specificity was high (>96%) for all antibody types ELISAs. In addition, sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset (DSO) due to the seroconversion window, and for ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review) : medRxiv preprint 2 ELISAs resulted 100% in those samples collected after 10 and 12 DSO, respectively. The results showed that ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs may represent a valid option for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, covering all different antibody types developed in SARS-CoV-2 immune response.
0aa9b35d67cc892c4b1597bf1e293999400e47d1	Background: Globally, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a new, highly contagious, and life-threatening virus. We aimed to demonstrate how we proceeded with bronchoscopic procedures without published guidelines at the inception of the pandemic period. Materials and Methods: All bronchoscopic procedures applied from the first case seen in Turkey (11 March-15 May) were evaluated retrospectively. Patient data on indications, diagnosis, types of procedures, and the results of COVID-19 tests were recorded. Results: This study included 126 patients; 36 required interventional bronchoscopic techniques (28.6%), 74 required endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS; 58.7%), and 16 required flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (12.7%). All interventional rigid bronchoscopic techniques were performed for emergent indications: malignant airway obstruction (66.7%), tracheal stenosis (25%), and bronchopleural fistula (8.3%). Malignancy was diagnosed in 59 (79.7%), 12 (50%), and 4 (25%) patients who underwent EBUS, interventional procedures, and fibreoptic bronchoscopy, respectively. All personnel wore personal protective equipment and patients wore a surgical mask, cap, and disposable gown. Of the patients, 31 (24.6%) were tested for
742859f3fa4a6cb4b82ecaf8fc4c91fb216568e5	Although the effective use of highly active antiretroviral therapy results in the suppression of virus production in infected individuals, it does not eliminate the infection and low level virus production in cells harboring virus in sanctuary sites. Thus, the continued search for new antiretroviral agents with unique and different mechanisms of HIV inhibition remains critical, and compounds that can reduce the level of virus production from cells already infected with HIV, as opposed to preventing de novo infection, would be of great benefit. A mercaptobenzamide (MDH-1-38) and its prodrug (NS1040) are being developed as potential therapeutic compounds targeting the zinc finger of HIV nucleocapsid. In the presence of esterase enzymes, NS1040 is designed to be converted to MDH-1-38 which has antiviral activity. While we presume that NS1040 is rapidly converted to MDH-1-38 in all experiments, the two compounds were tested side-by-side to determine whether the presence of a prodrug affects the antiviral activity or mechanism of action. The two compounds were evaluated against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates in human PBMCs and monocyte-macrophages and yielded EC 50 values ranging from 0.7 to 13 mM with no toxicity up to 100 mM. MDH-1-38 and NS1040 remained equally active in human PBMCs in the presence of added serum proteins as well as against HIV-1 isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase, integrase or protease inhibitors. Cell-based and biochemical mechanism of antiviral action assays demonstrated MDH-1-38 and NS1040 were virucidal at concentrations of 15 and 50 mM, respectively. Cell to cell transmission of HIV in multiple passages was significantly reduced in CEM-SS and human PBMCs by reducing progeny virus infectivity at compound concentrations greater than 2 mM. The combination of either MDH-1-38 or NS1040 with other FDA-approved HIV drugs yielded additive to synergistic antiviral interactions with no evidence of antiviral antagonism or synergistic toxicity. Serial dose escalation was used in attempts to select for HIV strains resistant to MDH-1-38 and NS1040. Virus at several passages failed to replicate in cells treated at increased compound concentrations, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of the virus inactivating compounds. Through 14 passages, resistance to the compounds has not been achieved. Most HIV inhibitors with mechanism of antiviral action targeting a viral protein would have selected for a drug resistant virus within 14 passages. These studies indicate that these NCp7-targeted compounds represent new potent anti-HIV drug candidates which could be effectively used in combination with all approved anti-HIV drugs.
3442b139e80c8351c89a9398709090db63edb8fe	The role of rodents in the transmission of many diseases is widely known. Wild rats abundant in urban environments may transmit diseases to humans and other animals, including laboratory rodents used for biomedical research in research facilities, possibly compromising research data. In order to gather information about the various diseases present around such facilities, it is important to conduct routine surveillance of wild rodents in the area. In this pilot study, we surveyed 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts for 19 microorganisms. Information gained from such surveillance data would be beneficial in assessing regional public health risks and when implementing routine laboratory rodent health monitoring protocols. Abstract: A pilot seroprevalence study was conducted to document exposure to selected pathogens in wild rats inhabiting the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Serum samples collected from 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) were tested for the presence of antibodies to various rodent pathogens using a rat MFI2 serology panel. The samples were positive for cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (13/22; 59.1%), Clostridium piliforme (4/22; 18.2%), Mycoplasma pulmonis (4/22; 18.2%), Pneumocystis carinii (1/22; 4.5%), mouse adenovirus type 2 (16/22; 72.7%), Kilham rat virus (15/22; 68.2%), reovirus type 3 (9/22; 40.9%), rat parvovirus (4/22; 18.2%), rat minute virus (4/22; 18.2%), rat theilovirus (2/22; 9.1%), and infectious diarrhea of infant rats strain of group B rotavirus (rat rotavirus) (1/22; 4.5%). This study provides the first evidence of exposure to various rodent pathogens in wild rats on the island of St. Kitts. Periodic pathogen surveillance in the wild rat population would be beneficial in assessing potential regional zoonotic risks as well as in enhancing the current knowledge when implementing routine animal health monitoring protocols in facilities with laboratory rodent colonies.
3ea46c230ece1d775154c4bb3e20376e2a43c2f9	We recently reported that anti-CD13 mAbs induce homotypic aggregation of monocytic cells. This phenomenon is signal transduction dependent and does not require CD13 aminopeptidase activity. Since CD13 is heavily glycosylated and a member of the galectin family (galectin-4) has been shown to associate with CD13 in the intestinal epithelium, we hypothesized that CD13-mediated aggregation might proceed through a carbohydrate-dependent mechanism involving galectin-3, the most highly expressed galectin on monocytes. We report here that lactose and anti-galectin-3 antibodies completely abrogate homotypic aggregation induced by anti-CD13 antibodies. Furthermore, galectin-3 co-immunoprecipitates with CD13 from resting U-937 cells and this association decreases during the aggregation process, a phenomenon that may have functional implications. Together, the results presented here point to a key role for galectin-3 in CD13-mediated homotypic aggregation of monocytic cells.
fb31c68dd599b62749352cd549729723140ece79	The most important features to assess the severity of an epidemic are its size and its timescale. We discuss these features in a systematic way in the context of SIR and SIR-type models. We investigate in detail how the size and timescale of the epidemic can be changed by acting on the parameters characterizing the model. Using these results and having as guideline the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, we compare the efficiency of different containment strategies for contrasting an epidemic diffusion such as social distancing, lockdown, tracing, early detection and isolation.

de207527ab4b8826e6e8901d63e768c19691b178	This article reviews the current epidemiology and clinical presentation of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and describes the preparedness plan of several countries. The MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and has since infected more than 1600 patients in 26 countries, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The epidemiology of the infection is compatible with multiple introductions of the virus into humans from an animal reservoir, probably dromedary camels. The clinical presentation ranges from no symptoms to severe pneumonitis and respiratory failure. Most confirmed cases so far were part of MERS-CoV clusters in hospital settings, affecting mainly middle-aged men and patients with a chronic disease or immuno-suppressed status. There is no vaccine or anti-viral medication available. Viral epidemics can occur anywhere in today's "global village". MERS-CoV is a relatively new virus, and this work is intended to add to the still-sparse data on its epidemiology, modes of transmission, natural history, and clinical features as well as to describe the preparedness plan for MERS-CoV infection in several countries. Effective national and international preparedness plans are essential to predict and control outbreaks, improve patient management, and ensure global health security.
f0a7684b84d874e9d61eee9c4cff37bb45bb2547	Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, β-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.
a0a5669b310ceb3840a599bf4f27a077a643d613	Framing is an indispensable narrative device for news media because even the same facts may lead to conflicting understandings if deliberate framing is employed. Therefore, identifying media framing is a crucial step to understanding how news media influence the public. Framing is, however, difficult to operationalize and detect, and thus traditional media framing studies had to rely on manual annotation, which is challenging to scale up to massive news datasets. Here, by developing a media frame classifier that achieves state-of-the-art performance, we systematically analyze the media frames of 1.5 million New York Times articles published from 2000 to 2017. By examining the ebb and flow of media frames over almost two decades, we show that short-term frame abundance fluctuation closely corresponds to major events, while there also exist several long-term trends, such as the gradually increasing prevalence of the "Cultural identity" frame. By examining specific topics and sentiments, we identify characteristics and dynamics of each frame. Finally, as a case study, we delve into the framing of mass shootings, revealing three major framing patterns. Our scalable, computational approach to massive news datasets opens up new pathways for systematic media framing studies. • Human-centered computing → Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing.

7b5d2fb14ebf9d38726c21773212fa5f65575b6f	The new coronavirus respiratory syndrome disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major health problem worldwide. Many attempts have been devoted to modeling the dynamics of new infection rates, death rates, and the impact of the disease on health systems and the world economy. Most of these modeling concepts use the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental models; however, wide imprecise outcomes in forecasting can occur with these models in the context of poor data, low testing levels, and a nonhomogeneous population. : medRxiv preprint Our model estimated that the number of infected individuals would be approximately 6.5 million (median) on April 25, 2020, and would reach 16 to 17 million (median) by the end of August 2020 in Brazil. The probability that an infected individual requires ICU-level care in Brazil is 0.5833% . Our model suggests that the current level of mitigation seen in São Paulo is sufficient to reach R t < 1, thus attaining a "peak" in the short term. In São Paulo state, the total number of deaths is estimated to be around 9,000 (median) with the 2.5% quantile being 6,600 deaths and the 97.5% quantile being around 13,350 deaths. Also, São Paulo will not attain its maximum capacity of ICU beds if the current trend persists over the long term.
c377c497135c1f3103d8bc7ed5988b44eb6e6603	The Smart Grids (SGs) consist of an emerging paradigm that pave the way for the power grids' modernization and seek novel techniques for improving the transmittion and distribution of power to consumers, as well as achieving end-to-end real-time governance. Thus, the prospect of SGs are to behave intelligently, through the deployment of advanced technologies, applications and standards. A subset of such technologies and applications consists of Software Defined Netowrks (SDNs), Cloud Computing (CC), Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, Big Data applications, Internet-of-Things (IoT), 5G and wireless standards such as IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE 802.16.1. The SGs, the CC and the IoT paradigms' convergence lie on satisfying the clients' needs, improving efficiency and in the same time maintaining overall control. However, the coupling of diverse technologies under a unified architecture raise multiple interdependencies which pose new challenges, ranging from the reliability of the whole power system to novel cyber-security risks. This paper sheds new light in the overall definition of the threat landscape that emerges by the convergence of CC and IoT in a SG.

Our problem is centered in the post operative follow up of those patients who underwent an elective procedure immediately before the isolation and those who require an emergency surgery. We outline the measures we have taken to reduce the possibility of spread of the virus.
7e7ca65fe4c9b146a13b29b9e88f98881c42aa94	Dear Editor, We read with great interest the letter form Haaksma and co-workers titled "Lung ultrasound and B-lines: B careful!" [1] . The authors found that lung ultrasound (LUS) reproducibility of B-lines detection with different transducers and raters was poor to moderate and raised a relevant issue. B-lines are dynamic LUS artifacts, moving and potentially changing appearance over the respiratory cycle, associated with increased extravascular lung water or partial lung loss of aeration. Although the recognition of B-lines and discrimination of A-from B-pattern are simple tasks, the quantification of B-lines and the assessment of their spacing can be challenging: easily counted when few, it becomes impossible to enumerate them precisely when numerous and tending to merge (as often happens in the interstitial-alveolar syndromes). Semiquantitative methods have been proposed to quantify B-lines based on visual estimation of screen percentage occupied by them [2] or on the presence/absence of their coalescence [3] . These methods may be prone to errors either due to inter-operator "eyeballing" variability or to assessment of their coalescence without considering its overall pleural extension. The current recommendation to assess the percentage of pleural line occupied by B-lines (rather than counting their maximum number over each ultrasound scan) [2] may also lead to inaccurate results. At present, no tool is available to quantify the percentage of pleural line occupied by B-lines. This may not be a simple cognitive process because: (1) the distance
d0573b9ccab05a0596ddd87513c89bea40f7e0bb	Background: COVID-19 is a global pandemic but the follow-up data of discharged patients was barely described. Aims: To investigate clinical outcomes, distribution of quarantine locations, and the infection status of the contacts of COVID-19 patients after discharge. Design: A prospective cohort study Methods: Demographics, baseline characteristics of 131 COVID-19 patients discharged from February 3 to 21, 2020 in Wuhan, China were collected and analyzed by reviewing the medical records retrospectively. Post-hospitalization data related to clinical outcomes, quarantine locations and close contact history were obtained by following up the patients every week up to 4 weeks. Results: 53 (40.05%) patients on discharge had cough (29.01%), fatigue (7.63%), expectoration (6.11%), chest tightness (6.11%), dyspnea (3.82%), chest pain (3.05%), and palpitation (1.53%). These symptoms constantly declined in 4 weeks post discharge. Transient fever recurred in 11 (8.4%) patients. 78 (59.5%) discharged patients underwent chest CT and 2 (1.53%) showed deterioration. 94 (71.8%) patients received SARS-CoV-2 retest and 8 (6.10%) reported positive. 7 (2.29%) patients were re-admitted because of fever or positive SARS-CoV-2 retest. 121 (92.37%) and 4 (3.05%) patients were self-quarantined at home or community spots following discharge, with totally 167 closely contacted persons free of COVID-19 at the endpoint of study. https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/qjm Conclusions: The majority of COVID-19 patients after discharge were in the course of recovery. Readmission was required in rare cases due to suspected recurrence of COVID-19. Although no contacted infection observed, appropriate self-quarantine and regular reexamination are necessary, particularly for those who have recurred symptoms.
67c70abb937f19902e2b7c191770c8f844131625	Stone quarrying and crushing spits huge stone dust to the environment and causes threats to ecosystem components as well as human health. Imposing emergency lockdown to stop infection of COVID 19 virus on 24.03.2020 in India has created economic crisis but it has facilitated environment to restore its quality. Global scale study has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible impact at regional level is not investigated yet. Middle catchment of Dwarka river basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore the region is highly polluted. The present study has attempted to explore the impact of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived data in pre and during lockdown periods. Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM10 concentration was 189 to 278µg/m 3 in pre lockdown period and it now ranges from 50 to 60 µg/m 3 after 18 days of the commencement of lockdown in selected four stone crushing clusters. LST is reduced by 3-5ºC, noise level is dropped to <65dBA which was above 85dBA in stone crusher dominated areas in pre lockdown period. Adjacent river water is qualitatively improved due to stoppage of dust release to the river. For instance, total Journal Pre-proof

As part of the workup, a standardised panel of blood tests were performed including full blood count, creatinine, CRP, D-dimer and serum total cortisol. Clinical and demographic data was extracted from patient records. Pre-selected demographics and co-morbidities of interest (age, sex, history of diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), endocrine disease, current diagnosis of cancer at time of admission, obstructive pulmonary disease including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, current pregnancy) were recorded, and contemporaneous pre-selected laboratory values of interest (cortisol, creatinine, Ddimer, CRP, neutrophil to leukocyte ratio or N:L ratio) were recorded.
f83ff7d3c8a405f8b6979b6a27c46fe5becfcdc6	Building on the model of Russell and Hall for the emergence of life at a warm submarine hydrothermal vent, we suggest that, within a hydrothermally formed system of contiguous iron-sulfide (FeS) compartments, populations of virus-like RNA molecules, which eventually encoded one or a few proteins each, became the agents of both variation and selection. The initial darwinian selection was for molecular self-replication. Combinatorial sorting of genetic elements among compartments would have resulted in preferred proliferation and selection of increasingly complex molecular ensembles -those compartment contents that achieved replication advantages. The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) we propose was not freeliving but an inorganically housed assemblage of expressed and replicable genetic elements. The evolution of the enzymatic systems for (i) DNA replication; and (ii) membrane and cell wall biosynthesis, enabled independent escape of the first archaebacterial and eubacterial cells from their hydrothermal hatchery, within which the LUCA itself remained confined.
80dd39bc7260a4a8db7090350a0b958fd9459b8d	The intracellular expression of antibodies or antibody fragments (intrabodies) in different compartments of mammalian cells allows to block or modulate the function of endogenous molecules. Intrabodies can alter protein folding, proteinprotein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA interactions and protein modification. They can induce a phenotypic knockout and work as neutralizing agents by direct binding to the target antigen, by diverting its intracellular traffic or by inhibiting its association with binding partners. They have been largely employed as research tools and are emerging as therapeutic molecules for the treatment of human diseases as viral pathologies, cancer and misfolding diseases. The fast growing bio-market of recombinant antibodies provides intrabodies with enhanced binding specificity, stability and solubility, together with lower immunogenicity, for their use in therapy. This chapter describes the crucial aspects required to express intrabodies in different intracellular compartments of mammalian cells, their various modes of action and gives an update on the applications of intrabodies in human diseases.

478803202ddd4808c2d205fb8d8bc7c8ed2d566c	COVID-19 has changed life beyond recognition for millions of individuals, as countries implement social distancing measures to prevent disease transmission. For certain patient groups, such as community-dwelling older people with dementia (PwD), these restrictions may have far-reaching consequences. Medicines management may be adversely affected and deserves careful thought. PwD face unique challenges with medicines management compared to other older people, often relying upon support from family/carers and primary healthcare professionals. This article considers potential issues that PwD may face with each component of medicines management (prescribing, dispensing, administration, adherence, review), and based on previous research, highlights strategies to support PwD and their carers during this time. Primary healthcare professionals must be attentive to medicines-related needs of community-dwelling PwD, particularly those living alone, both during the pandemic and as restrictions are lifted. Carers of PwD continue to have a critical role to play in medicines management, and also require support.
af7fb7f503fa56b9716c2da5d08300e5cfc2fde1	Metalloproteinases-such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs)-are involved in various diseases of the nervous system but also contribute to nervous system development, synaptic plasticity and neuroregeneration upon injury. MMPs and ADAMs proteolytically cleave many substrates including extracellular matrix components but also signaling molecules and receptors. During neuroinfectious disease with associated neuroinflammation, MMPs and ADAMs regulate blood-brain barrier breakdown, bacterial invasion, neutrophil infiltration and cytokine signaling. Specific and broad-spectrum inhibitors for MMPs and ADAMs have experimentally been shown to decrease neuroinflammation and brain damage in diseases with excessive neuroinflammation as a common denominator, such as pneumococcal meningitis and multiple sclerosis, thereby improving the disease outcome. Timing of metalloproteinase inhibition appears to be critical to effectively target the cascade of pathophysiological processes leading to brain damage without inhibiting the neuroregenerative effects of metalloproteinases. As the critical role of metalloproteinases in neuronal repair mechanisms and regeneration was only lately recognized, the original idea of chronic MMP inhibition needs to be conceptually revised. Recently accumulated research urges for a second chance of metalloproteinase inhibitors, which-when correctly applied and dosed-harbor the potential to improve the outcome of different neuroinflammatory diseases.

049ea432acc08b04a3e21c390f62be3d845a2e2c	In the last few months, the novel COVID-19 pandemic has spread all over the world. Due to its easy transmission, developing techniques to accurately and easily identify the presence of COVID-19 and distinguish it from other forms of flus and pneumonia is crucial. Recent research has shown that the chest X-rays of patients suffering from COVID-19 depicts certain abnormalities in the radiography. However, those approaches are closed source and not made available to the research community for re-producibility and gaining a deeper insight. The goal of this work is to build open source and open access datasets and present an accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework for differentiating COVID-19 cases from other pneumonia cases. Our work utilizes state of the art training techniques including progressive resizing, cyclical learning rate finding and discriminative learning rates to training fast and accurate residual neural networks. Using these techniques, we showed state of the art results on the open access COVID-19 dataset. This work presents a 3-step technique to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture to improve model performance and reduce training timewe call it COVID-ResNet. This is achieved through progressively resizing of input images to 128x128x3, 224x224x3, and 229x229x3 pixels and fine-tuning the network at each stage. This approach along with the automatic learning rate selection enabled us to achieve state of the accuracy of 96.23% (on all the classes) on the COVIDx dataset with only 41 epochs. This work presented a computationally efficient and highly accurate model for multi-class classification of three different infection types from along with Normal individuals. This model can help in early screening of COVID-19 cases and help reduce burden on healthcare systems.

9fee13458c2afb3c9dac6c04c0ccf070d703f54d	Background: Acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome continue to be significant causes of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care setting. The failure of patients to resolve the alveolar edema associated with these conditions is a major contributing factor to mortality; hence there is continued interest to understand the mechanisms of alveolar edema fluid clearance. Discussion: The accompanying review by Vadász et al. details our current understanding of the signaling mechanisms and cellular processes that facilitate clearance of edema fluid from the alveolar compartment, and how these signaling processes may be exploited in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To complement that report this review focuses on how intact organ and animal models and clinical studies have facilitated our understanding of alveolar edema fluid clearance in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, it considers how what we have learned from these animal and organ models and clinical studies has suggested novel therapeutic avenues to pursue.
129dc6de7b9c27b47ea345030af62dd0de3e3a81	Keywords: acute coronary syndrome • myocardial injury • percutaneous coronary intervention • SARS-CoV-2 • sepsis-related cardiomyopathy • ST-elevation myocardial infarction • stress-induced cardiomyopathy • thromboembolism Coronavirus disease 2019 was first identified in December 2019, yet within months it had spread to pandemic levels with critical global health implications to the clinical practice of all specialties. In cardiology, COVID-19 has imposed an unfortunate conundrum: the disease is significantly associated with death in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, [1, 2] and yet hospital admissions and certain cardiac procedures have significantly declined compared with prior years [3] [4] [5] . This creates a potentially multiplicative problem if COVID-19 and its etiologic virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), directly or indirectly cause increased cardiac damage while patients with cardiac disease are simultaneously undertreated for pre-existing or de novo illness. Here, we assess how COVID-19 may have influenced this apparent decline in cardiac care. We also consider how clinicians can optimize the diagnostic process to provide appropriate and timely patient care in the setting of increased uncertainty regarding the etiology of acute cardiovascular disease. This process is dynamic and will necessitate adaptive strategies over time, particularly as many hospitals, states and countries transition slowly toward the re-escalation of standard operations while being mindful of COVID-19 resurgence. In spite of numerous mechanisms that may increase the likelihood or severity of cardiovascular disease in COVID-19, many centers have thus far reported a decline in the number of patients admitted for the acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A recent report from the British Heart Foundation revealed that the patient footfall seeking medical attention for myocardial infarction, which is defined as myocardial cell death due to prolonged ischemia, was essentially halved in March 2020, compared with the same period a year ago in England [6] . This worrying trend is similarly observed in other countries severely affected by COVID-19, including the USA [5] and Spain; [7] the latter saw, among its 81 centers, the numbers of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (48% decrease), cardiac structural interventions (81% decrease) and diagnostic procedures (56% decrease) dropped, significantly. Several societal, health system and infection-control issues have likely contributed to the decreased frequency of timely cardiac diagnoses during this pandemic. The morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 understandably begets fear and concerns in the general population. Coupled with government public health policies recommending patients to avoid the hospital unless suffering from severe COVID-19 symptoms or medical emergencies, rates of hospitalization have overall decreased. While a bona fide reduction in the incidence of ACS in the general population due to the imposed Future Cardiol. (Epub ahead of print)

0d0419bc4ee894bbfe1f761d5efa0a556120f13f	Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is a widespread infection that has created a bad memory in Africa. In the 2014 and 2015 outbreak, more than 28,000 infections were reported by the World Health Organization, with about 11,300 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5), termed also GRP78, is a host cell chaperone protein responsible for the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under stress, HSPA5 is upregulated and becomes cell-surface exposed. Recent studies report the association of cell-surface HSPA5 with EBOV glycoproteins GP1 and GP2. In this study, structural and sequence analysis and molecular docking are used to predict the possible binding site between the cell-surface HSPA5 and EBOV GP1. The results show a promising binding site that supports the hypothesis of HSPA5 selectivity for binding to a specific peptide sequence (pep42). This study paves the way to suggest possible inhibitors to stop viral association with cell-surface receptors and subsequently reduce viral infection.

4a4d8ea9e1162313302a4cb6e71cf6ee49fb81c0	We examine the use of computer-based learning in the classroom and the effect of immediate feedback on student performance. Since it is well known in educational research that it is possible to observe a "Matthew Effect" in which the rich get richer, we wanted to see if feedback was useful for low prior knowledge students, as defined by students whose pretest score was at or below the median. In this counterbalanced randomized controlled trial, 243 tenth and eleventh grade mathematics students were exposed to one of two conditions, as we measured their learning from: 1) immediate feedback (where the computer told them correctness and they could also ask for hints) or 2) practice only (where they received feedback only after taking a posttest). Results suggest that immediate feedback from computer-based learning tasks benefit both high and low prior knowledge students, with low prior knowledge students exhibiting greater gains. The implications of these findings support further investigation into the use of computer-based learning tasks that provide immediate feedback.
9d089e7e76ca5c8e8225d18ee8712f3c8a623478	We report a longitudinal analysis of the immune response associated with a fatal case of COVID-19 in Europe. This patient exhibited a rapid evolution towards multiorgan failure. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple nasopharyngeal, blood, and pleural samples, despite antiviral and immunomodulator treatment. Clinical evolution in the blood was marked by an increase (2-3-fold) in differentiated effector T cells expressing exhaustion (PD-1) and senescence (CD57) markers, an expansion of antibody-secreting cells, a 15-fold increase in γδ T cell and proliferating NK-cell populations, and the total disappearance of monocytes, suggesting lung trafficking. In the serum, waves of a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm, Th1 and Th2 activation, and markers of T cell exhaustion, apoptosis, cell cytotoxicity, and endothelial activation were observed until the fatal outcome. This case underscores the need for well-designed studies to investigate complementary approaches to control viral replication, the source of the hyperinflammatory status, and immunomodulation to target the pathophysiological response. The investigation was conducted as part of an overall French clinical cohort assessing patients with COVID-19 and registered in clinicaltrials.gov under the following number: NCT04262921.
41ef84db74b6e936d2a7463cc989213b3d340c15	The exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date. The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behavior, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multiroute transmitted respiratory infection. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines virus content in droplets, exposure distance, and virus dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provides a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the transmission efficiency of different transmission routes of respiratory diseases and provides a basis for predicting the impact of individual level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.

Architecture modelling is achieved by means of logics. We introduce an extended propositional interaction logic and investigate its first-order level which serves as a formal language for the interactions of parametric systems. Our logic effectively describes the execution order of interactions which is a main feature in several important architectures. We state the decidability of equivalence, satisfiability, and validity of first-order extended interaction logic formulas, and provide several examples of formulas describing well-known architectures.
d6ea6fe5bc830de344bba6f258f4b70ce6e65f1a	This study was to determine if feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected and uninfected Crandall feline kidney (CRFK) cells exhibited a low temperature (16~ block in membrane trafficking between transitional endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus represented by intermediate compartment formation. Ceils were cultured at different temperatures and membrane changes involving the Golgi apparatus and Golgi apparatus-associated membrane structures were monitored by electron microscopy and quantitated. With 30 min of incubation, membranes of the Golgi apparatus stack increased in amount at temperatures of 16 ~ and below compared to temperatures above 18 ~ The increase was greatest along the major polarity axis as evidenced by an increased stack height. Neither the number of cisternae per stack nor the average stack diameter (width) was affected by temperature. The response was maximal between 15 and 30 rain of low temperature treatment of the cells. Results with cells infected and uninfected with feline immunodeficiency virus were similar. The increase in stack height was due primarily to an increase of membranes at the cis face (cis Golgi apparatus network). At 18 ~ membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus network accumulated suggesting that import from the cis Golgi network could proceed at this temperature, whereas exit from the trans Golgi network was still at least partially blocked. Also increased at 16 ~ and below were numbers of transition vesicles in the space between the Golgi apparatus and the transitional endoplasmic reticulum associated with the cis Golgi apparatus face. The results suggested interruption of the orderly flux of membranes into the Golgi apparatus at 16~ and below. Moreover, the block appeared to be reversible. Upon transfer from 16~ to 37~ there was a time-dependent decrease in the accumulations of cis compartment membrane accompanied by a corresponding equivalent increase in the membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus compartment.
1fb6d39474330339cd7f073e0719d9ef0d6cad33	Proteomic approaches can be a useful means of identifying targets for identifying and treating a variety of infectious agents. This is especially true for agents responsible for emerging infections or those important to biodefense. Keywords reverse-phase protein microarray; mass spectrometry; protein-protein interactions. Correspondence Viruses have developed numerous and elegant strategies to manipulate the host cell machinery to establish a productive infectious cycle. The interaction of viral proteins with host proteins plays an important role in infection and pathogenesis, often bypassing traditional host defenses such as the interferon response and apoptosis. Host-viral protein interactions can be studied using a variety of proteomic approaches ranging from genetic and biochemical to large-scale high-throughput technologies. Protein interactions between host and viral proteins are greatly influenced by host signal transduction pathways. In this review, we will focus on comparing proteomic information obtained through differing technologies and how their integration can be used to determine the functional aspect of the host response to infection. We will briefly review and evaluate techniques employed to elucidate viral-host interactions with a primary focus on Protein Microarrays (PMA) and Mass Spectrometry (MS) as potential tools in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. As many potential molecular markers and targets are proteins, proteomic profiling is expected to yield both clearer and more direct answers to functional and pharmacologic questions.
f1473f0ab34b7df80b30d91e695e0d10899a317c	Viral respiratory infections are caused by a variety of different virus species such as human rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus. As the life cycles of these viruses are quite different, the development of a general treatment for respiratory infections seems impossible. For specific viruses however significant progress has been achieved, although only for influenza virus antiviral medication has reached the market. We present different approaches to inhibit respiratory viruses with a focus on human rhinoviruses, the most frequent cause of common cold. 1.

However, basic research and clinical practice in the lung regeneration remains crawling. Owing to the complicated three dimensional structures and above 40 types of pulmonary cells, the regeneration of lung tissues becomes a great challenge. Compelling evidence has showed that distinct populations of intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary stem/progenitor cells can regenerate epithelia as well as endothelia in various parts of the respiratory tract. Recently, the discovery of human lung stem cells and their relevant studies has opened the door of hope again, which might put us on the path to repair our injured body parts, lungs on demand. Herein, we emphasized the role of endogenous and exogenous stem/progenitor cells in lungs as well as artificial tissue repair for the injured lungs, which constitute a marvelous toolbox for the treatment of acute lung injury. Finally, we further discussed the potential problems in the pulmonary remodeling and regeneration.
dec74cc079f5d472258b50793628686a21503e5e	The new coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a new type of virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Environmental conditions necessary for survival and spread of 2019-nCoV are somewhat transparent but unlike animal coronaviruses. We are poorly aware of their survival in environment and precise factors of their transmission. Countries located in east and west of globe did not have a significant impact on prevalence of disease among communities, and on the other hand, north and south have provided a model for relative prediction of disease outbreaks. The 2019-nCoV can survive for up to 9 days at 25°C, and if this temperature rises to 30°C, its lifespan will be shorter. The 2019-nCoV is sensitive to humidity, and lifespan of viruses in 50% humidity is longer than that of 30%. Also, temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the COVID-19 mortality rate and may facilitate 2019-nCoV transmission. Thus, considering the available and recent evidence, it seems that low temperatures, as well as dry and unventilated air, may affect stability and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.

Namely, we exploit an extensive host of publicly available and novel social media datasets to train bidirectional encoders from transformer models (BERT) to predict age, dialect, gender, emotion, irony, and sentiment. AraNet delivers state-of-the-art performance on a number of the cited tasks and competitively on others. In addition, AraNet has the advantage of being exclusively based on a deep learning framework and hence feature-engineering free. To the best of our knowledge, AraNet is the first to performs predictions across such a wide range of tasks for Arabic NLP and thus meets a critical needs. We publicly release AraNet to accelerate research and facilitate comparisons across the different tasks.

b147a9e7654ef4257a7c45cae6606543a7864c80	Background: FTY720 (fingolimod) is the first oral drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with the relapsing-remitting form of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. Evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 occurs by preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes thereby inhibiting the infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesized that FTY720 treatment would affect lymphocyte migration to the CNS and influence disease severity in a mouse model of viral-induced neurologic disease. Methods: Mice were infected intracranially with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Infected animals were treated with increasing doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of FTY720 and morbidity and mortality recorded. Infiltration of inflammatory virus-specific T cells (tetramer staining) into the CNS of FTY720-treated mice was determined using flow cytometry. The effects of FTY720 treatment on virus-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity were also determined. The severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination in FTY720-treated mice was examined by flow cytometry and histopathologically, respectively, in the spinal cords of the mice. Results: Administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased clinical disease severity and mortality. These results correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication (P < 0.05) within the CNS at days 7 and 14 post-infection, which was associated with diminished accumulation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.05) into the CNS. Reduced neuroinflammation in FTY720-treated mice correlated with increased retention of T lymphocytes within draining cervical lymph nodes (P < 0.05). Treatment with FTY720 did not affect virus-specific T cell proliferation, expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α or cytolytic activity. FTY720-treated mice exhibited a reduction in the severity of demyelination associated with dampened neuroinflammation. Conclusion: These findings indicate that FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses through impacting migration and accumulation of virus-specific T cells within the CNS during acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis. FTY720 treatment reduces the severity of neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination by restricting the access of disease-causing lymphocytes into the CNS but is not associated with viral recrudescence in this model.
eef23bfc78393721d7c84bca00b0697dbcd00ed2	The current coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China, has raised significant social, psychological and economic concerns in addition to direct medical issues. The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 to almost every country on the globe and the failure to contain the infections have contributed to fear and panic worldwide. The lack of available and efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines has further worsened the situation. For these reasons, it cannot be overstated that an accelerated effort for the development of novel drugs and vaccines is needed. In this context, novel approaches in both gene therapy and vaccine development are essential. Previous experience from SARS-and MERS-coronavirus vaccine and drug development projects have targeted glycoprotein epitopes, monoclonal antibodies, angiotensin receptor blockers and gene silencing technologies, which may be useful for COVID-19 too. Moreover, existing antivirals used for other types of viral infections have been considered as urgent action is necessary. This review aims at providing a background of coronavirus genetics and biology, examples of therapeutic and vaccine strategies taken and potential innovative novel approaches in progress.
85014021fd768128ce2b9146a156190ccdad429e	We found that the butanol fraction of Cinnamomi Cortex (CC/Fr.2) showed moderate inhibitory activity in wild-type severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (wtSARS-CoV) and HIV/SARS-CoV S pseudovirus infections. The inhibition on pseudovirus was also seen in cells pretreated with the CC and CC/Fr.2 (IC 50S , 283.4 ± 16.3 and 149.5 ± 13.5 g/ml, respectively), however the highest activities on wtSARS-CoV were observed when the viruses were treated by the extracts before challenging (IC 50S , 43.1 ± 2.8 and 7.8 ± 0.3 g/ml; SIs, 8.4 and 23.1, respectively). Among the compounds fractionated from CC, procyanidin A2 and procyanidin B1 showed moderate anti-wtSARS-CoV activity (IC 50S , 29.9 ± 3.3 and 41.3 ± 3.4 M; SIs, 37.35 and 15.69, respectively). We also sought to determine whether they could interfere with the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway using transferrin receptor (TfR) as an indicator. CC/Fr.2 inhibited the internalization of TfR but the procyanidins did not. Taken together, CC/Fr.2 contains unknown substances, that could inhibit the infection, probably by interfering with endocytosis, and it also contains procyanidins that did not inhibit the internalization but inhibited the infection. Therefore, CC extracts contain anti-virus activities that act through distinct mechanisms according to differences in the compounds or mixtures.
6d002db4a643cb5525e9a3b80954b75973706d6b	Infected people are isolated to minimize the spread of pandemic diseases. Therefore, the factors related to self-isolation (SI) should not be neglected, and it is important to investigate the factors leading the infected (or possibly infected) people to choose to self-isolate. In this paper, we tried to show that the theory of planned behavior provides a useful conceptual framework for SI when facing a pandemic risk, and a regression method with Chinese provincial (Guangdong Province) data was applied to investigate how attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) influence SI when facing a pandemic emergency. The results and the robustness tests confirm that ATT, SN, and PBC have a significant positive influence on SI when facing a pandemic emergency. ATT plays the most important role, followed by SN and then PBC. Based on the factors of SI, we found, through theoretical and empirical analyses, at least three important aspects that local governments need to consider to encourage citizens to self-isolate when facing a pandemic.
e5cb88d82b356325cd2baf6cff0698c51d6a69e8	Background: Current guidelines for the treatment of adult severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) consist of high-quality evidence reports, but they are no longer accompanied by management protocols, as these require expert opinion to bridge the gap between published evidence and patient care. We aimed to establish a modern sTBI protocol for adult patients with both intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain oxygen monitors in place. Our consensus working group consisted of 42 experienced and actively practicing sTBI opinion leaders from six continents. Having previously established a protocol for the treatment of patients with ICP monitoring alone, we addressed patients who have a brain oxygen monitor in addition to an ICP monitor. The management protocols were developed through a Delphi-method-based consensus approach and were finalized at an in-person meeting. We established three distinct treatment protocols, each with three tiers whereby higher tiers involve therapies with higher risk. One protocol addresses the management of ICP elevation when brain oxygenation is normal. A second addresses management of brain hypoxia with normal ICP. The third protocol addresses the situation when both intracranial hypertension and brain hypoxia are present. The panel considered issues pertaining to blood transfusion and ventilator management when designing the different algorithms.
6cd877aceddfcb8f5160d1dd3f49794779613d5b	Background: Health, as defined by the WHO, is a multidimensional concept that includes different aspects. Interest in the health conditions of the oldest-old has increased as a consequence of the phenomenon of population aging. This study investigates whether (1) it is possible to identify health profiles among the oldest-old, taking into account physical, emotional and psychological information about health, and (2) there are demographic and socioeconomic differences among the health profiles. Methods: Latent Class Analysis with covariates was applied to the Mugello Study data to identify health profiles among the 504 nonagenarians residing in the Mugello district (Tuscany, Italy) and to evaluate the association between socioeconomic characteristics and the health profiles resulting from the analysis. Results: This study highlights four groups labeled according to the posterior probability of determining a certain health characteristic: "healthy", "physically healthy with cognitive impairment", "unhealthy", and "severely unhealthy". Some demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were found to be associated with the final groups: older nonagenarians are more likely to be in worse health conditions; men are in general healthier than women; more educated individuals are less likely to be in extremely poor health conditions, while the lowest-educated are more likely to be cognitively impaired; and office or intellectual workers are less likely to be in poor health conditions than are farmers. Conclusions: Considering multiple dimensions of health to determine health profiles among the oldest-old could help to better evaluate their care needs according to their health status.

bf87996bb6c0dbed5de9512ac2bab800417a8956	Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with a disease fatality rate between 15% and 70%. Despite the wide range of distribution, the virus (CCHFV) is basically endemic in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Acute febrile illness associated with petechiae, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease. With all these fatal effects, CCHFV is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV. Both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were assessed, and the epitope "DCSSTPPDR" was found to be the most potential one, with 100% conservancy among all the strains of CCHFV. The epitope was also found to interact with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well. In vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production, which might be an effective path to prevent CCHF disease.

We also propose Avg Pegasos and Max Pegasos, which are extensions of the Pegasos algorithm. We also provide mistake bounds for Avg Perceptron and regret bound for Avg Pegasos. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches by experimenting on various datasets and comparing them with the standard Perceptron and Pegasos. The online version of this chapter (https://

The use of bleeding time tests in TBI management is controversial. We hypothesized that in TBI patients with AUD, a prolonged bleeding time is associated with more severe injury and poor outcome. Material and methods Moderate and severe TBI patients with evidence of AUD were examined with bleeding time according to IVY bleeding time on admission during neurointensive care. Baseline clinical and radiological characteristics were recorded. A standardized IVY bleeding time test was determined by staff trained in the procedure. Bleeding time test results were divided into normal (≤ 600 s), prolonged (> 600 s), and markedly prolonged (≥ 900 s). Normal platelet count (PLT) was defined as > 150,000/ μL. This cohort was compared with another group of TBI patients without evidence of AUD. Results Fifty-two patients with TBI and AUD were identified, and 121 TBI patients without any history of AUD were used as controls. PLT was low in 44.2% and bleeding time was prolonged in 69.2% of patients. Bleeding time values negatively correlated with PLT (p < 0.05). TBI patients with markedly prolonged values (≥ 900 s) had significantly increased hematoma size, and more frequently required intracranial pressure measurement and mechanical ventilation compared with those with bleeding times < 900 s (p < 0.05). Most patients (88%) with low platelet count had prolonged bleeding time. No difference in 6month outcome between the bleeding time groups was observed (p > 0.05). Subjects with TBI and no evidence for AUD had lower bleeding time values and higher platelet count compared with those with TBI and history of AUD (p < 0.05). Conclusions Although differences in the bleeding time values between TBI cohorts exist and prolonged values may be seen even in patients with normal platelet count, the bleeding test is a marker of primary hemostasis and platelet function with low specificity. However, it may provide an additional assessment in the interpretation of the overall status of TBI patients with AUD. Therefore, the bleeding time test should only be used in combination with the patient's bleeding history and careful assessment of other hematologic parameters.
0ce0545645fdbedcd7326085925e704e4dda720e	Background: Preliminary studies suggest that people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds experience higher mortality from COVID-19 but the underlying reasons remain unclear. Methods: Prospective analysis of registry data describing patients admitted to five acute NHS Hospitals in east London, UK for COVID-19. Emergency hospital admissions with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 aged 16 years or over were included. Data, including ethnicity, social deprivation, frailty, patient care and detailed risk factors for mortality, were extracted from hospital electronic records. Multivariable survival analysis was used to assess associations between ethnic group and mortality accounting for the effects of age, sex and various other risk factors. Results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Findings: 1996 adult patients were admitted between 1 st March and 13 th May 2020. After excluding 259 patients with missing ethnicity data, 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) Black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared to White patients, those from BAME backgrounds were younger, with differing co-morbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and Black patients were more likely to be admitted to intensive care and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1·54, [1·06-2·23]; p=0·023 and 1·80 [1·20-2·71]; p=0·005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1·49 [1·19-1·86]; p<0·001) and Black (HR 1·30 [1·02-1·65]; p=0·036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk-factor adjusted analyses. Interpretation: Patients from Asian and Black backgrounds are more likely to die from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders. Higher rates of invasive ventilation in intensive care indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and Black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19. severity or mortality. However, the underlying causes were unclear. Aggregated US data determined the relative risk of death for those of Black ethnicity compared to White ethnic groups to be 3.57. Three UK biobank cohort studies, limited by low BAME representation, described ethnicity as an independent risk factor of COVID-19 infection, partially attenuated by socio-economic status (SES). Analysis of a London hospital cohort of 520; experiencing 144 deaths, revealed an age and co-morbidity adjusted mortality odds ratio of 1.72 in Black populations of borderline significance. Age and geographical region-adjusted standardised mortality ratios, derived from UK composite hospital data, emphasised ethnic differences; being 2.41 for Bangladeshis and 3.24 for Black Africans. The impact of gender and deprivation was not explored. Another study of 5683 in-hospital deaths (England alone; 629 (11%) BAME) confirmed increased mortality risks in people from Black and Asian groups only partially attributable to social deprivation and co-morbidity but did not adjust for other vulnerability factors. There remained a need for a more detailed analysis of outcomes across different ethnic groups in a large, high acuity dataset, adjusting for broader clinical and laboratory prognostic factors, alongside SES, smoking status, age, body mass index (BMI) and sex.
3bb1bf62e09f90f586662be381ca7660090400a8	To date, the majority of work on RNA virus replication fidelity has focused on the viral RNA polymerase, while the potential role of other viral replicase proteins in this process is poorly understood. Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions. Previous studies using the RNA mutagen ribavirin to select for drug-resistant variants have highlighted the essential role of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in regulating replication fidelity. However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of nucleotides.

Until stable cell lines are developed to increase the titer of this secreted protein in mammalian cell culture, the low yield of spike protein produced from transient transfection of HEK293 cells will be a limiting factor for these assays. To improve the yield of spike protein and support the high demand for antigens in serology assays, we investigated several recombinant protein expression variables by altering the incubation temperature, harvest time, chromatography strategy, and final protein manipulation. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently yields 5 mg of protein per liter of expression culture for two commonly used forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We show that these proteins form well-behaved stable trimers and are consistently functional in serology assays across multiple protein production lots.

770a894578f7a307dc0beb9e5d8c479893e16397	The coronavirus pandemic and the move to teletherapy has created uncertainty among both clinicians and patients. As therapists who work with children, we have heard from parents who are desperate for support and advice about how to respond to their children's behavioral changes, as well as those who feel too overwhelmed to continue their children's sessions at the moment and want to take a break from treatment. We have had to rethink the frame in concrete ways, reimagine how to play, and renegotiate parameters around confidentiality. At a time when fear and uncertainty make mentalizing difficult, the hallmarks of a mentalizing approach-curiosity and flexibility-are most critical. This paper will describe how the Mentalization-Based Treatment for Children (MBT-C) model offers a framework for an integrative approach that can inform treatment via teletherapy, so that clinicians can continue supporting young people and their families through this period. We will begin by describing how the mentalizing stance, particularly an awareness of our own mentalizing capacities in the moment, has become more important than ever. Ways in which clinicians maintain their mentalizing in the face of the mentalizing breakdowns will be also discussed. Finally, we illustrate with clinical vignettes how the developmental levels of mentalizing-attention control, emotion regulation, and explicit mentalizing-can inform the structure, techniques and interventions in teletherapy with children and parents.

1bcfd5b202aad0aa650233d42247cf8c63864c67	FCoV biotypes that cause FIP are designated feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and are distinguished by their ability to infect macrophages and monocytes. Antigenically similar to their virulent counterparts are FCoV biotypes designated feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which usually cause only mild enteritis and are unable to efficiently infect macrophages and monocytes. The FCoV spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell and has previously been shown to determine the distinct tropism exhibited by certain isolates of FIPV and FECV, however, the molecular mechanism underlying viral pathogenesis has yet to be determined. Here we show that the FECV strain WSU 79-1683 (FECV-1683) is highly dependent on host cell cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity for entry into the host cell, as well as on the low pH of endocytic compartments. In addition, both cathepsin B and cathepsin L are able to induce a specific cleavage event in the FECV-1683 spike protein. In contrast, host cell entry by the FIPV strains WSU 79-1146 (FIPV-1146) and FIPV-DF2 proceeds independently of cathepsin L activity and low pH, but is still highly dependent on cathepsin B activity. In the case of FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2, infection of primary feline monocytes was also dependent on host cell cathepsin B activity, indicating that host cell cathepsins may play a role in the distinct tropisms displayed by different feline coronavirus biotypes. #
67e55038298b84f9d71e2e300abcead42e725783	Influenza A virus (IAV) enters cells by binding to sialic acid on the cell surface. To accomplish this while avoiding immobilization by sialic acid in host mucus, viruses rely on a balance between the receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-cleaving protein neuraminidase (NA). Although genetic aspects of this balance are well-characterized, little is known about how the spatial organization of these proteins in the viral envelope may contribute. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HA and NA are asymmetrically distributed on the surface of filamentous viruses, creating a spatial organization of binding and cleaving activities that causes viruses to step consistently away from their NA-rich pole. This Brownian ratchet-like diffusion produces persistent directional mobility that resolves the virus's conflicting needs to both penetrate mucus and stably attach to the underlying cells, potentially contributing to the prevalence of the filamentous phenotype in clinical isolates of IAV.
b4ffcd0614eec614554ca322abf9d7bff6c622b1	Many viruses have been investigated for the development of genetic vaccines and the ideal ones must be endowed with many properties, such as the quality and the quantity of the immunological response induced against the encoded antigens, safety and production on a large scale basis. Viral based vaccines must also deal with the potential problem of the pre-existing antivector immunity. Several viral vaccine vectors have emerged to date, all of them having relative advantages and limits depending on the proposed application. Recent successes re fl ect diverse improvements such as development of new adenovirus serotypes and prime-boost regimes. This chapter describes the features of four viral vector systems based on poxviruses, adenoviruses, alphaviruses and lentiviruses and recent results following their use with a particular emphasis on clinical research, highlighting the challenges and successes.
bfcb22212525a49970dc301582343e388fc5cfd6	Background: Fever is one of the most common symptoms among children and is usually caused by respiratory infections. Although Japanese health authorities have long recommended gargling to prevent respiratory infections, its effectiveness among children is not clear. Methods: The children in this observational study were enrolled from 145 nursery schools in Fukuoka City, Japan. Children in the exposure group were instructed to gargle at least once a day. The endpoints of this study were incidence of fever during the daytime and incidence of sickness absence. Differences among gargling agents for each endpoint were also analyzed. Results: A total of 19 595 children aged 2 to 6 years were observed for 20 days (391 900 person-days). In multivariate logistic regression, the overall odds ratio (OR) for fever onset in the gargling group was significantly lower (OR = 0.68). In age-stratified analysis, ORs were significantly lower at age 2 (OR = 0.67), 4 (OR = 0.46), and 5 (OR = 0.41) years. Regarding sickness absence, the overall OR was 0.92 (not significant) in the gargling group. In age-stratified analysis, ORs were significantly lower at age 4 (OR = 0.68), 5 (OR = 0.59), and 6 (OR = 0.63) years. In subgroup analysis, significantly lower ORs for fever onset were observed for children who gargled with green tea (OR = 0.32), functional water (OR = 0.46), or tap water (OR = 0.70). However, the ORs were not significant for sickness absence. Conclusions: Gargling might be effective in preventing febrile diseases in children.
f70ebaae9cd9e020abf8ffa0f828558cb80c9b9d	Viral interferon (IFN) antagonist proteins mediate evasion of IFN-mediated innate immunity 16 and are often multifunctional, having distinct roles in viral replication processes. Functions of 17 the Ebola virus (EBOV) IFN antagonist VP24 include nucleocapsid assembly during 18 cytoplasmic replication and inhibition of IFN-activated signalling by STAT1. For the latter, 19 VP24 prevents STAT1 nuclear import via competitive binding to nuclear import receptors 20 (karyopherins). Many viral proteins, including proteins from viruses with cytoplasmic 21 replication cycles, interact with the trafficking machinery to undergo nucleocytoplasmic 22 Ebola virus (EBOV) is the causative agent of ongoing outbreaks of severe haemorrhagic fever 34 with case-fatality rates between 40 and 60%. Proteins of many viruses with cytoplasmic 35 replication cycles similar to EBOV interact with the nuclear trafficking machinery, resulting 36 in active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling important to immune evasion and other intranuclear 37 functions. However, exploitation of host trafficking machinery for nucleocytoplasmic transport 38 by EBOV has not been directly examined. We find that the EBOV protein VP24 is actively 39 3 trafficked between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and identify the specific pathways and 40 sequences involved. The data indicate that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is important for the 41 multifunctional nature of VP24, which has critical roles in immune evasion and viral 42 replication, identifying a new mechanism in infection by this highly lethal pathogen, and 43 potential target for antivirals. 44 45 Ebola virus, VP24, interferon antagonist, nuclear transport, nuclear export sequence, negative-47 59 VP24 is one of the seven genes typically encoded in the filovirus genome (2) and was originally 60 designated a secondary matrix protein (3). However, accumulating evidence indicates critical 61 roles in genome packaging and the formation, condensation and intracytoplasmic transport of 62 nucleocapsids (4-14). Consistent with this, VP24 localises to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies 63 during infection, which are the sites of replication and nucleocapsid formation (14-16). EBOV 64 4 VP24 also functions as an interferon (IFN) antagonist to suppress the type I IFN-mediated 65 innate antiviral immune response. Specifically, VP24 blocks the nuclear accumulation of the 66 IFN-activated transcription factor STAT1, the key mediator of IFN signalling, by binding 67 competitively to specific karyopherin nuclear import receptors that are responsible for STAT1 68 transport (17)(18)(19)(20). 69 70 Entry to the nucleus is restricted by the impermeable double-membrane nuclear envelope, such 71 that all nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) embedded 72 in the envelope. Proteins/molecules smaller than c. 40-65 kDa are able to diffuse through the 73 NPC, but specific directional transport of protein cargoes is mediated by expression of nuclear 74 localisation and nuclear export sequences (NLSs and NESs) that bind to members of the 75 karyopherin family (also known as importins or exportins) in the cytoplasm or nucleus. 76 Karyopherins mediate energy-dependent translocation of cargo through the NPC (reviewed in 77 (21)); this enables regulable nucleocytoplasmic localisation of proteins, and is absolutely 78 required for transport of cargoes larger than the diffusion limit. In the cytoplasm, karyopherin 79 alpha (K) adaptor proteins typically recognise NLSs comprising mono-or bi-partite 80 sequences enriched in positively-charged residues. Ks also bind to karyopherin beta (K), 81 which facilitates movement of the cargo/K/K complex through the NPC. Ks can 82 additionally directly bind and facilitate import of cargoes containing certain NLSs. Within the 83 nucleus, cargoes containing NESs (commonly a motif of hydrophobic residues) bind to 84 exportins, including the ubiquitously expressed and well-characterised chromosomal 85 maintenance 1 (CRM1), to be exported to the cytoplasm (21). 86 87 STAT1 does not contain a classical NLS and uses a conformational NLS that is presented on 88 IFN-activated parallel STAT1 homodimers and STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers to mediate 89 5 nuclear import, which enables transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (22). STAT1 90 dimers bind to members of the NPI-1 K sub-family (K1, 5 and 6) at a specific site distinct 91 from sites bound by other cellular cargoes containing classical NLSs (18, 23, 24). VP24 binds 92 competitively to this site, inhibiting nuclear import of STAT1, as well as other cellular cargoes 93 that use the same site, but not cargoes that bind elsewhere (17, 18, 20, 25). The interaction 94 between VP24 and K has been the subject of intense research, revealing a well-defined VP24-95 K interface involving contact via three clusters of residues in VP24, with importance to IFN 96 antagonism (19, 20) and VP24 stability (26). 97 98 Several IFN antagonists use karyopherin binding to inhibit nuclear import of host cargo. Severe 99 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF6 protein tethers K1/K2 100 complexes to the ER/golgi membrane, inhibiting IFN-induced STAT1 nuclear import (27). 4b 101 protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) contains a classical 102 bipartite NLS that competes with nuclear factor  (NF-) for K4 to inhibit NF--103 dependent expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (28). While SARS-CoV ORF6 remains 104 cytoplasmic due to ER/Golgi association (27), the 4b NLS-K4 interaction mediates 4b nuclear 105 import, such that this protein is predominantly nuclear (28). Hijacking of nuclear trafficking 106 pathways for import/export of proteins is common in viruses with cytoplasmic replication 107 cycles, including RNA viruses such as MERS-CoV (28), rabies virus (RABV) (29) and 108 henipaviruses (30, 31), and these processes have been linked to pathogenesis. For example, the 109 RABV IFN antagonist P1 protein binds to STAT1 and shuttles via multiple NLSs and NESs, 110 but is largely cytoplasmic due to a dominant NES that effects nuclear exclusion of P1-STAT1 111 complexes. Defective nuclear export of P1 correlates with impaired IFN antagonism and viral 112 attenuation (32-34). Many proteins of cytoplasmic viruses also form intranuclear 113 interactions/functions, including isoforms of RABV P protein and the matrix proteins of Nipah 114 6 and Hendra viruses, enabling cytoplasmic viruses to modulate intranuclear processes (35-37). 115 However, despite extensive characterisation of the VP24-K interaction, the nuclear 116 trafficking profile of VP24 remains unresolved. 117 Here, we report that EBOV VP24 can undergo specific trafficking between the nucleus and 119 cytoplasm, involving a C-terminally located NES that enables CRM1-dependent nuclear 120 export. By identifying critical residues in the NES, we find that VP24 nuclear export is not 121 essential for STAT1 antagonist function, consistent with competitive K binding as the key 122 mechanism, and so appears to be required due to the multifunctional nature of VP24 that 123 involves cytoplasmic roles in the replication cycle, distinct from immune evasion. 124 125 Results EBOV VP24 undergoes nucleocytoplasmic trafficking 127 EBOV VP24 is largely excluded from the nucleus in infected cells (16, 38) and is cytoplasmic 128 or diffuse in transfected cells (17, 19, 20, 39), such that VP24 differs from MERS-CoV 4b, 129 which accumulates within the nucleus (28), but is similar to SARS-CoV ORF6, which is largely 130 cytoplasmic (27). Since VP24 binds to Ks at a site overlapping the site that mediates active 131 nuclear import of STAT1 (20), it appears likely that cytoplasmic localisation is due to physical 132 sequestration (similar to ORF6) or rapid nuclear export following entry to the nucleus. We thus 133 examined whether VP24/K1 complexes can accumulate within the nucleus by expressing 134 full-length VP24 (residues 1-251) fused to GFP (GFP-VP24) or GFP alone in COS7 cells, with 135 or without co-expression of FLAG-tagged K1 or a FLAG control; cells were then 136 immunostained for FLAG and imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Figure  137 1A). Nucleocytoplasmic localisation of the proteins was quantified by calculating the nuclear 138 to cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio (Fn/c, Figure 1B ), as previously (34, 40). 139 157 cytoplasm and nucleus, with negligible effect of LMB. GFP-VP241-251 was predominantly 158 cytoplasmic at steady state in living cells, consistent with localisation of VP24 in fixed cells 159 ( Figure 1) (19, 39) . Following LMB treatment, GFP-VP241-251 clearly re-localised from the 160 cytoplasm to the nucleus (> 4 fold increase in Fn/c), indicating that VP24 undergoes active 161 export from the nucleus mediated by CRM1. 162 163 8 CRM1 facilitates nuclear export of a broad range of cellular and viral cargoes (including RABV 164 P1, Hendra virus matrix protein, Measles virus C protein (31)) that present NESs typically 165 conforming to a motif of hydrophobic residues (L-X(2-3)-L-X(2-3)-L-X-L, where L corresponds fluorescence, corrected for background fluorescence (Fn/c), was calculated for individual cells 388 expressing transfected protein (40); the mean Fn/c was calculated for n  31 cells for each 389 condition in each assay. 390 391 Cells were transfected with plasmids and lysed for immunoprecipitation using GFP-Trap beads 393

We used next generation sequencing (NGs) to investigate the possible infectious causes of gastroenteritis in puppies from a dog kennel in Victoria, Australia. the near complete genome of a canine astrovirus was obtained from pooled faecal samples, and was found to be 94.7% identical with a canine astrovirus detected in the United Kingdom in 2012. The phylogenetic analysis of the capsid gene found similarities to those of canine astroviruses identified in Italy in 2005 and in UK and Hungary in 2012, but distant from that of a canine astrovirus previously identified in Australia in 2012. Thus, different serotypes of canine astrovirus are likely circulating in Australia. The close relationship to european astroviruses also suggested that there had been recent movements of ancestor canine astroviruses between Australia and europe. NGs also detected other infections in the puppies including several canine papillomaviruses and a canine parvovirus (vaccine strain) as well as a very low level of campylobacter. Canine astrovirus was the probable cause of diarrhoea in these puppies, with the possible involvement of campylobacter bacteria. NGS was effective as a non-targeted method to determine the likely infectious cause of gastroenteritis.
da0505e55b70c7dfcd30a54016957910357548f6	The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has made widespread impact recently. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 children with different severities and allergic status. Dataextractedfromtheelectronical medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory andimmunologicalresults and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19 childrenwere summarized and analyzed. The median age was 6 years old, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomaticinfections.Compared to children without pneumonia(manifested as asymptomaticandacuteupperrespiratoryinfection), childrenwithpneumoniawereassociatedwithhigherpercentagesofthe comorbidityhistory, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α.There were no differences of treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered except one deathdue to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%)wasthe major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and asthma. Demographicsand clinical featureswere not significantly different between allergic and non-allergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D-dimer and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared to all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum totalimmunoglobulin E (IgE)levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subsets numbers and serum cytokine levels. Conclusion: Pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and non-allergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, laboratory and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID-19 in children.

This review concentrates on literatures published after 2010 that attempted to detect biological hazards to humans, especially workers, and the efforts to protect them against these factors. It is important to improve the current understanding of the health hazards caused by biological factors at the workplace. In addition, this review briefly describes these factors and provides some examples of their adverse health effects. It also reviews risk assessments, protection with personal protective equipment, prevention with training of workers, regulations, as well as vaccinations.

Currently, Brazil has 773,151 individuals who are imprisoned, with the prison occupancy being almost three times the total capacity; in the central region of Brazil, the rate is even higher 2 . The phenomenon of overcrowding in Brazilian prisons reveals the presence of a flawed and weak penal system, with the unbridled expansion of the prison population resulting in disorders in the prison system.

0ca3486a6b07fa58d3823232cd026be783dd1fe9	A novel SYBR Green based real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of genogroup III bovine noroviruses (BoNoV) was developed and the assay applied to 419 faecal samples from calves with and without diarrhoea. The samples were obtained from 190 Norwegian dairy and beef herds. BoNoV was detected in 49.6% of the samples from 61.1% of the herds indicating that BoNoV is ubiquitous in Norway. The overall prevalence was not significantly different in diarrhoea and non-diarrhoea samples. Analyses of polymerase gene sequences revealed both genotype III/1 and III/2 with genotype III/2 (Newbury2-like) being the most prevalent. Detected capsid sequences were restricted to Newbury2-like and the chimeric Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK strain. The RNA polymerase genotypes of the circulating BoNoVs in Norway were predicted by melting temperature analysis. Additional data from a challenge experiment suggest that a high proportion of young calves are shedding low levels of BoNoV for a prolonged time after recovering from the associated diarrhoea. The findings may explain some of the discrepancies in detection rates from previous studies and explain why some studies have failed to detect significant prevalence differences between calves with and without diarrhoea. It may also shed new light on some epidemiological aspects of norovirus infections.
8878430aac1b32809652a81f70671e236a9fc5bc	The speed and scale of the global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented pressures on health services worldwide, requiring new methods of service delivery during the health crisis. In the setting of severe resource constraint and high risk of infection to patients and clinicians, there is an urgent need to identify consensus statements on head and neck surgical oncology practice. We completed a modified Delphi consensus process of three rounds with 40 international experts in head and neck cancer surgical, radiation, and medical oncology, representing 35 international professional societies and national clinical trial groups. Endorsed by 39 societies and professional bodies, these consensus practice recommendations aim to decrease inconsistency of practice, reduce uncertainty in care, and provide reassurance for clinicians worldwide for head and neck surgical oncology in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the setting of acute severe resource constraint and high risk of infection to patients and staff.
111db95189df3fa90756c174fbb5abff1ca1bb01	Background: Viral infection involves a large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between virus and its host. These interactions range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptor to the hijacking the host transcription machinery by viral proteins. Therefore, identifying PPIs between virus and its host helps understand the mechanism of viral infections and design antiviral drugs. Many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs, but most of them are intended for PPIs within a species rather than PPIs across different species such as PPIs between virus and host. Results: In this study, we developed a prediction model of virus-host PPIs, which is applicable to new viruses and hosts. We tested the prediction model on independent datasets of virus-host PPIs, which were not used in training the model. Despite a low sequence similarity between proteins in training datasets and target proteins in test datasets, the prediction model showed a high performance comparable to the best performance of other methods for single virus-host PPIs. Conclusions: Our method will be particularly useful to find PPIs between host and new viruses for which little information is available. The program and support data are available at http://bclab.inha.ac.kr/VirusHostPPI. to the hijacking the host transcription machinery by viral proteins. Therefore, identifying PPIs between virus and its host helps understand the mechanism of viral infections and design antiviral drugs. Many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs, but most of them are intended for PPIs within a same species rather than for PPIs across different species. Methods for predicting intra-species PPIs do not distinguish interactions between proteins of the same species from those of different species, and thus are not appropriate for predicting inter-species PPIs. Motivated by a recent increase in data of virus-host PPIs, a few computational methods have been developed to predict virushost PPIs using machine learning methods. For instance, a homology-based method [3] and domain-based method [4] were proposed to predict PPIs between H. sapiens and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Cui et al. [5] developed a support
68306c66e265e3245cc8db55e7a8e54269475197	As the world endures the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the conditions of 35 million vulnerable individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs) worldwide have not received sufficient attention for their special health and medical needs. Many of these individuals are complicated by underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular and lung diseases and undermined immune systems. During the pandemic, access to the healthcare systems and support groups is greatly diminished. Current research on COVID-19 has not addressed the unique challenges facing individuals with SUDs, including the heightened vulnerability and susceptibility to the disease. In this systematic review, we will discuss the pathogenesis and pathology of COVID-19, and highlight potential risk factors and complications to these individuals. We will also provide insights and considerations for COVID-19 treatment and prevention in patients with SUDs.
2f38704ef0009750d4c48d1cd7ac81e898023527	Background: Inhibitor of kappa kinase 2 (IKK2) deficiency is a recently described combined immunodeficiency. It undermines the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation pathway. The clinical and immunological data of four patients diagnosed with combined immunodeficiency (CID) from two related Saudi families were collected. Autozygosity mapping of all available members and whole exome sequencing of the index case were performed to define the genetic etiology.
21b9d399fcf199b32c80ecaae8bb3cc1064e7bfb	The epidemic curve and the final extent of the COVID-19 pandemic are usually predicted from the rate of early exponential raising using the SIR model. These predictions implicitly assume a full social mixing, which is not plausible generally. Here I am showing a counterexample to the these predictions, based on random propagation of an epidemic in Barabási-Albert scale-free network models. The start of the epidemic suggests R 0 = 2.6, but unlike Ω ≈ 70% predicted by the SIR model, they reach a final extent of only Ω ≈ 4% without external mitigation. Daily infection rate at the top of the curve is also an order of magnitude less than in SIR models. Quarantining only the 1.5% most active superspreaders has similar effect on extent and top infection rate as blind quarantining a random 50% of the full community.
a893ef3df0a8f91eb0939d99ffa7f3cc1ffa8761	Fetal airway smooth muscle (ASM) exhibits phasic contractile behavior, which transitions to a more sustained "tonic" contraction after birth. The timing and underlying mechanisms of ASM transition from a phasic to a tonic contractile phenotype are yet to be established. We characterized phasic ASM contraction in preterm (128 day gestation), term ($150 day gestation), 1-4 month, 1 yr, and adult sheep (5yr). Spontaneous phasic activity was measured in bronchial segments as amplitude, frequency, and intensity. The mechanism of phasic ASM contraction was investigated further with a computational model of ASM force development and lumen narrowing. The computational model comprised a two-dimensional cylindrical geometry of a network of contractile units and the activation of neighboring cells was dependent on the strength of coupling between cells. As expected, phasic contractions were most prominent in fetal airways and decreased with advancing age, to a level similar to the level in the 1-4 month lambs. Computational predictions demonstrated phasic contraction through the generation of a wave of activation events, the magnitude of which is determined by the number of active cells and the strength of cell-cell interactions. Decreases in phasic contraction with advancing age were simulated by reducing cell-cell coupling. Results show that phasic activity is suppressed rapidly after birth, then sustained at a lower intensity from the preweaning phase until adulthood in an ovine developmental model. Cell-cell coupling is proposed as a key determinant of phasic ASM contraction and if reduced could explain the observed maturational changes.
34641fb9ded209132911fab119ffec92c86a0a9a	J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SUMMARY The safety and efficacy of anti-diabetic drugs are critical for maximizing the benefical impacts of well-controlled blood glucose on the prognosis of individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line medication for T2D, but its impact on the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19 and T2D remains to be clarified. Our current retrospective study in a cohort of 1,213 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D indicated that metformin use was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acidosis, particularly in cases with severe COVID-19, but not with 28-day COVID-19-related mortality. Furthermore, metformin use was significantly associated with reduced heart failure and inflammation. Our findings provide clinical evidence in support of continuing metformin treatment in individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D, but acidosis and kidney function should be carefully monitored in individuals with severe COVID-19.
f48a26496eec9f955c65e9d89305c4bc5df2718a	As the only flying mammal, bats harbor a number of emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which cause severe diseases in humans and other mammals yet result in no clinical symptoms in bats. As the master regulator of the interferon (IFN)-dependent immune response, IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) plays a central role in innate antiviral immunity. To explore the role of bat IRF7 in the regulation of the IFN response, we performed sequence and functional analysis of IRF7 from the pteropid bat, Pteropus alecto. Our results demonstrate that bat IRF7 retains the ability to bind to MyD88 and activate the IFN response despite unique changes in the MyD88 binding domain. We also demonstrate that bat IRF7 has a unique expression pattern across both immune and non-immune related tissues and is inducible by double-strand RNA. The broad tissue distribution of IRF7 may provide bats with an enhanced ability to rapidly activate the IFN response in a wider range of tissues compared to other mammals. The importance of IRF7 in antiviral activity against the bat reovirus, Pulau virus was confirmed by siRNA knockdown of IRF7 in bat cells resulting in enhanced viral replication. Our results highlight the importance of IRF7 in innate antiviral immunity in bats.
db51562632edfb8154e5281475cb8fa8b5ca2423	Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is profoundly affecting life around the globe. Isolation, contact restrictions and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment in affected countries. These measures have the potential to threaten the mental health of children and adolescents significantly.
418bd4c4b37f20dabbb30bb68ccc1dad1d6bf5a2	We recently introduced the concept of the infectome as a means of studying all infectious factors which contribute to the development of autoimmune disease. It forms the infectious part of the exposome, which collates all environmental factors contributing to the development of disease and studies the sum total of burden which leads to the loss of adaptive mechanisms in the body. These studies complement genome-wide association studies, which establish the genetic predisposition to disease. The infectome is a component which spans the whole life and may begin at the earliest stages right up to the time when the first symptoms manifest, and may thus contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmunity at the prodromal/asymptomatic stages. We provide practical examples and research tools as to how we can investigate disease-specific infectomes, using laboratory approaches employed from projects studying the ''immunome'' and ''microbiome''. It is envisioned that an understanding of the infectome and the environmental factors that affect it will allow for earlier patient-specific intervention by clinicians, through the possible treatment of infectious agents as well as other compounding factors, and hence slowing or preventing disease development.
70f5e243b8470f9ebfe2bbad7c0a1b0246d309e2	The novel coronavirus COVID-19, was first identified in China in December 2019. Its spread resulted in a pandemic, with the United Kingdom entering a period of national lockdown on 23 rd March 2020 to reduce disease burden on the National Health Service (NHS). King's College Hospital is a Major Trauma Centre serving an inner-city population of 700,000with 120,000 patients attending the ED annually. We aim to determine the effect of lockdown on OMFS trauma presentations and lessons learned from emergency service provision during a pandemic. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Method: All referrals to the OMFS team from ED during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown period -23 rd March 2020-3rd May 2020were compared with the same 6 week time period for 2019. Results: 111 referrals were made to OMFS during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown period in 2020 compared with 380 referrals in 2019. Of these 50.5%, (n=192) were related to facial trauma in 2019 vs. (63.1%, n=70) in 2020. Fewer patients were admitted under OMFS: 17.4% (n=35) in 2019 vs 2.9%( n=2) in 2020, and a greater number of patients discharged from OMFS care directly from ED: 63.2% (n=127) in 2019 vs. 82.9% (n=58) in 2020. There was profound effect of the lockdown on referrals to OMFS from the ED, in number and diagnosis type. This is potentially reflective of the increased availability of acute/emergency dental services in South-East London during the lockdown period. This gives us valuable insight for service planning in the event of further restrictions.
20d479262ac60088716e0a599584af1494ac37f1	The function of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein p6, encoded by ORF6, is not fully known. Based upon its similarity to p6 from SARS-CoV, it may play a similar role, namely as an antagonist of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Here we report the sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain passaged six times after original isolation from a clinical patient in Hong Kong. The genome sequence shows a 27 nt in-frame deletion (Δ27,264-27,290) within ORF6, predicted to result in a 9 aa deletion (ΔFKVSIWNLD) from the central portion of p6. This deletion is predicted to result in a dramatic alteration in the three-dimensional structure of the resultant protein (p6 Δ22-30 ), possibly with significant functional implications. Analysis of the original clinical sample indicates that the deletion was not present, while sequencing of subsequent passages of the strain identifies the deletion as a majority variant. This suggests that the deletion originated ab initio during passaging and subsequently propagated into the majority, possibly due to the removal of selective pressure through the IFN-deficient Vero E6 cell line. The specific function of the SARS-CoV-2 p6 N-terminus, if any, has not yet been determined. However, this deletion is predicted to cause a shift from N-endo to N-ecto in the transmembrane localization of the SARS-CoV-2 p6 Δ22-30 N-terminus, possibly leading to the ablation of its native function. 2
4229263f00f9e2308a387510a50575a680d57047	Purpose Since the state of alarm was decreed in Spain on 14 March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact in paediatric hospitals. This study shows the effect of the pandemic on our practice in paediatric orthopaedics in a referral third level paediatric hospital. Methods We performed a single-centre retrospective review of the official census from a third level paediatric hospital from Results The patients seen in our clinic during this period in 2020 decreased in by 82% (p < 0.001) compared with 2018 and 2019, however, the number of telemedicine consultations increased by 90.21% (p < 0.001). The total number of patients attending the clinic (including onsite and virtual) was reduced by 54.25% (p < 0.001). The total surgeries performed plummeted by 81% in this period in 2020 (p < 0.001) due to a reduction in elective cases of 94.6% (p < 0.001). No significant decrease was found in the number of urgent surgical cases per day in 2020 (p = 0.34). Finally, the number of orthopaedic patients admitted to our emergency department dropped by 78.6% during the state of alarm (p < 0.001). Conclusion According to our results, the pandemic has significantly affected our daily practice by decreasing elective surgeries and onsite clinics, but other activities have increased. As we have implemented telemedicine and new technologies to adapt to this setback, we should take advantage of the situation to change our practice in the future to better allocate our health resources and to anticipate outbreaks.

ee70819f55471e93c22ce4f697c08e7dccb9ad7a	The Covid-19 pandemic, which originated from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and quickly spread to the rest of the globe is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between the BCG vaccine and the prevalence of Covid-19. The BCG vaccine is used in the prevention of tuberculosis, a disease that is most prevalent in developing countries. To determine the potential protective role of BCG vaccination, this study investigated the occurrence of Covid-19 and the relationship between the spread of Covid-19 in countries that offer BCG vaccination and those that do not. The study also performed a phylogenetic analysis of the strains involved in the Covid-19 outbreak from the representative countries. To achieve the objectives, the study utilized publicly available data on population size, vaccination coverage, and Covid-19 cases. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine if some SARS-CoV-2 strains were more prevalent than others. The study revealed a significant negative trend between countries that offer the BCG vaccine to the general population and the reported cases of Covid-19. The study proposes future molecular and immunological analyses to determine the potential role of BCG vaccination in protection against Covid-19. This will determine if BCG has antiviral properties, with the possibility of recommending it for widespread use if supported by scientific data.
4bdafc7ec7f16a19c7a70d678e0926cdf74ab7f1	Fish production has been practiced since ancient Egypt and China. It has become a fast-growing agricultural sector that provides animal protein for most people globally. While China is the leading country in the world, Egypt and Nigeria stand on the top in Africa. e overall fishery production potential of Ethiopian water bodies is estimated to be 94,500 tons per year, while the actual production is 38,370 tons. Despite more water bodies and more fish diversity in the region, fish production and marketing is very low. is review is undertaken to assess the main factors affecting fish production and the marketing chain in Gambella region. Despite the known water and fish potential of the region, fish production is very low. Major factors contributing to a reduction in fish production in the region include inefficient fishing gears, poor transportation access, poor postharvest handling, low price at the landing site, and improper market place. Drying is the predominant postharvest technique and fishing methods are of a subsistence basis. All the fishing activities take place in the natural environment, and aquaculture is not yet established. Enough modern and efficient gears need to be made available. Other modern postharvest handling techniques need to be introduced to ensure a longer shelf life of fish after harvest. Infrastructures need to be constructed to access all water bodies in the region. Because the region has such water resource potential and incredible fish species diversity, the aquaculture needs to be established and popularized. Traceability needs to be adopted in the region to prevent food-borne diseases. Based on this paper, the government and other stakeholders could develop policy considering the issue of the fishery status of the region.
fba21fe428ec1ad69ee0054fb0a2a29995d07afa	The exact analytical solution in closed form of a modified SIR system is presented. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first closed-form solution for a three-dimensional deterministic compartmental model of epidemics. In this dynamical system the populations S(t) and R(t) of susceptible and recovered individuals are found to be generalized logistic functions, while infective ones I(t) are given by a generalized logistic function times an exponential, all of them with the same characteristic time. The nonlinear dynamics of this modified SIR system is analyzed and the exact computation of some epidemiologically relevant quantities is performed. The main differences between this modified SIR model and original SIR one are presented and explained in terms of the zeroes of their respective conserved quantities. We recall that both models have been recently used in order to describe the essentials of the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.
50d0f5fd4187d914ff40cacb3c436edc5b5bcc00	Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness to non-specific bronchoconstriction agonists as the primary underlying pathophysiology. The worldwide incidence of asthma has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, over 300 million children and adults worldwide currently suffer from this incurable disease and 255,000 die from the disease each year. It is now well accepted that asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome and many clinical subtypes have been described. Viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) have been implicated in asthma exacerbation in children because of their ability to cause severe airway inflammation and wheezing. Infections with atypical bacteria also appear to play a role in the induction and exacerbation of asthma in both children and adults. Recent studies confirm the existence of an infectious asthma etiology mediated by Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and possibly by other viral, bacterial and fungal microbes. It is also likely that early-life infections with microbes such as CP could lead to alterations in the lung microbiome that significantly affect asthma risk and treatment outcomes. These infectious microbes may exacerbate the symptoms of established chronic asthma and may even contribute to the initial development of the clinical onset of the disease. It is now becoming more widely accepted that patterns of airway inflammation differ based on the trigger responsible for asthma initiation and exacerbation. Therefore, a better understanding of asthma subtypes is now being explored more aggressively, not only to decipher pathophysiologic mechanisms but also to select treatment and guide prognoses. This review will explore infection-mediated asthma with special emphasis on the protean manifestations of CP lung infection, clinical characteristics of infection-mediated asthma, mechanisms involved and antibiotic treatment outcomes.
54858134e5322fe2b97e39303e832f4b86d07a58	In the context of long-term screening for viruses on Western Palaearctic bats, we tested for the presence of adenovirus 1392 oropharyngeal swabs and 325 stool samples taken from 27 bat species. Adenoviruses were detected in 12 species of the Vespertilionidae and the Rhinolophidae families. Fifty positive respiratory and 26 positive stool samples were studied. Phylogenetic analyses of partial hexon protein and partial DNA-dependent DNA polymerase genes indicate that all these bat adenoviruses belong to the genus Mastadenovirus but without constituting a monophyletic cluster. According to genetic identities, the new groups are distinct to the previously described Bat mastadenovirus A and B species and contribute with potentially new members. Our data support that diversity of bat mastadenovirus is host-dependent and increase the knowledge of potentially pathogenic virus from bats. Due to the active role of bats as viral reservoirs, the characterization of these viruses is relevant for Public Health.

4c2724f183fa34678d36c94f4798a0697602a9e2	Background: In 2008 a nosocomial outbreak of five cases of viral hemorrhagic fever due to a novel arenavirus, Lujo virus, occurred in Johannesburg, South Africa. Lujo virus is only the second pathogenic arenavirus, after Lassa virus, to be recognized in Africa and the first in over 40 years. Because of the remote, resource-poor, and often politically unstable regions where Lassa fever and other viral hemorrhagic fevers typically occur, there have been few opportunities to undertake in-depth study of their clinical manifestations, transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, or response to treatment options typically available in industrialized countries. We describe the clinical features of five cases of Lujo hemorrhagic fever and summarize their clinical management, as well as providing additional epidemiologic detail regarding the 2008 outbreak. Illness typically began with the abrupt onset of fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias followed successively by sore throat, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, minor hemorrhage, subconjunctival injection, and neck and facial swelling over the first week of illness. No major hemorrhage was noted. Neurological signs were sometimes seen in the late stages. Shock and multi-organ system failure, often with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, ensued in the second week, with death in four of the five cases. Distinctive treatment components of the one surviving patient included rapid commencement of the antiviral drug ribavirin and administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), N-acetylcysteine, and recombinant factor VIIa.
8e050a4a184582f2bf37e750ad65b08be3d0b3c1	In infectious diseases, the routes of transmission play major roles in determining the rate and extent of disease spread. Though fomites and aerosol droplets are major sources of SARS-CoV-2 human to human transmission, studies have also reported possible involvement of other routes of transmission like fecal-oral. Multiple studies around the world have reported shedding of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in certain COVID-19 patient fecal samples. Hence, the major objective of this study was to get the experimental evidence whether in Indian COVID-19 patients fecal dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 genome occurs or not. Information obtained from twelve number of patients from a COVID-19 hospital of Odisha has demonstrated that both symptomatic and asymptomatic Indian patients could be positive for the SARS-CoV-2 genome in their fecal component. The findings have also established a protocol to collect and extract viral RNA for SARS-CoV-2 detection in fecal samples. Together, the study supports the hypothesis of possible fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus and provides a rationale to extend this study in a larger cohort of patient samples and correlate the significance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome detection in fecal samples with disease severity and transmission.
8835dcab677bd9b99cb9f75095332a92b53e1caa	Since the model is applied to a pandemic scenario with a short duration of the outbreak compared with the average life-time, we ignored the effects of inflow/outflow rates of birth and natural death on the dynamics of disease transmission. The subpopulations considered in the model include: A: asymptomatic infection with sensitive strain
72431b6decbbfe12d8b055b7fb20765d83c3b240	We consider measures that limit universal parallelism in computations of an alternating finite automaton (AFA). Maximum pared tree width counts the largest number of universal branches in any computation and acceptance width counts the number of universal branches in the best accepting computation, i.e., in the accepting computation with least universal parallelism. We give algorithms to decide whether the maximum pared tree width or the acceptance width of an AFA are bounded by an integer k. For a constant k the algorithm for maximum pared tree width operates in polynomial time. An AFA with m states and acceptance width k can be converted to an NFA with (m + 1) k states. We consider corresponding lower bounds for the transformation. The tree width of an AFA counts the number of all (existential and universal) branches of the computation. We give upper and lower bounds for converting an AFA of bounded tree width to a DFA.
fa8b3c172035dae58e0af964460e3623c0af72a4	 Our analysis was designed to explore the risks of influenza vaccination for cardiovascular and respiratory disease as well as all-cause mortality. Seventy four studies were included in our meta-analysis, and the results indicated that influenza vaccination can protect against morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as all-cause mortality. Such a preventative measure can benefit the general population as well as those in old age and with specific diseases. Background Influenza vaccination is a simple strategy recommended for the prevention of influenza infection and its complications. The meta-analysis aimed to provide current supportive evidence for the breadth and validity of the observed protective effects of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular and respiratory adverse outcomes and all-cause mortality in older adults and in general adult population. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify all published studies comparing influenza vaccination with placebo from the database inception to November 11, 2018. These included studies reporting the associations of influenza vaccination with the risk of aforementioned adverse outcomes. Results The pooled adjusted relative risks among influenza-vaccinated people relative to unvaccinated people for the outcomes of interest were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-0.78) for cardiovascular diseases (63 studies), 0.82 (95% CI = 0.75-0.91) for respiratory diseases (29 studies), and 0.57 (95% CI = 0.51-0.63) for all-cause mortality (43 studies). We performed subgroup analysis of age, gender, sex, and region/country and found that these protective effects were evident in the general adult population and particularly robust in older adults and in those with pre-existing specific diseases. Conclusion Influenza vaccine is associated with a significant risk reduction of cardiovascular and respiratory adverse outcomes as well as all-cause mortality. Such a preventative measure can benefit the general population as well as those in old age and with specific diseases. YGW proposed the overall design of the study.

7808ec7332ad540eefb4d33826764e46c1dd63c0	COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by human coronavirus (HCoV) SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and spread globally during 2020. Due to the difficulty of clinical decision-making during this period, our study group reviewed current literature focusing on the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. Despite the knowledge on this newly discovered virus which is constantly evolving, different pieces of evidence reported an association between COVID-19 and neurological symptoms like headache, dizziness, taste and smell disorders and complications involving the nervous system eventually triggered by the pathologic processes elicited by SARS-CoV-2. It seems that younger patients are less prone to develop severe forms of COVID-19. However, neurological signs have been reported in paediatric patients as well, and in some cases, the infection presented neurological sequelae. Furthermore, children with particular neurological diseases or treated with specific drugs (e.g. immune-suppressant therapies) must be carefully monitored during this pandemic. Neurologists should be aware of the main drug-drug interactions and the neurological side effects of COVID-19 treatments. Notably, adverse mental health impact has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2, which could be related either to the social strain or to the eventual neurotropic effects of the virus, which in other infections have been proven to promote the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Further, psychiatric population may be more vulnerable to the infection and at higher risk for adverse outcomes.
ad51af30326fcabf8b69e6ca813657af8259f474	China has made tremendous progress in advancing its national HIV program. Key to this progress was setting targets to motivate implementers to work effectively. Indicators were established using an iterative process with national stakeholders while also meeting international pressures. A plethora of demands may have distracted from ownership of the initial national program but, in the end, strengthened a focus on marginalized groups. China gradually relied less on donors and developed a uniquely Chinese HIV control program. The result was remarkable enlargement of prevention and treatment services that led to a reduction in mortality. Setting targets, and measuring performance against those targets, was vital to gauge continued progress and identify gaps in programing and implementation.
3f63eec9b3feb72f9a3ba9eb67e00111d24f4f12	COVID-19 pandemia is affecting Countries worldwide with a gendered death excess as being a male represents, especially in the 50-69 years age group, an unfavourable factor. Females are constitutionally prone to defend themselves against pathogens with a stronger efficiency than males. As a fact, several genes involved into the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune response are strategically placed on the X-chromosome and, among them, pathogenrelated receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor 7, suitable to recognize ssRNAs and trigger a gendered successful anti-viral fight. On the other hand, a more regulated IL-6 production and a more contained inflammation after the encounter of a pathogen supply score points in favour of the female sex in the view that an abnormal and exaggerated cytokine release does represent the hallmark of the deathful SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sex-prevalent expression of the attachment and permissive molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 further supports the concept of a male-oriented vulnerability. In this review, the possible role of biological and immunological sex differences into the higher morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 between females and males are discussed.
7ed39c40a69a5bddcb33ff78ba3373fc5b0df9a5	Background: Many countries have suspended kidney transplantation programs during the COVID-19 pandemic because of concerns for patient safety and the shortage of healthcare resources. This study aimed to describe patient, family member and potential donor perspectives on the suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programs due to COVID-19. We conducted seven online focus groups involving 31 adult kidney transplant candidates (n=22), caregivers (n=4) and potential donors (n=5). Transcripts were analyzed thematically. We identified five themes: cascading disappointments and devastation (with subthemes of shattering hope, succumbing to defeat, regret and guilt); helplessness and vulnerability (fear of declining health, confronted by the threat of and change in dialysis, disconnected from healthcare, susceptibility to infective complications); stress from uncertainty (confusion from conflicting information, unable to forward plan), exacerbating burdens (incurring extra financial costs, intensifying caregiver responsibilities), and sustaining health through the delay (protecting eligibility, relying on social support, adapting to emerging modalities of care). During the suspension of kidney transplantation programs, patients felt medically vulnerable because of declining health, susceptibility to infection and reduced access to care. There is a need to address health vulnerabilities, disappointment, uncertainty and additional burdens arising from the suspension of kidney transplantation programs. Accepted Article
024cf161374ba279acc9be1d5f810f983305b15a	The COVID-19 global pandemic is not even over yet but it has already taught us a lot of lessons -the hard way. The vast majority of the global community has blamed the Chinese Illegal wildlife markets for the origin of this pandemic. Through careful scientific analysis, I have explained in this article that we don't need such wildlife markets for these kinds of outbreaks to occur in the future. I have also explained how India which is the second-most populous country in the world, could be the origin of the next outbreak, even though such wildlife markets are either very rare or do not exist at all in India.
7a6e1e716a2b9327e8c21f8b6ba6a07736e6c085	The structures of snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) are proposed to be useful models to understand the structural and functional relationship of ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) which are membrane-anchored proteins involved in multiple human diseases. We have purified, sequenced and determined the structures of two new P-III SVMPs -atragin and kaouthiagin-like (K-like) from Naja atra. Atragin exhibits a known C-shaped topology, whereas K-like adopts an I-shaped conformation because of the distinct disulfide pattern in the disintegrin-like (D) domain. K-like exhibits an enzymatic specificity toward pro-TNFa with less inhibition of cell migration, but atragin shows the opposite effect. The specificity of the enzymatic activity is indicated to be dominated mainly by the local structures of SVMP in the metalloprotease (M) domain, whereas the hyper-variable region (HVR) in the cysteine-rich (C) domain is involved in a cell-migration activity. We demonstrate also a pH-dependent enzymatic activity of atragin that we correlate with the structural dynamics of a Zn 2+ -binding motif and the Met-turn based on the structures determined with a pH-jump method. The structural variations between the C-and I-shapes highlight the disulfide bond patterns in the D domain of the ADAM/adamalysin/reprolysins family proteins. Crown (C.-J.

17f35a46ab291451ffd3f2912c40a84f8d3179e7	The current pandemic of Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is continued to spread globally and no potential drug or vaccine against it is available. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 located on the envelope surface, involve in interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cell surface receptor, followed by entry into the host cell. Thereby, blocking the S glycoprotein through potential inhibitor may interfere its interaction with ACE2 and impede its entry into the host cell. Here, we present a truncated version of human ACE2 (tACE2), comprising the N terminus region of the intact ACE2 from amino acid position 21-119, involved in binding with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed the in-silico potential of tACE2 to compete with intact ACE2 for binding with RBD. The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2. Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in E. coli makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics. This is the first MD simulation based findings to provide a high affinity protein inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, an important target for drug designing against this unprecedented challenge. Figure 6 . Solubility prediction profile score of (A) intact ACE2 showing most of the residues in the window are below 0 (cyan) and À1 (red), while very few residues are above 1 (blue), favors insoluble expression for intact ACE2. (B) a large number of residues are between À1 and 1 (cyan), while a window of 7 residues at C-terminal are above 1 (blue), favoring total solubility score above 0, hence soluble expression for tACE2.

3f95cd9324e4e68dfac149200521e09981091feb	Interest in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and possibilities of its therapeutic modifications has soared over the last decade and more detailed knowledge specific to the canine microbiota at different mucosal sites including the gut is available. Probiotics, prebiotics or their combination (synbiotics) are a way of modifying the intestinal microbiota and exert effects on the host immune response. Probiotics are proposed to exert their beneficial effects through various pathways, for example production of antimicrobial peptides, enhancing growth of favourable endogenous microorganisms, competition for epithelial colonisation sites and immunemodulatory functions. Despite widespread use of pro-, pre-and synbiotics, scientific evidence of their beneficial effects in different conditions of the dog is scarce. Specific effects of different strains, their combination or their potential side-effects have not been evaluated sufficiently. In some instances, in vitro results have been promising, but could not be transferred consistently into in vivo situations. Specific canine gastrointestinal (GI) diseases or conditions where probiotics would be beneficial, their most appropriate dosage and application have not been assessed extensively. This review summarises the current knowledge of the intestinal microbiome composition in the dog and evaluates the evidence for probiotic use in canine GI diseases to date. It wishes to provide veterinarians with evidence-based information on when and why these products could be useful in preventing or treating canine GI conditions. It also outlines knowledge about safety and approval of commercial probiotic products, and the potential use of faecal microbial transplantation, as they are related to the topic of probiotic usage.
d1293cbb27aa58d9b629c26b3f413690701afc7f	Dear Editor-in-Chief: We have given two articles published recently in Science of the Total Environment by Mandal and Pal (2020) and Zambrano-Monserrate et al. (2020) a thorough reading. Both articles present a significant association between the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) social distancing policies and improvement in environmental quality such as air pollution, land surface temperature, and noise. Both articles present good research, complemented by detailed explanations and displays, yet we have a few concerns that affect the interpretation and meaning of the results. First, Mandal and Pal (2020) extracted Particulate Matter (PM), and land surface temperature from the Landsat 8 OLI images for the dates of 12-March-2020 as a representative of pre-lockdown time and 28-March-2020 and 13-April-2020 as the representative of ongoing lockdown periods. However, the authors did not provide detailed information on weather variables during those days which should have a direct impact on both land surface temperature and PM levels. Moreover, the cloud cover of the three Landsat 8 OLI images should be reported since cloud cover is well known to impact land surface temperature and can provide biased results (Lu et al., 2011) . Mandal and Pal (2020) and Zambrano-Monserrate et al. (2020) reported a dramatic reduction in the concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and PM with a diameter < 2.5 μm and <10 μm in some parts of the world, Zambrano-Monserrate et al. (2020) Figure 1, and Mandal and Pal (2020) Figures 2 and 3. However, there was not significant incorporation or discussion of the multiple factors that have an interdependent impact on how, and where, different levels of pollution are found. This omission makes it
cc89e35678f856eb6512f872785f1a0baf8ab901	Acute lung inflammation has severe morbidity, as seen in COVID-19 patients. Lung inflammation is accompanied or led by massive accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries ("margination"). We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils, and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils, while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure (e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein-conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP-like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs, illustrating translational potential. This work demonstrates that structure-dependent interactions with neutrophils can dramatically alter the biodistribution of nanoparticles, and NAPs have significant potential in detecting and treating respiratory conditions arising from injury or infections. * *
99912f5ad302540bb7d31491b0e361a2927e7ec5	As the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues worldwide, health care systems are facing increased demand with concurrent health care provider shortages. This increase in patient demand and potential for provider shortages is particularly apparent for palliative medicine, where there are already shortages in the provision of this care. In response to the developing pandemic, our Geriatrics and Palliative (GAP) Medicine team formulated a 2-team approach which includes triage algorithms for palliative consults as well as acute symptomatic management for both patients diagnosed with or under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. These algorithms provided a delineated set of guidelines to triage patients in need of palliative services and included provisions for acute symptoms management and the protection of both the patient care team and the families of patients with COVID-19. These guidelines helped with streamlining care in times of crisis, providing care to those in need, supporting frontline staff with primary-level palliative care, and minimizing the GAP team's risk of infection and burnout during the rapidly changing pandemic response.
7cc1fd43f6f552b87a1bdf4cac576b4be65919a6	The turnover of serotonin (5HT) was determined in the raphe area and cortex of mice infected with Pixuna, a strain of intermediate virulence of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEEV). NMRI-mice, 24 days old, were inoculated intracerebrally (ic) with 300 LDS0 of the virus. The animals were sacrificed 4, 7, 15,21,30, and 60 days postinoculation. 5HT and 5hydrodryindolacetic acid (SHIAA) in raphe and cortex were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Turnover rate of 5HT was determined by the administration of pargyline, p-chlorophenylalanine, and probenecid. The content of 5HT or SHIAA and 5HT/ 5HIAA ratios were not significantly different in infected compared with control mice. However, a decrease of 5HT turnover rate, determined after pargyline treatment, was observed in the raphe and not in the cortex of infected mice at 4 and 7 days after the inoculation. The turnover rate/(5HT)o in raphe is decreased in infected mice with signs of illness, suggesting a lower density of 5HT innervation in this brain area. The administration of p-chlorophenylalanine and probenecid showed that the cortex is also affected, but the synthesis is less modified than metabolism or elimination. Cell bodies of 5HT neurons seem to be more susceptible than projections to infection by Pixuna strain of VEEV.
b8957d48b6bcf17b7b51e004d19314ce77f653a1	Background: During the initial containment phase of influenza A/H1N1 2009, close contacts of cases were traced to provide antiviral prophylaxis within 48 h after exposure and to alert them on signs of disease for early diagnosis and treatment. Passengers seated on the same row, two rows in front or behind a patient infectious for influenza, during a flight of ≥ 4 h were considered close contacts. This study evaluates the timeliness of flight-contact tracing (CT) as performed following national and international CT requests addressed to the Center of Infectious Disease Control (CIb/RIVM), and implemented by the Municipal Health Services of Schiphol Airport. Methods: Elapsed days between date of flight arrival and the date passenger lists became available (contact details identified -CI) was used as proxy for timeliness of CT. In a retrospective study, dates of flight arrival, onset of illness, laboratory diagnosis, CT request and identification of contacts details through passenger lists, following CT requests to the RIVM for flights landed at Schiphol Airport were collected and analyzed. Results: 24 requests for CT were identified. Three of these were declined as over 4 days had elapsed since flight arrival. In 17 out of 21 requests, contact details were obtained within 7 days after arrival (81%). The average delay between arrival and CI was 3,9 days (range 2-7), mainly caused by delay in diagnosis of the index patient after arrival (2,6 days). In four flights (19%), contacts were not identified or only after > 7 days. CI involving Dutch airlines was faster than non-Dutch airlines (P < 0,05). Passenger locator cards did not improve timeliness of CI. In only three flights contact details were identified within 2 days after arrival. Conclusion: CT for influenza A/H1N1 2009 among flight passengers was not successful for timely provision of prophylaxis. CT had little additional value for alerting passengers for disease symptoms, as this information already was provided during and after the flight. Public health authorities should take into account patient delays in seeking medical advise and laboratory confirmation in relation to maximum time to provide postexposure prophylaxis when deciding to install contact tracing measures. International standardization of CT guidelines is recommended.
93fa673da48e258db5dc4560b84b8291e3a26b8c	Epidemiology Model Effective reproduction number a b s t r a c t Since it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia. Little is known about its epidemiology. We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve. We estimate the basic reproduction number R 0 of SARS virus is 2.87 in mainland of China, very close to the estimations in Singapore and Hong Kong.
45941ed8f762dc103b0d583b7e4e349be1ef6341	Collectively the evidence obtained from across five clinical studies involving 936 adults indicate that mono-herbal preparations of Sambucus nigra L. berry (S.nigra), when taken within 48 hours of onset of acute respiratory viral infection, may reduce the duration and severity of common cold and influenza symptoms in adults. There is currently no evidence to support the use of S.nigra berry for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Given the body of evidence from preclinical studies demonstrating the antiviral effects of S.nigra berry, alongside the results from clinical studies included in this review, further pre-clinical research exploring the potential role of S.nigra berry for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 infection is encouraged.

a301e1d153e21491970918fc5a9d556e888b1bb1	a b s t r a c t Background: and Aims; To investigate the association between use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) and outcomes of hypertensive COVID-19 patients, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EuropePMC, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central Databases using the terms "(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme OR angiotensin receptor blocker)". The primary and second outcomes were mortality (non-survivor) and severe COVID-19, respectively. Results: Totally, 7410 patients were included from 15 studies. Pooled analysis showed that the use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with mortality (OR 0.73 [0.38, 1.40], p ¼ 0.34; I 2 : 81%) and severity (OR 1.03 [0.73, 1.45], p ¼ 0.87; I 2 : 65%). Pooled adjusted OR showed no risk/benefit associated with ACEI/ARB use in terms of mortality (OR 0.83 [0.54, 1.27], p ¼ 0.38; I 2 : 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the use of ARB was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.51 [0.29, 0.90], p ¼ 0.02; I 2 : 22%) but not ACEI subgroup (OR 0.68 [0.39, 1.17], p ¼ 0.16; I 2 : 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association between ACEI/ARB use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 do not varies by gender (p ¼ 0.104). GRADE showed a very low certainty of evidence for effect of ACEI/ARB on mortality and severity. The certainty of evidence was very low for both ACEI and ARB subgroups. Conclusion: Administration of a renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, was not associated with increased mortality or severity of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. Specifically, ARB and not ACEI use, was associated with lower mortality.
b7014b42c5e0ba5b581c2d49b2b099e40f1270f5	Background: Human respiratory syncytial virus usually causes self-limiting upper respiratory infection and occasionally causes pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Respiratory syncytial virus-induced severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome in immunocompetent adults has been rarely described. Unfortunately, optimal treatment has not been established for this potentially fatal condition. We report a case of respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome occurring in a previously healthy man successfully treated with orally administered ribavirin. Case presentation: An 81-year-old previously healthy Korean man presented with cough, dyspnea, and febrile sensation. He had hypoxemia with diffuse ground glass opacity evident on chest radiography, which progressed and required mechanical ventilation. All microbiological tests were negative except multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using respiratory specimen, which was positive for human adenovirus. Under the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, orally administered ribavirin was administered and he recuperated completely without complications. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the potential usefulness of orally administered ribavirin as a therapeutic option for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, at least in an immunocompetent host.
4dd75f2cd80aa8704156923f916dd338bb88ab9b	This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) to distinguish bacterial from viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and to identify severe cases in children hospitalized for radiologically confirmed CAP. Index test results were compared with those derived from routine diagnostic tests, i.e., white blood cell (WBC) counts, neutrophil percentages, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels. This prospective, multicenter study was carried out in the most important children's hospitals (n = 11) in Italy and 433 otherwise healthy children hospitalized for radiologically confirmed CAP were enrolled. Among cases for whom etiology could be determined, CAP was ascribed to bacteria in 235 (54.3%) children and to one or more viruses in 111 (25.6%) children. A total of 312 (72.2%) children had severe disease. CRP and PCT had the best performances for both bacterial and viral CAP identification. The cut-off values with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity for the identification of bacterial and viral infections using CRP were !7.98 mg/L and 7.5 mg/L, respectively. When PCT was considered, the cut-off values with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity were !0.188 ng/mL for bacterial CAP and 0.07 ng/mL for viral CAP. For the identification of severe cases, the best results were obtained with evaluations of PCT and MR-proANP. However, in both cases, the biomarker cut-off with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity (!0.093 ng/mL for PCT and !33.8 pmol/L for proANP) had a relatively good sensitivity (higher than 70%) but a limited specificity (of approximately 55%). This study indicates that in children with CAP, sTREM-1, MR-proANP, and MR-proADM blood levels have poor abilities to differentiate bacterial from viral diseases or to identify severe cases, highlighting that PCT maintains the main role at this regard.

e0190db5a1a1b99c8f3f2a7454dc698d840817bf	Many researches indicate human respiration flow and background ventilation are two important aspects leading to possible respiratory disease spread. However, current studies on respiration flow and the resulted exhaled pollutant dispersion are limited, because different head postures, respiration mode, breath rate, room ventilation and so on, can exert profound impacts that are not understood very clearly. To evaluate the role of head postures on transmission of human exhaled pollutants, this study uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to study the exhalation flow of a sitting adult in a calm indoor office. Four different head postures are considered: sitting upright viewing front, sitting upright but head tilted viewing upward, sitting upright but head turned viewing the lateral, and sitting but pillowing head on a table. Based on the decay percentage of a gas concentration, the impacted scope of expired air is identified. The common posture by sitting upright viewing front is selected to investigate the change of impacted scope with increasing exhalation rates. The experimental test is also carried out using a breathing thermal manikin. This study finds out that the impacted scope of expired air under different head postures is different. The horizontal impacted distance is highly dependent on the specified threshold concentration. If a person sits around at a table and makes a deep exhalation, other people shall be apart from him/her with a larger distance to be free from the exhaled pollutant exposure, once his/her thermal plume is blocked by the table.
3835bc7fd6dc558f3005f3763cc5a78376eebc17	25 Background: Understanding viral infection of the olfactory epithelium is essential because 26 smell loss can occur with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute 27 respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and because the olfactory nerve is an 28 important route of entry for viruses to the central nervous system. Specialized chemosensory 29 epithelial cells that express the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 30 (TRPM5) are found throughout the airways and intestinal epithelium and are involved in 31 responses to viral infection. 32 Results: Herein we performed deep transcriptional profiling of olfactory epithelial cells sorted 33 by flow cytometry based on the expression of fluorescent protein markers for olfactory sensory 34 neurons and TRPM5 in the mouse (Mus musculus). We find profuse expression of transcripts 35 involved in inflammation, immunity and viral infection in TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells 36 and olfactory sensory neurons. These cells express the Tmprss2 transcript that encodes for a 37 serine protease that primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein before entry into host cells. Intranasal 38 infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) elicited a decrease in olfactory sensory 39 neurons. 40 Conclusion: Our study provides new insights into a potential role for TRPM5-expressing cells in 41 viral infection of the olfactory epithelium. We find that, as found for solitary chemosensory cells 42 (SCCs) and brush cells in the airway epithelium, and for tuft cells in the intestine, the 43 transcriptome of TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells and olfactory sensory neurons indicates 44 that they are likely involved in the inflammatory response elicited by viral infection of the 45 olfactory epithelium. 46
3cdd796716a278cfcd72063a717c6907b9302e45	G-coupled protein receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest class of druggable targets. Signaling by GPCRs is initiated from subcellular hot spots including the plasma membrane, signalosomes and endosomes to contribute to vascular inflammation. GPCR-G protein signaling at the plasma membrane causes endothelial barrier disruption and also cross-talks with growth factor receptors to promote proinflammatory signaling. A second surge of GPCR signaling is initiated by cytoplasmic NFκB activation mediated by β-arrestins and CARMA-Bcl10-MALT1 signalosomes. Once internalized, ubiquitinated GPCRs initiate signaling from endosomes via assembly of the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase binding protein-1 (TAB1)-TAB2-p38 MAPK complex to promote vascular inflammation. Understanding the complexities of GPCR signaling is critical for development of new strategies to treat vascular inflammation such as that associated with COVID-19.
09ee74a630587010f95296fec1f79b8b64ff2e09	C12, an attenuated, fusion delayed, very weakly hepatotropic mutant of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) has been further characterized. We have previously shown that C12 has two amino acid substitutions relative to wild type virus in the spike protein, Q159L (within a region of S1 shown to bind to viral receptor in an in vitro assay) and H716D (in the proteolytic cleavage recognition site). We have sequenced the rest of the 31-kb genome of C12 and compared it to wild type virus. Only three additional amino acids substitutions were found, all encoded within the replicase gene. Analysis of C12 in vivo in C57Bl/6 mice has shown that despite the fact that this virus replicates in the brain to titers at least as high as wild type and causes acute encephalitis similar to wild type, this virus causes a minimal level of demyelination and only at very high levels of virus inoculation. Thus acute encephalitis is not sufficient for the induction of demyelination by MHV-A59. Analysis of mutants isolated at earlier times from the same persistently infected glial cell culture as C12, as well as mutants isolated from a second independent culture of persistently infected glial cells, suggests that both the weakly demyelinating and the weakly hepatotropic phenotypes of C12 are associated with the Q159L amino acid substitution. ᭧ 1997 Academic Press 1 Present address: Department of Molecular Virology, Baylor College tation and loss of hepatotropism was demonstrated by of Medicine, Houston, TX. the analysis of other mutants isolated from persistently 2 To whom reprint requests should be addressed.

4295245546f258d90caf737fd52297ce340bc712	The pandemic caused by has been an unprecedented social and health emergency worldwide. This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.
d67b69718d53a8948267721cf8db8e32a45a30f0	Data association is one of the main tasks to achieve in perception applications. Its aim is to match the sensor detections to the known objects. To treat such issue, recent research focus on the evidential approach using belief functions, which are interpreted as an extension of the probabilistic model for reasoning about uncertainty. The data fusion process begins by quantifying sensor data by belief masses. Thereafter, these masses are combined in order to provide more accurate information. Finally, a probabilistic approximation of these combined masses is done to make-decision on associations. Several probabilistic transformations have been proposed in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, these transformations have been evaluated only on simulated examples. For this reason, the objective of this paper is to benchmark most of interesting probabilistic transformations on real-data in order to evaluate their performances for the autonomous vehicle perception problematic.

Introducción-objetivos: Vivimos tiempos excepcionales inmersos en la pandemia causada por el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV2. Aunque tanto la afectación clínica pediátrica como de pacientes con cardiopatías congénitas son infrecuentes, la atención prioritaria de los adultos COVID-19 prácticamente ha colapsado nuestro sistema sanitario. En consecuencia, toda actividad habitual se ha minimizado durante este período. En este trabajo analizamos la reducción de nuestra cirugía de CC durante estos 2-meses de estado de alerta sanitaria y proponemos estrategias de vuelta a la normalidad. Métodos: Desde el grupo de trabajo de cardiopatías congénitas de nuestra Sociedad se realizó una encuesta en los servicios de congénitas de nuestro país para conocer la disminución de actividad causada por la pandemia COVID-19 en el período temporal del 13-Marzo hasta el 13-Mayo-2020. Resultados: Durante la pandemia se ha disminuido parcialmente la cirugía de congénitas, interviniéndose los casos más urgentes y reduciéndose al mínimo la actividad programada. Respecto al mismo período del año anterior, se ha operado 51% menos cirugía mayor y 54% menos extracorpóreas. La colaboración en la atención directa de adultos COVID-19 ha sido del 15%, con 7% de nuestros cirujanos de baja. Antes de operar a cualquier paciente solicitamos PCR para descartar infección por SARS-CoV2, y si esta es positiva sólo consideramos intervención en los casos urgentes/emergentes. La pandemia del SARS-CoV2 ha obligado a todos los servicios de congénitas del país a reestructurarse para apoyar a los compañeros con tratamiento directo del COVID-19, sin mermar la atención de nuestros propios pacientes cuya cirugía no podía demorarse. ABSTRACT We live in exceptional times caused by the new SARS-CoV2 coronavirus pandemic. Although clinical involvement of children and patients with congenital heart disease are not frequent, the emergency care of adults with COVID-19 has almost collapsed our healthcare system. Consequently, the whole standard activity has been minimized during this period. In this manuscript we analyse the reduction of our congenital heart surgery over these 2 months of state of alarm, and we propose strategies to return to normal. Methods: From our Society congenital heart disease working group, a survey was carried out in Spanish congenital heart disease surgery hospitals, in order to find out the decrease in activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the time period from March-13 to May-13, 2020. Results: During the pandemic, congenital heart disease surgery was partially reduced, stepping with the most urgent cases and minimizing the scheduled activity. Compared to the same period in 2019, 51% less major surgery and 54% less extracorporeal surgery were performed. Collaboration in adults COVID-19 front line care has been 15%, having 7% of our specialists on quarantine. Before operating on any patient, the PCR is asked to rule out SARS-CoV2 infection and, if positive, we only consider intervention in urgent / emergency cases. The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has forced all the congenital heart disease services nationwide to restructure, aiming to support colleagues with direct treatment of COVID-19, without sacrificing the healthcare of our own patients whose surgery could not be delayed.

e804cd4b6a076e2a2d1a83b862664ee9190686bc	Online queries were compared with the number of new COVID-19 cases and tests. Time series 26 trends and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients showed that the number of COVID-19-27 related queries in South Korea increased during the local and international events; higher in 28 women, certain age groups; and higher in affected areas, which represented the community 29 health risk perception. Greater correlations were found in mobile searches compared to that of 30 desktop searches, indicating the changing behavior in searching health online information. The 31 use of both Google and NAVER RSV to explore the patterns of community health risk 32 perception could be beneficial for targeting risk communication in several perspectives including 33 time, population characteristics, and location. 34
eed5a0cc4fc05708047a6bd4627aac5cf5fdc59f	Induction of pro-inflammatory response is a crucial cellular process that detects and controls the invading viruses at early stages of the infection. Along with other innate immunity, this nonspecific response would either clear the invading viruses or allow the adaptive immune system to establish an effective antiviral response at late stages of the infection. The objective of this study was to characterize cellular mechanisms exploited by coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to regulate the induction of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, at the transcriptional level. The results showed that IBV infection of cultured human and animal cells activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and induced the expression of IL-6 and IL-8. Meanwhile, IBV has developed a strategy to counteract the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 by inducing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), a negative regulator of the p38 MAPK, in order to limit the production of an excessive amount of IL-6 and IL-8 in the infected cells. As activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and induction of IL-6 and IL-8 may have multiple pathogenic effects on the whole host as well as on individual infected cells, regulation of the p38 MAPK and DUSP1 feedback loop by IBV may modulate the pathogenesis of the virus.
cccc79beb9b80834fd6302ddec0eb65633ce3f95	Although generally safe and effective, severe perioperative complications, including cardiac arrest, may occur during general anesthesia in infants. With the emergence of evidence that specific anesthetic agents may affect future neurocognitive outcomes, there has been an increased focus on alternatives to general anesthesia, including spinal anesthesia. We present a case of cardiac arrest during general anesthesia in an infant who required urologic surgery. During the subsequent anesthetic care, spinal anesthesia was offered as an alternative to general anesthesia. The risks of severe perioperative complications during general anesthesia are reviewed, etiologic factors for such events are presented, and the use of spinal anesthesia as an alternative to general anesthesia is discussed.
2b10c237281a6e5d61e8fff995dc8920465eda56	Background: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are classified into high-risk HPV and low-risk HPV. The most common high-risk HPV types in cervical cancer are HPV 16 and 18, and the most common low-risk types causing genital warts are HPV 6 and HPV 11. In this study, applying novel AllGlo fluorescent probes, we established a quadruplex quantitative PCR method to simultaneously detect and differentiate HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 in a single tube. The specificity, the sensitivity, the detection limit, the reproducibility and the standard curve of this method were examined. Finally, clinical samples that had been tested previously by TaqMan PCR and HPV GenoArray (GA) test were used to verify the accuracy and sensitivity of the method. The assay has a sensitivity of 10 1 to 10 2 copies/test and a linear detection range from 10 1 to 10 8 copies/test. The mean amplification efficiencies for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 were 0.97, 1.10, 0.93 and 1.20, respectively, and the mean correlation coefficient (r 2 ) of each standard curve was above 0.99 for plasmid templates ranging from 10 3 to 10 7 copies/test. There was 100% agreement between the AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR, HPV GA test and TaqMan uniplex qPCR methods. Conclusions: AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR in a single tube has the advantages of relatively high throughput, good reproducibility, high sensitivity, high specificity, and a wide linear range of detection. The convenient single tube format makes this assay a powerful tool for the studies of mixed infections by multiple pathogens, viral typing and viral load quantification.
ca8ba837a168f4d338164c85034015392fbc5e70	An investigation of the presence of inXuenza A virus has been conducted in king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at the Possession Island in the Crozet Archipelago, Antarctica, using a rapid molecular diagnostic method based on real-time polymerase chain reaction. No evidence of outbreak or positive viral infection of inXuenza A virus was found in this study. We however recommend the implementation of long-term surveillance in seabird populations of polar ecosystems to detect the potential introduction of exotic strains and potential existence of a local epidemiological cycle for avian inXuenza viruses.
6e95a69f48c5d841906b055e7476574665004f9a	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus infectious disease has become a pandemic. Social (physical) distancing is a key non-pharmacologic control measure to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2, but high-level adherence is needed. Using daily travel distance and stay-at-home time derived from large-scale anonymous mobile phone location data provided by Descartes Labs and SafeGraph, we quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates have been followed in the U.S. and its effect on growth of COVID-19 cases. The correlation between the COVID-19 growth rate and travel distance decay rate and dwell time at home change rate was -0.586 (95% CI: -0.742∼-0.370) and 0.526 (95% CI: 0.293∼0.700), 1 arXiv:2004.11430v1 [cs.SI] 23 Apr 2020 respectively. Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.04∼6.86 days to 3.66∼30.29 days after social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with mechanistic epidemic prediction models. Social distancing mandates reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are followed.
3007489c6714d99d180ce21a212f51bdd9dd709e	Many emerging and reemerging viruses, such as rabies, SARS, Marburg, and Ebola have bat populations as disease reservoirs. Understanding the spillover from bats to humans and other animals, and the associated health risks requires an analysis of the disease dynamics in bat populations. Traditional compartmental epizootic models, which are relatively easy to implement and analyze, usually impose unrealistic aggregation assumptions about disease-related structure and depend on parameters that frequently are not measurable in field conditions. We propose a novel combination of computational and adaptive modeling approaches that address the maintenance of emerging diseases in bat colonies through individual (intra-host) models of the response of the host to a viral challenge. The dynamics of the individual models are used to define survival, susceptibility and transmission conditions relevant to epizootics as well as to develop and parametrize models of the disease evolution into uniform and diverse populations. Applications of the proposed approach to modeling the effects of immunological heterogeneity on the dynamics of bat rabies are presented.

Therefore, protein-NP interactions should be closely explored to understand and modulate the nature of NPs in medical implementations. This review focuses mainly on the physicochemical parameters such as dimension, surface chemistry, morphology of NPs, and influence of pH on the formation of protein corona and conformational changes of adsorbed proteins by different kinds of techniques. Also, the impact of protein corona on the colloidal stability of NPs is discussed. Uncontrolled protein attachment on NPs may bring unwanted impacts such as protein denaturation and aggregation. In contrast, controlled protein adsorption by optimal concentration, size, pH, and surface modification of NPs may result in potential implementation of NPs as therapeutic agents especially for disaggregation of amyloid fibrils. Also, the effect of NPs-protein corona on reducing the cytotoxicity and clinical implications such as drug delivery, cancer therapy, imaging and diagnosis will be discussed. Validated correlative physicochemical parameters for NP-protein corona formation frequently derived from protein corona fingerprints of NPs which are more valid than the parameters obtained only on the base of NP features. This review may provide useful information regarding the potency as well as the adverse effects of NPs to predict their behavior in vivo.
e2e24b371002ae84f05ed7ec76ad923a2a90f573	Envelope glycoprotein E of flaviviruses is exposed at the surface of the virion, and is responsible for eliciting a neutralizing antibody (Ab) response, as well as protective immunity in the host. In this report, we describe a method for the fine mapping of a linear sequence of the E protein of dengue virus type-2 (DEN-2), recognized by a type-specific and neutralizing monoclonal Ab (mAb), 3H5. First, an Escherichia coli expression vector containing a heat-inducible A PL promoter was used to synthesize several truncated, and near-full length E polypeptides. Reactivities of these polypeptides with polyclonal mouse hyperimmune sera, as well as the 3H5 mAb revealed the location of the 3H5-binding site to be within a region of 166 amino acids (aa) between aa 255 and 422. For fine mapping, a series oi" targeted deletions were made inframe within this region using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hydrophilicity pattern of this region was used as a guide to systematically delete the regions encoding the various groups of surface aa residues within the context of a near-full-length E polypeptide by using PCR. The 3H5-binding site was thus precisely mapped to a region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 and 397). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence was able to bind to the 3H5 mAb specifically, as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we show that rabbit Abs raised against the synthetic peptide of 12 aa were able to bind to the authentic E protein, and to neutralize DEN-2 virus in a plaque reduction assay.

7c299b1c2f8c81470a9356c21280b07fb5835191	In vivo and ex vivo models of reoviral encephalitis were utilized to delineate the contribution of type I interferon (IFN) to the host's defense against local central nervous system (CNS) viral infection and systemic viral spread. Following intracranial (i.c.) inoculation with either serotype 3 (T3) or serotype 1 (T1) reovirus, increased expression of IFN-α, IFN-β, and myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx1; a prototypical IFN stimulated gene) was observed in mouse brain tissue. Type I IFN receptor deficient mice (IFNAR −/− ) had accelerated lethality, compared to wildtype (B6wt) controls, following i.c. T1 or T3 challenge. Although viral titers in the brain and eyes of reovirus infected IFNAR −/− mice were significantly increased, these mice did not develop neurologic signs or brain injury. In contrast, increased reovirus titers in peripheral tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and blood) of IFNAR −/− mice were associated with severe intestinal and liver injury. These results suggest that reovirus-infected IFNAR −/− mice succumb to peripheral disease rather than encephalitis per se. To investigate the potential role of type I IFN in brain tissue, brain slice cultures (BSCs) were prepared from IFNAR −/− mice and B6wt controls for ex vivo T3 reovirus
fc44cb8d99bd942116d034281850d1b8b45766be	An autonomous deterministic non-linear epidemic model SEQIHRS is proposed for the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease with quarantine and isolation control strategies in a community with pre-existing immunity. The model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free and a unique endemic equilibrium. The existence and local stability of the disease free and endemic equilibria are explored in terms of the effective reproduction number R C . It is observed that media coverage does not affect the effective reproduction number, but it helps to mitigate disease burden by lowering the number of infectious individuals at the endemic steady state and also lowering the infection peak. A new approach is proposed to estimate the coefficient of media coverage. Using the results of central manifold theory, it is established that as R C passes through unity, transcritical bifurcation occurs in the system and the unique endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable. It is observed that the population level impact of quarantine and isolation depend on the level of transmission by the isolated individuals. Moreover, the higher level of pre-existing immunity in the population decreases the infection peak and causes its early arrival. Theoretical findings are supported by numerical simulation. Sensitivity analysis is performed for R C and state variables at endemic steady state with respect to model parameters.
dac97ed105558c9c4069c0a54b1381b19a5e051d	Document stores are frequently used as representation format in many applications. It is often necessary to transform a set of data stored in a relational database (RDB) into a document store. There are several approaches that execute such translation. However, it is difficult to evaluate which target document structure is the most appropriate. In this article, we present a set of query-based metrics for evaluating and comparing documents schemas against a set of existing queries, that represent the application access pattern. We represent the target document schema and the queries as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), which are used to calculate the metrics. The metrics allow to evaluate if a given target document schema is adequate to answer the queries. We performed a set of experiments to calculate the metrics over a set of documents produced by existing transformation solutions. The metric results are related with smaller coding effort, showing that the metrics are effective to guide the choice of a target NoSQL document structure.
e64e90c564dca9649d2c2659767a23d00cfd694d	We describe here the metagenomics-derived viral sequences detected in beef, pork, and chicken purchased from stores in San Francisco. In beef we detected four previously reported viruses (two parvoviruses belonging to different genera, an anellovirus, and one circovirus-like virus) and one novel bovine polyomavirus species (BPyV2-SF) whose closest relatives infect primates. Detection of porcine hokovirus in beef indicated that this parvovirus can infect both ungulate species. In pork we detected four known parvoviruses from three genera, an anellovirus, and pig circovirus 2. Chicken meat contained numerous gyrovirus sequences including those of chicken anemia virus and of a novel gyrovirus species (GyV7-SF). Our results provide an initial characterization of some of the viruses commonly found in US store-bought meats which included a diverse group of parvoviruses and viral families with small circular DNA genomes. Whether any of these viruses can infect humans will require testing human sera for specific antibodies.
de0f6068db445e97a5b1fe20b91f517dbf57658a	This technical study describes all-atom modeling and simulation of a fully-glycosylated fulllength SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in a viral membrane. First, starting from PDB:6VSB and 6VXX, full-length S protein structures were modeled using template-based modeling, de-novo protein structure prediction, and loop modeling techniques in GALAXY modeling suite. Then, using the recently-determined most occupied glycoforms, 22 N-glycans and 1 O-glycan of each monomer were modeled using Glycan Reader & Modeler in CHARMM-GUI. These fullyglycosylated full-length S protein model structures were assessed and further refined against the low-resolution data in their respective experimental maps using ISOLDE. We then used CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder to place the S proteins in a viral membrane and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. All structures are available in CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 Archive (http://www.charmm-gui.org/docs/archive/covid19), so researchers can use these models to carry out innovative and novel modeling and simulation research for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
36ef3f2311e1e774eb16d5e27e4b0ccb3f50e3a8	The dwindling wildlife species of our planet have become a cause célèbre for conservation groups, governments, and concerned citizens throughout the world. The application of powerful new genetic technologies to surviving populations of threatened mammals has revolutionized our ability to recognize hidden perils that afflict them. We have learned new lessons of survival, adaptation, and evolution from viewing the natural history of genomes in hundreds of detailed studies. A single case history of one species, the African cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, is here reviewed to reveal a long-term story of conservation challenges and action informed by genetic discoveries and insights. A synthesis of 3 decades of data, interpretation, and controversy, capped by whole genome sequence analysis of cheetahs, provides a compelling tale of conservation relevance and action to protect this species and other threatened wildlife.
c0f102738445b0a4c2af4323fe69d319d9e09eda	OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of seasonal distribution of active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the influences of meteorological factors including temperature and humidity on active systemic lupus erythematosus. The characteristics of seasonal distribution of active SLE and its correlation with meteorological factors were retrospectively analyzed in 640 patients living in the city of Zhanjiang, China and had active SLE between January 1997 and December 2006. In winter, when there are weaker ultraviolet (UV) rays, the ratio of patients with active SLE to total inpatients was 3.89 ø, which is significantly higher than in other seasons with stronger UV rays, including 2.17 ø in spring, 1.87 ø in summer and 2.12 ø in autumn. The number of patients with active SLE had significant negative correlation with mean temperature and was not significantly related to mean humidity. CONCLUSION: Active SLE has the characteristics of seasonal distribution and is associated with temperature. The mechanism remains to be further studied.

The interaction of integrins with their ligands or their expression in different tissues and cells may be considered as potential therapeutic targets. These class of therapeutic agents has already been developed for the treatment of oncologic and chronic inflammatory diseases making possible treatments readily available if proven effective. Of additional interest is the use of molecules able to interfere with cytokines production, 9 as these biomolecules are responsible for the modulation of integrin expression. 10-15 Our conclusion is that further investigation into any possible links between integrin-binding peptides and their correlation with coronavirus infectivity and diffusion are needed, especially considering that their possible inhibition could be a potential therapeutic target for the SARS-COV-2 infection.
ad0e1655fb72944f4c39e0a527fe46a5e29cc368	Technologies required for strategic actionable net-centric biological defense systems consist of : 1) multiplexed multi-array sensors for threat agents and for signatures of the host response to infection; 2) novel vaccines and restricted access antivirals/bacterials to reduce emergence of drug resistant strains pre-and post-event; 3) telemedicine capabilities to deliver post-event care to 20,000 victims of a biological strike; and 4) communication systems with intelligent software for resource allocation and redundant pathways that survive catastrophic attack. The integrated system must detect all threat agents with minimal false positive/negative events, a seamless integrated broad-band communications capability that enables conversion of data to actionable information, and novel pre-and post-event treatments. The development of multiplexed multi-array sensors, appropriate vaccines and antibiotics, and integrated communication capabilities are critical to sustaining normal health, commerce, and international activities. A decision making component is required for coordinating the delivery of actionable information. Figure 1 illustrates such a flow chart. In threat situations, data developed from sensor arrays, surveillance systems, and therapeutics inventories can be electronically encrypted and transmitted via intelligent communication networks to decision makers for appropriate actions. The decision makers include individuals, government authority, medical care experts (doctors, hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], etc.), and the military.
b9a91b75c9af11d4a0ff670b1c0ce1a26d7c8470	Trading off some accuracy for better performances in scientific computing is an appealing approach to ease the exploration of various alternatives on complex simulation models. Existing approaches involve the application of either time-consuming model reduction techniques or resource-demanding statistical approaches. Such requirements prevent any opportunistic model exploration, e.g., exploring various scenarios on environmental models. This limits the ability to analyse new models for scientists, to support trade-off analysis for decision-makers and to empower the general public towards informed environmental intelligence. In this paper, we present a new approximate computing technique, aka. loop aggregation, which consists in automatically reducing the main loop of a simulation model by aggregating the corresponding spatial or temporal data. We apply this approximate scientific computing approach on a geophysical model of a hydraulic simulation with various input data. The experimentation demonstrates the ability to drastically decrease the simulation time while preserving acceptable results with a minimal set-up. We obtain a median speed-up of 95.13% and up to 99.78% across all the 23 case studies.
6517a1975c1b489df8dcf33f24426a6e298c8fb6	The COVID-19 pandemic has created huge damage to society and brought panic around the world. Such panic can be ascribed to the seemingly deceptive features of COVID-19: Compared to other deadly viral outbreaks, it has medium transmission and mortality rates. As a result, the severity of the causative coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was deeply underestimated by society at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on this, in this review, we define the viruses with features similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 as the Panic Zone viruses. To contain those viruses, accurate and fast diagnosis followed by effective isolation and treatment of patients are pivotal at the early stage of virus breakouts. This is especially true when there is no cure or vaccine available for a transmissible disease, which is the case for the current COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 2020, more than 100 kits for COVID-19 diagnosis on the market have been surveyed in this review, while emerging sensing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed. It is of critical importance to rationally use these kits for efficient management and control of the Panic Zone viruses. Therefore, we discuss guidelines to select diagnostic kits at different outbreak stages of the Panic Zone viruses, SARS-CoV-2 in particular. While it is of utmost importance to use nucleic acid based detection kits with low false negativity (high sensitivity) at the early stage of an outbreak, the low false positivity (high specificity) gains importance at later stages of the outbreak. When society is set to reopen from the lockdown stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critical to have immunoassay based kits with high specificity to identify people who can safely return to society after their recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Finally, since a massive attack from a viral pandemic requires a massive defense from the whole society, we urge both government and the private sector to research and develop affordable and reliable point-of-care testing (POCT) kits, which can be used massively by the general public (and therefore called massive POCT) to contain Panic Zone viruses in the future.
c2980e78d86dd24ace4bd85e2dd0d1e82cf1854f	Background: Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, thousands of patients with fever or cough were flocked into fever clinic of designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. To date, no data have ever been reported to reflect the prevalence of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among these outpatients. Moreover, it is almost unknown to discriminate COVID-19 and nucleic acid negative patients based on clinical features in the fever clinics. The infectious status of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated among the outpatients. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared between COVID-19 and nucleic acid negative patients. The nucleic acid positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 in the outpatients from our fever clinic was 67·1%, while the majority of COVID-19 patients were mild cases. The predominant initial symptom in those COVID-19 patients was fever (78.2%), followed by cough (15.6%). Very significantly lower number of eosinophils was characterized in COVID-19 patients as compared to that of nucleic acid negative patients. More importantly, the proportion of subjects with eosinophil counts lower than normal levels in COVID-19 patients was much higher than that of nucleic acid negative patients. Fever combined with bilateral groundglass opacities in CT imaging and eosinophil count below the normal level are probably a valuable indicator of COVID-19 infection in those outpatients. States that are facing the same situation as Wuhan experienced, and could be valuable to prevent those nucleic acid negative patients from misdiagnosis before antibody testing.
c0c0b582642ee5c8638d8d5961a15d4b71996764	SARS-CoV-2 dramatically revealed the sudden impact of respiratory viruses in our lives. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and an important burden on healthcare systems worldwide, especially in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to identify severity predictors in the oldest-old admitted with influenza and/or RSV infections. This is a multicenter, retrospective study of all oldest-old patients (≥ 85 years old) admitted for laboratory-confirmed influenza and/or RSV infection in three tertiary hospitals in Portugal, Italy, and Cyprus over two consecutive winter seasons. The outcomes included the following: pneumonia on infection presentation, use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and in-hospital death (IHD). The association with possible predictors, including clinical features and type of virus infection, was assessed using uni-and multivariable analyses. A total of 251 oldest-old patients were included in the study. Pneumonia was evident in 32.3% (n = 81). NIV was implemented in 8.8% (n = 22), and IHD occurred in 13.9% (n = 35). Multivariable analyses revealed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma was associated with pneumonia (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.02-3.43; p = 0.045). COPD or asthma (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.67-11.6; p = 0.003), RSV (OR 3.12; 95% CI 1.09-8.92; p = 0.023), and influenza B infections (OR 3.77; 95% CI 1.06-13.5; p = 0.041) were associated with NIV use, respectively, while chronic kidney disease was associated with IHD (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.14-5.51; p = 0.023). Among the oldest-old, chronic organ failure, such as COPD or asthma, and CKD predicted pneumonia and IHD, respectively, beyond the importance of viral virulence itself. These findings could impact on public health policies, such as fostering influenza immunization campaigns, home-based care programs, and end-of-life care. Filling knowledge gaps is crucial to set priorities and advise on transition model of care that best fits the oldest-old.
064fc5c0af69e9be13dee69a113ca743d05fd807	The simultaneous electrochemical determination of myricetin and rutin remains a challenge due to their indistinguishable potentials. To solve this problem, we constructed a ternary platinum nanoparticle, reduced graphene oxide, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs) nanocomposite via a facile one-pot synthetic method. Under the optimized conditions, the ternary Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite exhibited good electrocatalytic activity toward myricetin and rutin via solid phase extraction and excellent performance for the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin. The oxidation peak current of myricetin was proportional to its concentrations in the range of 0.05e50 mM with a detection limit of 0.01 mM (S/N ¼ 3). The linear range for rutin was 0.05e50 mM with a detection limit of 0.005 mM (S/N ¼ 3). The ternary nanocomposite sensor also exhibited good reproducibility and stability, and was successfully used for the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin in real orange juice samples with recoveries ranging between 100.57% and 108.46%.
d6064871da1ab19b1e90c9f50cdc8bdf7e79be28	The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of COVID-19 factors and psychological factors with psychological distress among dental staff during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 338 Israeli dentists and dental hygienists, who provided their demographic data; answered questions about COVID-19-related factors; and were assessed by subjective overload, self-efficacy, and psychological distress scales. Data were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression. Results revealed that elevated psychological distress was found among those who have background illness, fear of contracting COVID-19 from patient, and a higher subjective overload. Lower psychological distress was associated with being in a committed relationship and having higher scores for self-efficacy. Given these results, gathered during times of an infectious disease outbreak, exploring psychological distress among dental staff is warranted as the effects may be long-term.
6a1559ff83de042f8ae732ed4966e26ed98c37e8	Background: As bats have recently been described to harbor many different viruses, several studies have investigated the genetic co-variation between viruses and different bat species. However, little is known about the genetic co-variation of viruses and different populations of the same bat species, although such information is needed for an understanding of virus transmission dynamics within a given host species. We hypothesized that if virus transmission between host populations depends on events linked to gene flow in the bats, genetic co-variation should exist between host populations and astroviruses. Results: We used 19 nuclear and one mitochondrial microsatellite loci to analyze the genetic population structure of the Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) within and among populations at different geographical scales in Germany. Further, we correlated the observed bat population structure to that of partial astrovirus sequences (323-394 nt fragments of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) obtained from the same bat populations. Our analyses revealed that the studied bat colonies can be grouped into three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to the three geographic regions sampled. Furthermore, we observed an overall isolation-by-distance pattern, while no significant pattern was observed within a geographic region. Moreover, we found no correlation between the genetic distances among the bat populations and the astrovirus sequences they harbored. Even though high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions was detected, identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions. Conclusions: The genetic population structure of the bat host suggests that mating sites where several local breeding colonies meet act as stepping-stones for gene flow. Identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions suggesting that astroviruses are mostly transmitted among host colonies at the local scale. Nevertheless, high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions implies that occasional transmission across regions with subsequent mutations of the virus haplotypes does occur.
dba2a2faaecf818e36becf94bf6e329577bac3f8	Aminopeptidase N (APN) or CD13 is a conserved type II integral membrane zinc-dependent metalloprotease in the M1 family of ectoenzymes. APN is abundant in the kidneys and central nervous system. Identified substrates include Angiotensin III (Ang III); neuropeptides, including enkephalins and endorphins; and homones, including kallidan and somatostatin. It is developmentally expressed, a myelomonocytic marker for leukemias, and a receptor for coronovirus. There is evolving support for APN in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension. In rodent strains, intracerebraventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of APN reduces, while inhibitors of APN activity have a pressor effect on blood pressure. Dysregulation of central APN has been linked to the pathogenesis of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. There is evidence that renal tubule APN inhibits Na flux and plays a mechanistic role in salt-adaptation. A functional polymorphism of the ANP gene has been identified in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat. Signaling by APN impacting on blood pressure is likely mediated by regulation of the metabolism of Ang III to Ang IV. Whether APN regulates arterial blood pressure in humans or is a therapeutic target for hypertension are subjects for future exploration. Keywords Aminopeptidase N Á Hypertension Aminopeptidase N (APN), which is also known as leucine aminopeptidase, alanyl aminopeptidase (AlaAP), aminopeptidase M, or CD13, is a conserved type II integral membrane zinc-dependent metalloprotease. This peptidase belongs to the M1 family of ectoenzymes [1-3]. Membrane-associated APN/CD13 is a non-covalently bonded homodimer with a mass of 160 kDa. Each subunit consists of 967 amino acids and contains a small (8-10 amino acid) N-terminal segment in the cytosol, a single transmembrane helical spanning domain, and an extracellular C-terminus (review [4]; Fig. 1 ). The APN protein is highly conserved in rabbit, rat, and human species with the differences occurring primarily in the stalk region immediately downstream from the transmembrane domain. APN contains a Zn 2+ -binding HELAH motif. The protein is highly glycosylated in vivo, and evidence suggests that unique asparagine-linked sugar chains contain a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue [5, 6] . Hemoporphyrins and Zn 2+ inhibit APN activity [7, 8] . A soluble form has been detected in both plasma and urine [9] [10] [11]. APN preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from the amino terminus of oligopeptides. In biological systems, primary peptide substrates identified include neuropeptides such as Met-and Leu-enkephalins [12] , neurokinin A, Metlys-bradykinin, and endorphins [13] [14] [15] ; hormones, including somatostatin [16], kallidin [17, 18] , and collagen type IV [19] . In addition, APN metabolizes the heptapeptide angiotensin 2-8 (Ang III) to the hexapeptide angiotensin 3-8 (Ang IV) via cleavage of the N-terminal arginine, suggesting that this protease can regulate both systemic and tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) signaling [16, 20, 21] .
09cba4ea15eda3c3bd33243487c9bd32928d9635	Hematophagous insects transmit infectious diseases. Sand flies are vectors of leishmaniasis, but can also transmit viruses. We have been studying immune responses of Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. We identified a non-specific antiviral response in L. longipalpis LL5 embryonic cells when treated with non-specific double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). This response is reminiscent of interferon response in mammals. We are investigating putative effectors for this antiviral response. Secreted molecules have been implicated in immune responses, including interferon-related responses. We conducted a mass spectrometry analysis of conditioned medium from LL5 cells 24 and 48 h after dsRNA or mock treatment. We identified 304 proteins. At 24 h, 19 proteins had an abundance equal or greater than 2-fold change, while the levels of 17 proteins were reduced when compared to control cells. At the 48 h time point, these numbers were 33 and 71, respectively. The two most abundant secreted peptides at 24 h in the dsRNA-transfected group were phospholipid scramblase, an interferon-inducible protein that mediates antiviral activity, and forskolin-binding protein (FKBP), a member of the immunophilin family, which mediates the effect of immunosuppressive drugs. The transcription profile of most candidates did not follow the pattern of secreted protein abundance.
99546d7d5d78de11530ac37edd17373664c80d99	Background It is unknown how the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the current acute respiratory illness COVID-19 pandemic that has infected millions of people, affects people with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The aim of this study is to describe how individuals with IDD have been affected in the first 100 days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Shortly after the first COVID-19 case was reported in the USA, our organisation, which provides continuous support for over 11 000 individuals with IDD, assembled an outbreak committee composed of senior leaders from across the health care organisation. The committee led the development and deployment of a comprehensive COVID-19 prevention and suppression strategy, utilising current evidence-based practice, while surveilling the global and local situation daily. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures across 2400 homes, which were communicated to our

4a5d6add3e5d8b9b3709974fdb6d73bb2b245a81	Clinical dashboards summarize indicators of high-volume patient data in a concise, user-friendly visual format. There are few studies of the use of dashboards to improve professional practice in anesthesiology. The objective of the present study was to describe the user-centered development, implementation and preliminary evaluation of clinical dashboards dealing with anesthesia unit management and quality assessment in a French university medical center. User needs and technical requirements were identified in end user interviews and then synthesized. Several representations were then developed (according to good visualization practice) and submitted to end users for appraisal. Lastly, dashboards were implemented and made accessible for everyday use via the medical center's network. After a period of use, end user feedback on the dashboard platform was collected as a system usability score (range 0 to 100). Seventeen themes (corresponding to 29 questions and 42 indicators) were identified. After prioritization and feasibility assessment, 10 dashboards were ultimately implemented and deployed. The dashboards variously addressed the unit's overall activity, compliance with guidelines on intraoperative hemodynamics, ventilation and monitoring, and documentation of the anesthesia procedure. The mean (standard deviation) system usability score was 82.6 (11.5), which corresponded to excellent usability. We developed clinical dashboards for a university medical center's anesthesia units. The dashboards' deployment was well received by the center's anesthesiologists. The dashboards' impact on activity and practice after several months of use will now have to be assessed.

Methods: Asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid testing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively enrolled. The characteristics of CT imaging and clinical feature were collected and analyzed.
356d5ae1d40ad3c4ba2199ec7bd3966c56858936	The outbreak of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia in Wuhan has attracted worldwide attention. To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. We proposed an SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model to analyze the epidemic trend in Wuhan and use the AI model to analyze the epidemic trend in non-Wuhan areas. We found that if the closure was lifted, the outbreak in non-Wuhan areas of mainland China would double in size. Our SEIR and AI model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23, 2020, was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.
9777939fc099d7e88d3aaab549e5b3ff333a0ff9	The synthesis of N-methyl-D-ribopyranuronamide nucleosides is described. The key route is the rearrangement of a 1,2-O-isopropylidene protected furanose sugar with a carboxamide function in the 4-position to a ribopyranuronamide ring. The Lewis acid catalyzed condensation of adenine and thymine nucleobases with the per-O-acetylated N-methyl-D-ribopyranuronamide sugar is used to give the target nucleosides as a mixture of the a and b anomers. The mixture was separated and the final compounds were obtained by deacetylation in basic conditions.
bf1126fea85a28be3624de5e7313ae1a34934398	adolescents and adults with TOF who had hypoplastic pulmonary annulus underwent concomitant TOF repair with PVR at our institute. We retrospectively collected the data from the hospital records including follow up. Mean age of the patients was 18.48Â±7.53 years. Bioprosthetic valve size ranged from 19mm to 25mm. There was no early or late mortality. No patient had developed low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), acute renal failure, ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, or sepsis. Follow-up was complete and at a mean duration of 41.3 ±10.4 months, no patient required reoperation or re-interventions. Mean QRS duration, RV function, RV end systolic and end diastolic dimensions, Prosthetic valve gradient, RV myocardial performance index and Functional status(including NYHA class and 6-minute walk test) were not significantly different as compared to pre-discharge value. During follow-up, 2 patients (5.4%) developed moderate PR, and 2 patients (5.4%) developed moderate PS. Concomitant PVR with TOF repair in adult provides excellent early and midterm outcome, with acceptable rate of pulmonary valve degeneration at midterm. It not only smoothens the early postoperative course but, also preserves the right ventricular function as well as functional status at mid-term.
5c690e85f424664377c0b8c8c4848830e059bf56	A 2-year-old neutered female Shiba dog exhibited laboured breathing for 1 month. Computed tomography of the thoracic cavity revealed multiple nodules (2e5 mm diameter) in the lungs. Grossly, the lungs were firm and normal in shape. The nodules were greyewhite in colour. Microscopically, the nodules were non-encapsulated and exhibited an irregular shape. They were composed of polygonal or spindle cells with indistinct cell borders arranged in sheets. The cells had large, round, hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with no atypia. Intrapulmonary arterial emboli and infiltration into the bronchioles were observed. Immunohistochemically, the cells were positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and a-smooth muscle actin. Ultrastructurally, the cells displayed cytoplasmic processes, desmosomes and intermediate filaments. These findings led to a diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis with sarcomatous transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis in a dog.
082892426f4879c2bc7b763650c5f80dec0e9ddd	Volwassenen in de leeftijdsgroep vanaf 30 jaar krijgen per jaar per persoon gemiddeld 1-2 acute luchtweginfecties (1). De aard van het beroep van huisarts kan betekenen dat dit aantal voor huisartsen hoger ligt maar daarover is weinig informatie bekend. Ter vergelijking: kinderen van 0-2 jaar krijgen gemiddeld tussen de 5 en 6 acute luchtweginfecties per jaar (1). Verkoudheden kunnen worden veroorzaakt door verschillende virussen, waarvan het rhinovirus de meest frequent voorkomende is (zie tabel). Van e´e´n virus bestaan in het algemeen meerdere serotypes. Alleen al het rhinovirus kent meer dan 100 verschillende serotypes. Het voorkomen van verkoudheden is seizoengebonden. In de gebieden op het noordelijke halfrond met een gematigd klimaat neemt het aantal luchtweginfecties in de loop van september snel toe. Gedurende de wintermaanden blijft het aantal redelijk hoog om in het voorjaar weer af te nemen. Sommige virussen, zoals het rhinovirus, komen nagenoeg het hele jaar voor. Anderen, zoals het influenzavirus en het RS-virus, circuleren vooral in het late najaar, de winter en het vroege voorjaar. Over het in 2001 door de afdeling Virologie van de Erasmus Universiteit ontdekte Humane Metapneumovirus is over het voorkomen door het jaar nog onvoldoende bekend. De overdracht van virussen die acute luchtweginfectie veroorzaken kan in principe op 3 manieren plaats hebben.
8454a603c141a7d6f903fec504513b01dea64f52	Influenza A and B viruses are a global threat to human health and increasing resistance to the existing antiviral drugs necessitates new concepts to expand the therapeutic options. Glycopeptide derivatives have emerged as a promising new class of antiviral agents. To avoid potential antibiotic resistance, these antiviral glycopeptides are preferably devoid of antibiotic activity. We prepared six vancomycin aglycone hexapeptide derivatives with the aim of obtaining compounds having anti-influenza virus but no antibacterial activity. Two of them exerted strong and selective inhibition of influenza A and B virus replication, while antibacterial activity was successfully eliminated by removing the critical N-terminal moiety. In addition, these two molecules offered protection against several other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, and human coronavirus, classifying these glycopeptides as broad antiviral molecules with a favorable therapeutic index. Pharmaceuticals 2020, 13, 139 2 of 15 Glycopeptide antibiotics like teicoplanin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin were shown to inhibit Ebola pseudovirus infection [15] and prevent the host cell entry process of Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [16]. Moreover, semisynthetic hydrophobic derivatives of vancomycin and teicoplanin antibiotics were reported to inhibit HIV [17,18], SARS-CoV [19], HCV [20], and flaviviruses [21]. The anti-influenza virus potential of lipophilic derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics was first discovered by our group. We reported a class of molecules with various lipophilic modifications at the N-terminal part of the peptide core of ristocetin, showing robust inhibition of influenza virus replication in cell culture [22] . Mechanistic studies with the lead compound demonstrated interference with virus uptake by endocytosis [23] . Encouraged by the favorable selectivity of this compound, we prepared a series of ristocetin and teicoplanin analogues in a systematic manner, to gain further insight in the structure-activity relationship [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Recently, we prepared a series of teicoplanin pseudoaglycone (TC) derivatives by coupling one or two lipophilic side chains to the N-terminus of the glycopeptide core, using triazole, sulfonamide or maleimide linking elements [30] . Some of the modifications yielded remarkably effective inhibitors of influenza A and B viruses with low cytotoxicity. Besides the potent antiviral effect, most analogues proved to be also active against Gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin resistant enterococci. Due to the global threat of antibiotic resistance, the antibacterial activity in this case represents a drawback that could hinder application of these types of derivatives as antiviral agents. The undesirable antibacterial activity of antiviral glycopeptides has been suggested by others as well. Several glycopeptide analogues have been synthesized and evaluated against retroviruses [17, 18] . As the antibacterial activity of these derivatives was a concern, the same researchers prepared and evaluated aminodecyl and adamantyl functionalized compounds with partially destroyed peptide cores [31] . These degradation products lacking antibacterial activity typically displayed more-or-less weaker antiviral properties than the intact analogues. Similarly, in the present work we decided to overcome the issue of intrinsic antibacterial activity by using a degraded glycopeptide aglycone, but also exploiting the results of our study on antiviral TC derivatives [30] at the same time. The first step in the synthetic plan was to select three TC derivatives with optimal antiviral activity combined with low cytotoxicity from our former antiviral study. As for the elimination of the antibacterial activity, obtaining a degradation product with no antibacterial activity from teicoplanin antibiotics is a very difficult task. Even after destroying one or more amide bonds of the peptide core (which are key in binding to the target bacterial cell-wall precursors) some activity still persists [32, 33] . The complete elimination of the antibacterial activity requires the concurrent removal of amino acids 1 and 3, which is rather laborious [34] . As such, the simple postliminary degradation of the selected TC derivatives was considered implausible. On the other hand, in the case of vancomycin or its aglycone, the N-terminal N-methyl-d-leucine moiety can be easily removed by 36] yielding hexapeptide derivatives that are inactive against bacteria, likely due to their inability to bind to the target cell-wall precursors terminating in d-Ala-d-Ala. Since we previously determined, that the antiviral activity of TC derivatives is primarily influenced by the structure of the side chains [30], we envisioned that we could reprogram vancomycin to create selective antiviral agents free of antibacterial activity by incorporating the appropriate lipophilic moieties of the former teicoplanins into vancomycin aglycone hexapeptide. Results and Discussion We synthesized a total of six derivatives by preparing two variants for the three selected side chains. These two variations consist of modifying the vancomycin aglycone hexapeptide in either the Nor C-terminal position. In this way, we wanted to learn whether the side chain attachment site influences the antiviral activity.
c938a1a3b4125d867ec200bdd37781c7c1a7d05c	Aquatic birds harbor diverse influenza A viruses and are a major viral reservoir in nature. The recent discovery of influenza viruses of a new H17N10 subtype in Central American fruit bats suggests that other New World species may similarly carry divergent influenza viruses. Using consensus degenerate RT-PCR, we identified a novel influenza A virus, designated as H18N11, in a flat-faced fruit bat (Artibeus planirostris) from Peru. Serologic studies with the recombinant H18 protein indicated that several Peruvian bat species were infected by this virus. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that, in some gene segments, New World bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined, indicative of a long-standing host-virus association. Structural and functional analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase indicate that sialic acid is not a ligand for virus attachment nor a substrate for release, suggesting a unique mode of influenza A virus attachment and activation of membrane fusion for entry into host cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that bats constitute a potentially important and likely ancient reservoir for a diverse pool of influenza viruses.
25bbf0068a86026bf0a67bb206de15926f09b468	The world is experiencing one of the greatest public health emergencies in history with the global spread of COVID-19. Health systems, including Primary Health Care (PHC) services, are pillars of pandemic coping strategies, and there are important gaps in the literature on the best ways to organize PHC in health crisis scenarios such as the one currently experienced. Given the urgency of responses, we performed a rapid systematic literature review on MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE and LILACS (via VHL), in order to analyze empirical studies on the effectiveness of PHC organization strategies in the context of epidemics to improve access and reduce morbidity and mortality. We selected seven articles, which studied the responses to different epidemics in different parts of the world. In terms of access, the studies suggest positive results with the adoption of adjustments of work processes of the teams and the structure of the services, combined with diversification of actions (including call center), adequate provision of inputs and personal protective equipment, adequate action plans and communication strategies, and effective integration with public health services and other levels of care. No study analyzed population morbidity and mortality. The included studies suggest also that community-oriented PHC is more effective in crisis scenarios, indicating the necessity of strengthening of the Family Health Strategy in the Brazilian context.
006be99e337c84b8758591a54f0362353b24dfde	253 protein, C-reactive protein (CRPt), varies markedly under differing physiologic conditions (47). CRP, a homopentamer composed of nonglycosylated 24-kD subunits associated by noncovalent forces (24, 29), is a plasma protein whose rate of synthesis by the hepatocyte increases by several hundredfold or more during the systemic acute phase response to tissue injury (39). In studies of the synthesis and secretion of CRP by rabbit primary hepatocyte cultures prepared from animals stimulated in vivo to undergo the acute phase response, the half-time for secretion of newly synthesized CRP was found to decrease markedly from as much as 18 h in control hepatocytes to as little as 75 min in cells from acute phase animals (47), while the kinetics of albumin secretion determined in the same cultures, were rapid (half-time of 30-45 min) and did not vary during the acute phase response. Results of studies in which a fusion gene consisting of the rabbit CRP gene linked to the mouse metallothionein promoter was transfected into HeLa cells (29) indicated that the default rate of rabbit CRP secretion was rapid and suggested that changes in its transit time were due to its specific retention within unstimulated rabbit hepatocytes, rather than to facilitated export in cells from stimulated animals. However, CRP does not contain carboxy-terminal sequences reported to result in ER retention (29). Further, assembly of CRP does not appear to be rate-limiting, since in control as well as stimulated cells >90% of antigenically detectable CRP labeled in a 10-min pulse is pentameric as judged by its size on gel filtration, its differential reactivity with structure-specific antibodies, and its ability to bind phosphocholine (29, 46, 47, and our unpublished observations). In the present report, pulse-chase subcellular fractionation experiments identify the ER as the compartment in which CRP is retained. Both biochemical and immunohistochemical methods demonstrate specific binding of CRP to the lumenal face of detergent-permeabilized rough microsomes, but not to Golgi subfractions. Kinetic and equilibrium binding studies identify a high affinity CRP binding site which is present in hepatic rough microsomes from normal rabbits, but is not detected in microsomes from animals undergoing the acute phase response. Finally, nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP demonstrate a 60-kD band, distinct from BiP, which is detected in extracts of control rough microsomes, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. Together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that CRP is specifically retained within the ER by a novel mechanism which is downregulated during the acute phase response.
4c455b2fd9882bf990cd711e85a03db032f64d83	The last century has witnessed several assaults from RNA viruses, resulting in millions of death throughout the world. The 21st century appears no longer an exception, with the trend continued with escalated fear of SARS coronavirus in 2002 and further concern of influenza H5N1 in 2003. A novel influenza virus created the first pandemic of the 21st century, the pandemic flu in 2009 preceded with the emergence of another deadly virus, MERS-CoV in 2012. A novel coronavirus "SARS-CoV-2" (and the disease COVID-19) emerged suddenly, causing a rapid outbreak with a moderate case fatality rate. This virus is continuing to cause health care providers grave concern due to the lack of any existing immunity in the human population, indicating their novelty and lack of previous exposure. The big question is whether this novel virus will be establishing itself in an endemic form or will it eventually die out? Endemic viruses during circulation may acquire mutations to infect naïve, as well as individual with pre-existing immunity. Continuous monitoring is strongly advisable, not only to the newly infected individuals, but also to those recovered individuals who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as re-infection may lead to the selection of escape mutants and subsequent dissemination to the population. ARTICLE HISTORY
3085b3a500943dd56e4eafb7fde7215857e216b7	Objectives. We discuss two main potential sources of bias that might affect the results of the Italian nationwide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey conducted by the Italian Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Statistics in a sample of 150,000 persons in 2,000 cities for epidemiological purposes, at the end of May-beginning of June 2020. Methods. The first issue regards performance of serological tests. Comparing serological test results with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction available in an area of the Italian Region Friuli Venezia Giulia, we suspect that test performance is less than optimal, but still acceptable for estimating prevalence of antibodies. The second issue regards participation bias, which might produce distorted estimates and reduce usefulness of the survey. We show that participation bias is possible in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region and identify a number of potential causes. We acknowledge the importance of good communication and careful planning for effective interventions.
416cc55a6db719832c6271eec9e1d0e6fc81776a	A rapid increase in the number of patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may overwhelm the available medical resources. We aimed to evaluate risk factors for disease severity in the early stages of COVID-19. The cohort comprised 293 patients with COVID-19 from 5 March 2020, to 18 March 2020. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) classification system was used to triage patients. The clinical course was summarized, including the impact of drugs (angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARB], ibuprofen, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [DPP4i]) and the therapeutic effect of lopinavir/ritonavir. After adjusting for confounding variables, prior history of drug use, including ARB, ibuprofen, and DPP4i was not a risk factor associated with disease progression. Patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir had significantly shorter progression-free survival than those not receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. KCDC classification I clearly distinguished the improvement/stabilization group from the progression group of COVID-19 patients (AUC 0.817; 95% CI, 0.740-0.895).
2507611fbf4424fea18bcd136f5b02bd656039bd	Stunted growth of poults afflicted by enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) may be associated with depressed digestive capabilities. We conducted two experiments to test this hypothesis. Survivors of PEMS were obtained from a research flock that had been purposefully infected at 5 d of age with PEMS inoculum that included turkey corona virus. The PEMS survivors were assigned to Experiments 1 and 2, beginning at 40 and 35 d of age, respectively. Three groups (large, L; medium, M; and small, S) and two groups (L and S) of 20 poults each were selected to represent different degrees of stunting in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. When the body weights of each group in both experiments were plotted using initial body weight as the starting point, all of the (
cbc05d14c57b91081970a232ab83bc993f998fe2	The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.
31c984803a0d9f243445e5ff6657edfc9ee5cde6	Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a de novo coronavirus-MERS-CoV-that is associated with high mortality. However, the mechanism by which MERS-CoV infects humans remains unclear. To date, there is no effective vaccine or antibody for human immunity and treatment, other than the safety and tolerability of the fully human polyclonal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (SAB-301) as a putative therapeutic agent specific for MERS. Although rapid diagnostic and public health measures are currently being implemented, new cases of MERS-CoV infection are still being reported. Therefore, various effective measures should be taken to prevent the serious impact of similar epidemics in the future. Further investigation of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the virus, as well as the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic anti-MERS-CoV infections, is necessary. For this purpose, detailed information on MERS-CoV proteins is needed. In this review, we describe the major structural and nonstructural proteins of MERS-CoV and summarize different potential strategies for limiting the outbreak of MERS-CoV. The combination of computational biology and virology can accelerate the advanced design and development of effective peptide therapeutics against MERS-CoV. In summary, this review provides important information about the progress of the elimination of MERS, from prevention to treatment.

There are limited clinical or imaging data on muscle changes over time. Methods: Two adult SMA patients underwent clinical assessments including measures of upper and lower limb function with Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) and Hammersmith Function Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE); both patients were also studied with whole-body muscle MRI (T1-weighted and Diffusion Tensor Imaging/DTI sequences), at baseline and after 10 and 24 months from the beginning of treatment with nusinersen. Results: After two years of treatment, HFMSE and RULM scores were stable in both patients. DTI sequences revealed an increased number, length and organization of muscle fiber tracks, and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values showed a significant reduction after 10 and 24 months from baseline, in their corresponding maps. Discussion: Muscle DTI imaging seems to play an interesting role to monitor treatment effects over time in adult SMA patients.
a4f33fd554ee5e932370bdc1dfc2f4e51b3f590c	Mobile payment services have become increasingly important in daily lives in India due to multiple planned and unplanned events. The objective of this study is to identify the determinants of usage satisfaction of mobile payments which could enhance service adoption. The "Digital Service Usage Satisfaction Model" has been proposed and validated by combining technology adoption and service science literature. First the data was extracted from Twitter based on hashtags and keywords. Then using sentiment mining and topic modelling the large volumes of text were analysed. Then network science was also used for identifying clusters among associated topics. Then, using content analysis methodology, a theoretical model was developed based on literature. Finally using multiple regression analysis, we validated the proposed model. The study establishes that cost, usefulness, trust, social influence, credibility, information privacy and responsiveness factors are more important to increase the usage satisfaction of mobile payments services. Also methodologically, this is an endeavour to validate a new approach which uses social media data for developing a inferential theoretical model.
edb3e4ec423d88ba09d036e6ede8bb988bb16045	We estimated time-varying reproduction numbers of COVID-19 transmission in counties and regions of California and in states of the United States, using the Wallinga-Teunis method of estimations applied to publicly available data. The serial interval distribution assumed incorporates wide uncertainty in delays from symptom onset to case reporting. This assumption contributes smoothing and a small but meaningful increase in numerical estimates of reproduction numbers due to the likely existence of secondary cases not yet reported. Transmission in many areas of the U.S. may not yet be controlled, including some areas in which case counts appear to be stable or slowly declining.
4fd85c18468608227ea3022a6445e5a1042b2b33	The bin packing problem is a widespread combinatorial problem. It aims at packing a set of items by using as few bins as possible. Among the many available solving methods, approximation ones such as heuristics have become popular due to their reduced cost and generally acceptable solutions. A further step in this regard is given by hyperheuristics, which literature usually defines as "high-level heuristics to choose heuristics". Hyper-heuristics choose one suitable heuristic from a set of available ones, to solve a particular portion of an instance. As the search progresses, heuristics can be exchanged, adapting the solution process to the current problem state under exploration. In this work, we describe how to generate and use hyper-heuristics that keep a record of the scores achieved by individual heuristics on previously solved bin packing problem instances in the form of rules. Then, hyper-heuristics manage those scores to estimate the performance of such heuristics on unseen instances. In this way, the previous actions of the hyper-heuristics determine which heuristic to use on future unseen cases. The experiments conducted under different scenarios yield promising results where some of the hyper-heuristics produced outperform isolated heuristics.
312e1041e48d40dc988bab2cdf8bbe4724690671	Since December 2019, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread from Wuhan, China to the world, it has caused more than 87,000 diagnosed cases and more than 3,000 deaths globally. To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. CoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated. This state revealed by cryo-EM first time could provide an important information for the identification and relevant clinical research of this new coronavirus.

G6PD deficiency may especially predispose to hemolysis upon coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection when employing pro-oxidant therapy. However, glutathione depletion is reversible by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration. We describe a severe case of COVID-19 infection in a G6PD-deficient patient treated with hydroxychloroquine who benefited from intravenous (IV) NAC beyond reversal of hemolysis. NAC blocked hemolysis and elevation of liver enzymes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin and allowed removal from respirator and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and full recovery of the G6PD-deficient patient. NAC was also administered to 9 additional respirator-dependent COVID-19-infected patients without G6PD deficiency. NAC elicited clinical improvement and markedly reduced CRP in all patients and ferritin in 9/10 patients. NAC mechanism of action may involve the blockade of viral infection and the ensuing cytokine storm that warrant followup confirmatory studies in the setting controlled clinical trials.

ca959daa7887a0ac3a89b7996e6f40b468ad45e6	Motion estimation is an important component of video codecs and various applications in computer vision. Especially in video compression the compact representation of motion fields is crucial, as modern video codecs use them for inter frame prediction. In recent years compression methods relying on diffusion-based inpainting have been becoming an increasingly competitive alternative to classical transform-based codecs. They perform particularly well on piecewise smooth data, suggesting that motion fields can be efficiently represented by such approaches. However, they have so far not been used for the compression of motion data. Therefore, we assess the potential of flow field compression based on homogeneous diffusion with a specifically designed new framework: Our codec stores only a few representative flow vectors and reconstructs the flow field with edge-aware homogeneous diffusion inpainting. Additionally stored edge data thereby ensure the accurate representation of discontinuities in the flow field. Our experiments show that this approach can outperform state-of-the-art codecs such as JPEG2000 and BPG/HEVC intra.
50627f92db9c17c742fb2cc95641bad921bec3ee	The sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 prompted the establishment of a global scientific network subsuming most of the traditional rivalries in the competitive field of virology. Within months of the SARS outbreak, collaborative work revealed the identity of the disastrous pathogen as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, although the rapid identification of the agent represented an important breakthrough, our understanding of the deadly virus remains limited. Detailed biological knowledge is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures, diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV. This article reviews the present state of molecular knowledge about SARS-CoV, from the aspects of comparative genomics, molecular biology of viral genes, evolution, and epidemiology, and describes the diagnostic tests and the anti-viral drugs derived so far based on the available molecular information.
61a94a9a3c38ebffc0bc3b5d2dde84f299a27569	The etiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis for a newly emerging disease are generally unknown to clinicians. Effective interventions and treatments at the earliest possible times are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum, and inappropriate treatments should be abolished. In this situation, the ability to extract most information out of the data available is critical so that important decisions can be made. Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time while effective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constant fatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to a Brownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of the Brownian motion, we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a sequential tests approach. This allows the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate to be rejected at the earliest possible time when adequate statistical evidence accumulates. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed test is good and it is extremely sensitive in picking up decreasing fatality rate. The proposed test is applied to the severe acute respiratory syndrome data in Hong Kong and Beijing.
643cc46616580faba24162bfca4bba175fb70384	The resurgence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the form of unprecedented and explosive epidemics in India and the Indian Ocean islands after a gap of 32 years is a major public health concern. Currently, there is no specific therapy available to treat CHIKV infection. In the present study, the in vitro prophylactic and therapeutic effects of chloroquine on CHIKV replication in Vero cells were investigated. Inhibitory effects were observed when chloroquine was administered pre-infection, post-infection, and concurrent with infection, suggesting that chloroquine has prophylactic and therapeutic potential. The inhibitory effects were confirmed by performing a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis of viral RNA levels, and cell viability assays. Chloroquine diminished CHIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner, with an effective concentration range of 5-20 mM. Concurrent addition of drug with virus, or treatment of cells prior to infection drastically reduced virus infectivity and viral genome copy number by !99.99%. The maximum inhibitory effect of chloroquine was observed within 1-3 hr post-infection (hpi), and treatment was ineffective once the virus successfully passed through the early stages of infection. The mechanism of inhibition of virus activity by chloroquine involved impaired endosomalmediated virus entry during early stages of virus replication, most likely through the prevention of endocytosis and/or endosomal acidification, based on a comparative evaluation using ammonium chloride, a known lysosomotropic agent.
48050ea5d66695946ddfbb0470c67582a06ca83e	Essay Over the past half century, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a low-income and post-conflict country, has experienced several Ebola Virus Disease outbreaks, with different fatality rates. The DRC is currently experiencing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using the PEN-3 cultural model, we assessed the socio-cultural factors affecting public trust in the government and its health agencies. Results of this analysis revealed the perceptions, enablers, and nurturers that impacted public trust in the government and its health agencies among the Congolese population. Future interventions designed to address the COVID-19 in the DRC should account for these socio-cultural factors. The Pan African Medical Journal. 2020;35 (Supp 2):2 | Guy-Lucien Whembolua et al.
2de8a8e4d7692a61cd0389c5488b8c301ccbf7a5	Part of the dorsal funiculus of the adult male rat (Wistar) spinal cord was treated for I h at the thoracolumbar level by running hot water, at approximately 48-50 ~ C, through a polyethylene tube 2 mm in diameter in contact with the dura. Animals were fixed 1 day to 4 weeks later and the spinal cords were examined by light and electron microscopy. The affected area in the dorsal funiculus was approximately i mm long and less than 1 mm wide at the dorsal surface, and varied from 0.4 to 0.7 mm in depth. Within 3 days after treatment, almost all the myelin sheaths in the affected area were degraded, leaving the axons denuded, and at the same time astrocyte endfeet at the glial limiting membrane were swollen and partly destroyed. Almost all the denuded axons remained intact, exhibiting no noticeable morphological changes. There was evidence of a moderate vasogenic oedema, but minimal signs of haemorrhage in the lesion. Seven days after treatment, many immature Schwann cells but no oligodendrocytes were found between the denuded axons. By 2 weeks many of the denuded axons were remyelinated, and by 4 weeks almost all of those axons located near the pial and per;vascular surfaces had been remyelinated by Schwann cells, while most of those located in the deep and marginal zones bordering the adjoining intact areas were remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Longitudinal sections revealed that at nodes of Ranvier PNS-type myelin sheaths were apposed by either intact or newly formed CNS-type myelin sheaths. A typical glial limiting rnembrane was not reformed beneath the pial surface, but an inconspicuous one was found between the PNS-and CNS-type fibre areas.
d35ffff3c44bae9d1f970825290e885d396e26ad	This chapter first systematically summarizes the most important findings and policy implications of each of the chapters "Factors affecting traffic flow efficiency implications of connected and autonomous vehicles: A review and policy recommendations" by Narayanan et al.; "Automated bus systems in Europe: A systematic review of passenger experience and road user interaction" by Heikoop et al.; "Cyber security and its impact on CAV safety: Overview, policy needs and challenges" by Katrakazas et al.; "Cybersecurity certification and auditing of automotive industry" by Mateo Sanguino et al.; "The wider use of autonomous vehicles in non-commuting journeys" by Kimber et al.; "Policy implications of the potential carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission and energy impacts of highly automated vehicles" by Annema; "Potential health and wellbeing implications of autonomous vehicles" by Singleton et al.; "Data protection in a GDPR era: An international comparison of implications for autonomous vehicles" by Costantini et al.; "Ethical issues concerning automated vehicles and their implications for transport" by Dogan et al.; "Governance cultures and sociotechnical imaginaries of self-driving vehicle technology: Comparative analysis of Finland, UK and Germany" by Mladenovi c et al.; "Wider implications of autonomous vessels for the maritime industry: Mapping the unprecedented challenges" by Ghaderi; "The potential for automation to transform urban deliveries: Drivers, barriers and policy priorities" by Paddeu and Parkhurst. Next it synthesizes the overall findings and policy implications, and discusses future avenues for policy making and research. A first conclusion is that the chapters make clear that the ranges in policy relevant implications of AVs, within the scope of each chapter/topic, are still relatively broad. Secondly we conclude that research that is conceptually rich is more valuable for policy making. Thirdly we hypothesize that context matters for the uptake, impacts, and specific system design characteristics of real world AV implementation. Fourth we conclude that research on the global south has been limited so far. Fifth we argue that AVs, shared vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) might stimulate each other in a positive way, in all directions. Finally we conclude that AVs will have wider societal implications, such as in the area of land use, accessibility, Advances in Transport Policy and Planning # 2020 Elsevier Inc. social exclusion, governmental expenditures, the labor market, and the environment. The more indirect the effects of AVs are, the more difficult they are to understand. For policy making a first conclusion is that the issues of ethics, cyber security and data protection deserve way more attention than they currently get. We also conclude that future motorway network extensions might not be no-regret anymore, because of possible congestion reductions due to AVs, but also because of decreasing marginal values of time. Finally we argue that countries that introduce AVs later than other countries can learn a lot from the real world experiences elsewhere.
b6c62ca4653ef469da8a131bcd9fe168e439e3a3	The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and codes for a vast number of glycoproteins that differ greatly both in amino acid composition and function. The CEA family is divided into two groups, the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins. The CEA family members are implicated in pleiotropic (patho)physiological functions including cell-cell adhesion, pregnancy, immunity, neovascularization, regulation of insulin homeostasis, and carcinogenesis. In general, the CEA-encoded proteins are composed of an extracellular region with Ig variable and constant-like domains and a cytoplasmic region containing signaling motifs. Of particular interest, the well-studied human and mouse CEA genes are arranged in clusters in a single chromosome. Taking into account this characteristic, we made an effort to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the CEA gene family. Toward this end, the publicly available genomes were searched extensively for CEA homologs. The domain organization of the retrieved protein sequences was analyzed, and, subsequently, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the entire length CEA homologous proteins were performed. A series of evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues, functionally important, were identified. The relative positioning of these residues on the modeled tertiary structure of novel CEA protein domains revealed that they are, also, spatially conserved. Furthermore, the chromosomal arrangement of CEA genes was examined, and it was found that the CEA genes are preserved in terms of position, transcriptional orientation, and number in all species under investigation.

f64fbf23ee2ebcdfbc4c798721e3350646a7e45a	The new coronavirus disease threatens the lives of millions of people around the world, making it the largest health threat in recent times. Billions of people around the world are asked to adhere to strict shelter-in-place rules, finalised to slow down the spread of the virus. Appeals and messages are being used by leaders and policy-makers to promote pandemic response. Given the stakes at play, it is thus important for social scientists to explore which messages are most effective in promoting pandemic response. In fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of several messages on people's intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages on people's actual engagement, and not on intentions. Specifically, our dependent variables are the level of understanding of official COVID-19 pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through comprehension questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we test a novel set of appeals built through the theory of norms. One message targets the personal norm (what people think is the right thing to do), one targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one targets the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove of). Our experiment is conducted online with a representative (with respect to gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms are made salient using a flier. We find that normbased fliers had no effect on comprehension and on time spent on the panels. These results suggest that norm-based interventions through fliers have very little impact on people's reading and understanding of COVID-19 pandemic response governmental rules.
6f1306683fad3edf1986eea14493fddc3efefe04	We tested the idea that the brain's ability to use previous experience to influence processing of sounds is weaker in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in neurotypical individuals. We found no difference between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls in brain wave responses to sounds that occurred earlier than expected in either simple or complex rhythms. There was also no relationship between these brain waves and social communication or repetitive behavior scores. The brain's ability to encode temporal patterns and predict upcoming events is critical for speech perception and other aspects of social communication. Deficits in predictive coding may contribute to difficulties with social communication and overreliance on repetitive predictable environments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a mismatch negativity (MMN) task involving rhythmic tone sequences of varying complexity, we tested the hypotheses that 1) individuals with ASD have reduced MMN response to auditory stimuli that deviate in presentation timing from expected patterns, particularly as pattern complexity increases and 2) amplitude of MMN signal is inversely correlated with level of impairment in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Electroencephalography was acquired as individuals (age 6-21years) listened to repeated five-rhythm tones that varied in the Shannon entropy of the rhythm across three conditions (zero, medium-1 bit) and high-2 bit entropy). The majority of the tones conformed to the established rhythm (standard tones); occasionally the 4 th tone was temporally shifted relative to its expected time of occurrence (deviant tones). Social communication and repetitive behaviors were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Both neurotypical controls (n=19) and individuals with ASD (n=21) show stepwise decreases in MMN as a function of increasing entropy. Contrary to the result forecasted by a predictive coding hypothesis, individuals with ASD do not differ from controls in these neural mechanisms of prediction error to auditory rhythms of varied temporal complexity, and there is no relationship between these signals and social communication or repetitive behavior measures.
2e88a8b4428255754c9a5939a25049a145ed5740	The coronavirus disease 2019 has become a life-threatening pandemic. The epidemic trends in different countries vary considerably due to different policy-making and resources mobilization. We calculated basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproductive number (R t ) of COVID-19 by using the maximum likelihood method and the sequential Bayesian method, respectively. European and North American countries possessed higher R 0 and unsteady R t fluctuations, whereas some heavily affected Asian countries showed relatively low R 0 and declining R t now. The numbers of patients in Africa and Latin America are still low, but the potential risk of huge outbreaks cannot be ignored. Three scenarios were then simulated, generating distinct outcomes by using SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) model. First, evidence-based prompt responses yield lower transmission rate followed by decreasing R t . Second, implementation of effective control policies at a relatively late stage, in spite of huge casualties at early phase, can still achieve containment and mitigation. Third, wisely taking advantage of the time-window for developing countries in Africa and Latin America to adopt adequate measures can save more people's life. Our mathematical modeling provides evidence for international communities to develop sound design of containment and mitigation policies for COVID-19.
