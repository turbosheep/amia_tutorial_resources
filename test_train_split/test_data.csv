cc3d2830fa273ecc92c303d274c48be914da9343	The most recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, which was unprecedented in the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of nations affected, highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) or sequelae 1 . No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue, with antiviral activity against EBOV. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV and other filoviruses in cellbased assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays using a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (halflife, 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eyes, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once-daily intravenous administration of 10 mg kg −1 GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two out of six treated animals. These results show the first substantive post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses, including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses, suggests the potential for wider medical use. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing. The 2013-2016 outbreak of EVD in West Africa was the largest and most complex EBOV outbreak in the recorded history of the disease, with >28,000 EVD cases and >11,000 reported deaths 1 . Medical infrastructures in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia were seriously impacted by a loss of >500 healthcare workers 1 . Additionally, EVDrelated sequelae (joint and muscle pain, as well as neurological, ophthalmic, and other symptoms) together with viral persistence and

For the former, objective-time chart, RAT 2 IO modules and workflow diagrams are used for project management. For the latter, the integration of experiments, modeling and synthesis expedites product conceptualization and prototyping. Tasks for which chemical engineers are expected to play a key or a supporting role are discussed. An industrial application -the development of a skin-care cream is described alongside the procedure in order to illustrate the myriad issues in product development. In addition to the traditional engineering problems such as process and equipment design, product characterization, performance evaluation, and stability tests are also included as an integral part of this approach.
c61bc72220e0d9fbfa5ac73132178ef7b7b580bb	Background: Since its first detection in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has spread rapidly around the world. Although there have been several studies investigating prognostic factors for severe COVID-19, there have been no such studies in Korea. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Daegu, Korea. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Severe disease was defined as a composite outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit care, or death. Results: Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 19.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90-193.42; P = 0.012), body temperature ≥ 37.8°C (OR, 10.91; 95% CI, 1.35-88.36; P = 0.025), peripheral oxygen saturation < 92% (OR, 33.31; 95% CI, 2.45-452.22 ; P = 0.008), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) > 6.3 (OR, 56.84; 95% CI, 2.64-1,223.78, P = 0.010) at admission were associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19. The likelihood of development of severe COVID-19 increased with an increasing number of prognostic factors. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that diabetes mellitus, body temperature ≥ 37.8°C, peripheral oxygen saturation < 92%, and CK-MB > 6.3 are independent predictors of severe disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Appropriate assessment of prognostic factors and close monitoring to provide the necessary interventions at the appropriate time in high-risk patients may reduce the case fatality rate of COVID-19.
3965a2d31b31a317f72d0f08695060dbd6952f82	The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the COVID-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409e7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128e1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588e13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th e 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.
57bcd251e2d4f611eddf330ca913ba880dd94576	We examine here the outcome of viral encephalomyelitis [mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59, Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus, and Coxsackievirus B3] in mice with autoantibodies to a central nervous system (CNS)-specific antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, that usually develop no clinical disease. Morbidity and mortality of the acute viral CNS disease was augmented by the presence of the autoantibodies in all three viral infections. Transfer of serum containing the autoantibodies at the time of infection with MHV was sufficient to reproduce the exacerbated disease. The presence of the autoantibodies was found to result in increased infiltration of mononuclear cells into the brain. Early demyelination was severely augmented in brains and spinal cords of MHV-infected mice with CNS-specific autoantibodies. The antibodymediated exacerbation was shown to be independent of the complement system but to require expression of Fc receptors, because it was observed in C-3-deficient but not in Fc receptor-deficient mice. Our study illustrates the possibility that infections can lead to much more profound immunopathology in the presence of an otherwise latent autoimmune condition. (Am J Pathol 2007,

Despite this unique capability, TPL has experienced limited industrial adoption due to its low throughput. The recently developed parallel projection technique, called femtosecond projection TPL (FP-TPL), is a promising approach to scale up this process as it increases the throughput up to three orders of magnitude. However, it requires tuning of process parameters, including photopolymer material properties, to minimize over-polymerization-based defects. Here, we show how a modification of the optical projection strategy can be used to control these over-polymerization defects without tuning the photopolymer composition. Through optical modeling of the projection technique, we show that these defects can be minimized by altering the density of the projected mask. In addition, the aspect ratio of the submicron features can by reduced from more than 2 to 1.2. Thus, this optimal projection strategy transforms FP-TPL into a more robust process suitable for high-throughput high-quality 3D printing of micro and nanoscale structures.

a14f032727ab00fbeb4f957f7e88e02b9979f49c	The literature of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is fast expanding. This review focuses on several aspects of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) including epidemiology, diagnosis and management. COPD poses a major health and economic burden in the Asia-Pacific region, as it does worldwide. Triggering factors of AECOPD include infectious (bacteria and viruses) and environmental (air pollution and meteorological effect) factors. Disruption in the dynamic balance between the 'pathogens' (viral and bacterial) and the normal bacterial communities that constitute the lung microbiome likely contributes to the risk of exacerbations. The diagnostic approach to AECOPD varies based on the clinical setting and severity of the exacerbation. After history and examination, a number of investigations may be useful, including oximetry, sputum culture, chest X-ray and blood tests for inflammatory markers. Arterial blood gases should be considered in severe exacerbations, to characterize respiratory failure. Depending on the severity, the acute management of AECOPD involves use of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, oxygen and noninvasive ventilation. Hospitalization may be required, for severe exacerbations. Nonpharmacological interventions including disease-specific self-management, pulmonary rehabilitation, early medical follow-up, home visits by respiratory health workers, integrated programmes and telehealth-assisted hospital at home have been studied during hospitalization and shortly after discharge in patients who have had a recent AECOPD. Pharmacological approaches to reducing risk of future exacerbations include long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, mucolytics, vaccinations and long-term macrolides. Further studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in preventing COPD exacerbations.
bfdeb46c2155004f156dbcfc0aa7d571780fc1e0	A series of novel mono-and binuclear arene− ruthenium(II) complexes [(p-cym)Ru(L)Cl] containing 11Hindeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one derivatives or tryptanthrin-6oxime were synthesized and characterized by X-ray crystallography, IR, NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and elemental analysis. Theoretical calculations invoking singlet state geometry optimization, solvation effects, and noncovalent interactions were done using density functional theory (DFT). DFT calculations were also applied to evaluate the electronic properties, and time-dependent DFT was applied to clarify experimental UV−vis results. Cytotoxicity for cancerous and noncancerous human cell lines was evaluated with cell viability MTT assay. Complexes demonstrated a moderate cytotoxic effect toward cancerous human cell line PANC-1. The catalytic activity of the complexes was evaluated in transfer hydrogenation of aryl ketones. All complexes exhibited good catalytic activity and functional group tolerance.
607849314688f6bdf23c8e6b692145d0ee25ba35	Improving evidence for action is crucial to tackle antimicrobial resistance. The number of interventions for antimicrobial resistance is increasing but current research has major limitations in terms of efforts, methods, scope, quality, and reporting. Moving the agenda forwards requires an improved understanding of the diversity of interventions, their feasibility and cost-benefit, the implementation factors that shape and underpin their effectiveness, and the ways in which individual interventions might interact synergistically or antagonistically to influence actions against antimicrobial resistance in different contexts. Within the efforts to strengthen the global governance of antimicrobial resistance, we advocate for the creation of an international One Health platform for online learning. The platform will synthesise the evidence for actions on antimicrobial resistance into a fully accessible database; generate new scientific insights into the design, implementation, evaluation, and reporting of the broad range of interventions relevant to addressing antimicrobial resistance; and ultimately contribute to the goal of building societal resilience to this central challenge of the 21st century.

786fe613393be3df368bfc7caa00a2f8d8f63996	A prevalent PEDV strain, designated FJLY06, was isolated from Fujian, China. The four of structural genes sequences of PEDV obtained were analyzed to determine their phylogenetic relationships and homology respectively, revealing that FJLY06 was highly homologous to virulent PEDV strains. The four structural genes all differed genetically from the vaccine strain CV777. The sequence alignment results further showed that N, M and E genes of Chinese PEDV strains is highly conserved. Compared with the vaccine strain CV777, 8 mutations were detected in COE of FJLY06 S gene. The recombination analysis revealed FJLY06 is similar to other pandemic strains in China with a variant S gene, and maybe a reason for recent vaccination failures.

We aimed to develop a flexible model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation on survival outcomes and healthcare costs based on a shift in the disease stage at treatment initiation. The stage-shift model estimates population-level health economic outcomes by weighting disease stage-specific outcomes by the distribution of stages at treatment initiation, assuming delays lead to stageprogression. It allows for extrapolation of population-level survival data using parametric distributions to calculate the expected survival in life years. The model was demonstrated based on an analysis of the impact of 3 and 6month delays for stage I breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer patients, and for T1 melanoma, based on Australian data. In the absence of patient-level data about time to stage progression, two approaches were explored to estimate the proportion of patients that would experience a stage shift following the delay: 1) based on the relation between time to treatment initiation and overall survival (breast, colorectal and lung cancer), and 2) based on the tumour growth rate (melanoma). The model is available on http://stage-shift.personex.nl/. A shift from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay is least likely for colorectal cancer patients, with an estimated proportion of 3% of the stage I patients diagnosed in 2020 progressing to stage II, resulting in 11 excess deaths after 5 years and a total of 96 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. For breast and lung cancer, progression from stage I to stage II due to a 6-month delay were slightly higher at 5% (breast cancer) and 8% (lung cancer), resulting in 25 and 43 excess deaths after 5 years, and 239 and 373 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon, respectively. For melanoma, with 32% of T1 patients progressing to T2 disease following a 6-month delay, the model estimated 270 excess death after 5 years and 2584 life years lost over a 10-year time horizon. Conclusions: Using a conservative 3-month delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study predicts nearly 90 excess deaths and $12 million excess healthcare costs in Australia over 5 years for the in 2020 diagnosed patients for 4 cancers. If the delays increase to 6 months, excess mortality and cost approach nearly 350 deaths and $46 million in Australia. More accurate data on stage of disease during and after the COVID-19 pandemic are critical to obtain more reliable estimates.

One Health provides the framework to approach food safety risks from the whole ecosystem of the food system by using a Web of Causation approach instead of an 'us vs. them' approach. This whole ecosystem, One Health approach focuses on prevention through the integration of wildlife, environmental, human, and domestic health sectors improving our ability to prevent rather than react to disease events. A true One Health viewpoint understands that all life is connected to its habitat, and the health of the whole sits squarely on a robust and sustainable environment. Safe food and water, thus ecological health, can be ensured using an evidence-based, transdisciplinary, collaborative based approach to the solution of food production and public health.

Development of an effective vaccine against Pneumoviruses has proven to be particularly difficult; despite over 50 years of research in this field, no vaccine against HMPV or RSV is currently available. Recombinant chimeric viruses expressing antigens of other viruses can be generated by reverse genetics and used for simultaneous immunization against more than one pathogen. This approach can result in the development of promising vaccine candidates against HMPV, and several studies have indeed validated viral vectors expressing HMPV antigens. In this review, we summarize current efforts in generating recombinant chimeric vaccines against HMPV, and we discuss their potential optimization based on the correspondence with RSV studies.
8625500798fdc7f5c3e4793bd215f1ba2660cfda	The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in school closures and distancing requirements that have disrupted both work and family life for many. Concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally. Many medical journals have published papers on the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixedeffects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women's representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women, especially early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of men.
6b0567729c2143a66d737eb0a2f63f2dce2e5a7d	Inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract are commonly associated with elevated production of nitric oxide (NO • ) and increased indices of NO • -dependent oxidative stress. Although NO • is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO • to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO •dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO • generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. Instead, it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of NO • to inflammatory diseases of the lung. ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; EPO = eosinophil peroxidase; MPO = myeloperoxidase; NO • = nitric oxide; NOS = NO • synthase; O 2 •-= superoxide; ONOO -= peroxynitrite; RNS = reactive nitrogen species.

The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed 21 phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. 22 IMPORTANCE 40 The majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including 41 numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to 42 the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings 43 enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than what was 44 attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore 45 Classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, 46 such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of 47 49
63c8de490d2b494cff5edf10398374305e6b48bf	Current methods for the accurate diagnosis of influenza based on culture of the virus or PCR are highly sensitive and specific but require specialised laboratory facilities and highly trained personnel and, in the case of viral culture, can take up to 14 days to obtain a definitive result. In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance-based immunosensor (QCM) has been developed and its potential evaluated for the rapid and sensitive detection of both influenza A and B viruses in laboratory-cultured preparations and clinical samples. The effective limit for detection by QCM for stock preparations of both A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 viruses was 1 × 10 4 pfu/mL, associated with observed frequency shifts of 30 (±5) and 37 (±6.5) Hz, respectively. Conjugation of 13 nm gold nanoparticles to the detecting antibody improved the mass sensitivity of the immunosensor, resulting in a 10-fold increase in sensitivity and a detection limit of 1 × 10 3 pfu/mL for both preparations, with resulting frequency shifts of 102 (±11) and 115 (±5) Hz, respectively. Detection of virus in nasal washes with this technique was achieved by overnight passage in MDCK cultures prior to analysis. A comparison of results obtained from 67 clinical samples using existing RT-PCR, shell vial, cell culture and ELISA methods showed that QCM techniques were comparable in sensitivity and specificity to cell culture methods.

DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study. SETTLNG: Three senior daycare centers in Rochester, New York. PATIENTS: Frail older persons and staff members of the daycare centers who developed signs or symptoms of an acute respiratory illness MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, medical, and physical findings were recorded on subjects at baseline and during respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal specimens for viral culture as well as acute and convalescent sera for coronavirus 229E enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were obtained for all illnesses. RESULTS: During the 44 months of study, 352 older persons experienced 522 illnesses. Thirty-five (7%) of 522 cultures were positive for rhinovirus and 37 (8%) of 451 serologies were positive for coronavirus 229E infection. The clinical syndromes associated with rhinovirus and coronavirus infection were similar and characterized by nasal congestion, cough, and constitutional symptoms. N o patient died or was hospitalized, but approximately 50% had evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement. The average illness lasted 14 days. During the same period, 113 staff developed 338 respiratory illnesses. Eight percent were identified as coronavirus and 9% as rhinovirus. Cough, sputum production, and constitutional symptoms were significantly more common among older persons. CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus and coronavirus 229E are common causes of moderately debilitating acute respiratory illnesses among older persons attending daycare. J Am Geriatr SOC 45:706-711,1997.
c8a05bc56a89350e68d0a6a559975799566a80ca	In this paper, we propose a software tool, called AMYTISS, implemented in C++/OpenCL, for designing correct-by-construction controllers for large-scale discrete-time stochastic systems. This tool is employed to (i) build finite Markov decision processes (MDPs) as finite abstractions of given original systems, and (ii) synthesize controllers for the constructed finite MDPs satisfying bounded-time high-level properties including safety, reachability and reach-avoid specifications. In AMYTISS, scalable parallel algorithms are designed such that they support the parallel execution within CPUs, GPUs and hardware accelerators (HWAs). Unlike all existing tools for stochastic systems, AMYTISS can utilize high-performance computing (HPC) platforms and cloudcomputing services to mitigate the effects of the state-explosion problem, which is always present in analyzing large-scale stochastic systems. We benchmark AMYTISS against the most recent tools in the literature using several physical case studies including robot examples, room temperature and road traffic networks. We also apply our algorithms to a 3-dimensional autonomous vehicle and 7-dimensional nonlinear model of a BMW 320i car by synthesizing an autonomous parking controller.
a42618a9c35455792841b2210e2323fabfc05227	Background: An efficient public health workforce is necessary for improving and maintaining the health of population and such a workforce can be prepared through proper educational programs and trainings. Objectives: The present study aims to investigate the needs in the public health education programs, as well as need and availability of competent public health workforce in labour market of Saudi Arabia. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was administered in two phases in the college of Health Sciences at the Saudi Electronic University (SEU). The first phase was carried out between September 2015 and December 2015, which involved interview with administrative heads of four health-related organizations. The second phase was performed in September 2017 and June 2018 after starting an undergraduate course in public health at the university. A total of 41 faculty and 408 students from different branches of SEU participated in the online survey. Results: According to administrative head of public health-related organization, there is a shortage of qualified workforce in public health. All the four organizations need workforce with the master degree in sub-speciality epidemiology. About 97.5% students agreed there is a shortage of public health speciality in these organizations. About 92.7% faculty had an opinion that there is a requirement to set-up educational programs in public health. To overcome the shortage of competent workforce, two organizations showed interest in updating their employees' skill through bridging courses. The students perceiving bachelor course in public health showed interest to accomplish master's degree in epidemiology (38.5%), public health education and promotion (36.5%) and infection control (35.5%). There is a shortage of expertise in the public health organizations and there is a need for development of more public health schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The establishment of public health courses especially in the field of epidemiology at undergraduate and graduate level will help in the development of efficient and competent public health workforce.
e4386084ac2c16660c0919c89cbb77567556c395	OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the effect of congestion and decongestive therapy on left atrial (LA) mechanics and to determine the relationship between LA improvement after decongestive therapy and clinical outcome in immediate or chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). BACKGROUND LA mechanics are affected by volume/pressure overload in decompensated HFrEF. METHODS A total of 31 patients with HFrEF and immediate heart failure (age 64 AE 15 years, 74% male, left ventricular ejection fraction 20 AE 12%) underwent serial echocardiography during decongestive therapy with simultaneous hemodynamic monitoring. LA function was assessed by strain (rate) imaging. Patients were re-evaluated 6 weeks after discharge and prospectively followed up for the composite endpoint of heart failure readmission and all-cause mortality. RESULTS LA reservoir function was markedly reduced at baseline and improved with decongestion (peak atrial longitudinal strain from 6.4 AE 2.2% to 8.8 AE 3.0% and strain rate from 0.29 AE 0.11 s -1 to 0.38 AE 0.13 s -1 ), independent of changes in left ventricular global longitudinal strain, LA end-diastolic volume, and mitral regurgitation severity (p < 0.001). Both measures continued to rise at 6 weeks (up to 13.4 AE 6.1% and 0.50 AE 0.19 s -1 , respectively; p < 0.001). LA pump strain rate only increased 6 weeks after discharge (-0.25 AE 0.12 s -1 to -0.55 AE 0.29 s -1 ; p < 0.010). Changes in LA mechanics correlated with changes in wedge pressure (r ¼ -0.61; p < 0.001). Lower peak atrial longitudinal strain values after decongestion were associated with increased risk for the composite endpoint of heart failure and mortality (p < 0.019). CONCLUSIONS LA reservoir and booster function, while severely impaired during immediate decompensation, significantly improve during and after decongestive therapy. Poor LA reservoir function after decongestion is associated with worse outcome. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2020;13:1107-15) 
e58ab071997054776d058d40cd83ce1035269cde	Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of caffeine citrate in the treatment of apnea in bronchiolitis. Study design Eligible infants aged #4 months presenting to the main pediatric emergency service with apnea associated bronchiolitis were stratified by gestational age (<34 weeks or longer) and randomized to receive a single dose of intravenous 25 mg/kg caffeine citrate or saline placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was a 24-hour apnea-free period beginning after completion of the blinded study drug infusion. Secondary outcomes were frequency of apnea by 24, 48, and 72 hours after study medication, need for noninvasive/invasive ventilation, and length of stay in the hospital's pediatric intensive care/step-down unit. Results A total of 90 infants diagnosed with viral bronchiolitis associated with apnea (median age, 38 days) were enrolled. The rate of respiratory virus panel positivity was similar in the 2 groups (78% for the placebo group vs 84% for the caffeine group). The geometric mean duration to a 24-hour apnea-free period was 28.1 hours (95% CI, 25.6-32.3 hours) for the caffeine group and 29.1 hours (95% CI, 25.7-32.9 hours) for the placebo group (P = .88; OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83-1.17). The frequency of apnea at 24 hours, 24-48 hours, and 48-72 hours after enrollment and the need for noninvasive and invasive ventilation were similar in the 2 groups. No safety issues were reported. Conclusions A single dose of caffeine citrate did not significantly reduce apnea episodes associated with bronchiolitis. (J Pediatr 2016;177:204-11). Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01435486. V iral bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants, leading to 15 hospitalizations per 1000 person-years. Of these, 1.6% to 4% are admitted with apnea. 1-4 Bronchiolitis-associated apnea, a subset of apnea associated with respiratory viruses, appears to be a mixed central and obstructive apnea resulting from a complex interplay of respiratory drive suppression and airway secretions driven by a hyperactive laryngochemoreflex, somnogenic cytokines, and in some cases by virus-specific respiratory suppressant surface proteins. [5] [6] [7] Caffeine is a standard treatment for apnea of prematurity 8,9 and postextubation apnea in preterm infants, 10 and has been used to ameliorate apnea complicating bronchiolitis on the basis of case reports and observational studies. 11-17 Caffeine increases central respiratory drive and chemoreceptor sensitivity to CO 2 and improves skeletal muscle contractions, reducing diaphragm fatigue and leading to better ventilation. 18 Increased metabolic demand, diuresis, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, feeding intolerance, reduced weight gain, and seizures are the reported short-term side effect of caffeine. 19 Although evidence from prospective studies for caffeine used to treat apnea in bronchiolitis is lacking, the drug is commonly used in an attempt to avoid intubation and is considered a standard of care in some institutions. 11,17,20 Thus, we compared blinded intravenous caffeine citrate with placebo for shortening the time to resolution of acute bronchiolitis-associated apnea.
3f551bf91d2b52cadac39dbd62e7ae0f51066446	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has generated enormous interest in the biodiversity, genomics and cross-species transmission potential of coronaviruses, especially those from bats, the second most speciose order of mammals. Herein, we identified a novel coronavirus, provisionally designated Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1), in the rectal swab samples of Rousettus leschenaulti bats by using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Although the virus is similar to Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9) in genome characteristics, it is sufficiently distinct to be classified as a new species according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). More striking was that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 contained a unique gene integrated into the 3'-end of the genome that has no homologs in any known coronavirus, but which sequence and phylogeny analyses indicated most likely originated from the p10 gene of a bat orthoreovirus. Subgenomic mRNA and cellular-level observations demonstrated that the p10 gene is functional and induces the formation of cell syncytia. Therefore, here we report a putative heterologous inter-family recombination event between a single-stranded, positive-sense PLOS Pathogens |
8465991de36a1cbc3d152909ad98ba8ee7aeaada	Introduction: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to reduce transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 . However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. Methods: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data from January -June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number ( R t ) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in R t , levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. Results: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced R t . Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g., restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <10 people gathering was). Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Conclusion: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications taking into account these effects, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many although not all the actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
7dbe0bb2d5bfc8c90c1a0185c6ea608452b08276	Simple Summary: Pecking-related problems are common in intensive egg production, diminishing hen welfare and production performance, and negatively affecting sustainability. Beak trimming is a common practice to control these problems, but in Finland beak trimming is prohibited. Finnish egg producers have decades-long experience of egg production with intact-beaked hens. This experience, and their management of pecking-related problems, could benefit producers in other countries. The online questionnaire aimed to gather information about Finnish farmers' attitudes towards beak trimming, their estimation of the seriousness of pecking problems in their laying hen flocks, common risk factors and the best practices to prevent attendant problems. The questionnaire received 35 responses. Finnish egg producers appeared strongly to support a policy of not trimming beaks. Motivation against beak trimming was explained by considering it to be unnecessary and unethical. Most respondents did not regard pecking-related problems as being very severe in their flocks. Lighting, feeding and flock management problems represented the most important risk factors regarding pecking problems. Generally, the same topics were highlighted as being the most important intervention measures for managing an on-going pecking problem. The study indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy as a component of sustainable egg production. Abstract: Pecking-related problems are common in intensive egg production, compromising hen welfare, causing farmers economic losses and negatively affecting sustainability. These problems are often controlled by beak trimming, which in Finland is prohibited. An online questionnaire aimed to collect information from farmers about pecking-related problems in Finnish laying hen flocks, important risk factors and the best experiences to prevent the problems. Additionally, the farmers' attitudes towards beak trimming were examined. We received 35 responses, which represents about 13% of all Finnish laying hen farms with ≥300 laying hens. The majority of respondents stated that a maximum of 5-7% incidence of feather pecking or 1-2% incidence of cannibalism would be tolerable. The majority of respondents (74%) expressed that they would definitely not use beak-trimmed hens. Only two respondents indicated that they would probably use beak-trimmed hens were the practice permitted. Among risk factors, light intensity earned the highest mean (6.3), on a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important). Other important problems included those that occurred during rearing, feeding, flock management and problems with drinking water equipment (mean 5.9, each). The most important intervention measures included optimal lighting and feeding, flock management, and removing the pecker and victim. Concluding, Finnish farmers had strong negative attitudes towards beak trimming. The study underlines the importance of flock management, especially lighting and feeding, in preventing pecking problems and indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy into sustainable egg production.
d9b51d8b476f9fa6d4c7679c3654056ae0402aa0	Metal ions are integral part of some viral proteins and play an important role in their survival and pathogenesis. Zinc, magnesium and copper are the commonest metal ion that binds with viral proteins. Metal ions participate in maturation of genomic RNA, activation and catalytic mechanisms, reverse transcription, initial integration process and protection of newly synthesized DNA, inhibition of proton translocation (M2 protein), minus-and plus-strand transfer, enhance nucleic acid annealing, activation of transcription, integration of viral DNA into specific sites and act as a chaperone of nucleic acid. Metal ions are also required for nucleocapsid protein-transactivation response (TAR)-RNA interactions. In certain situations more than one metal ion is required e.g. RNA cleavage by RNase H. This review underscores the importance of metal ions in the survival and pathogenesis of a large group of viruses and studies on structural basis for metal binding should prove useful in the early design and development of viral inhibitors.
cbdb14873c6307ee99ea9b754069aa394eee5051	An ultrametric model of epidemic spread of infections based on the classical SIR model is proposed. Ultrametrics on a set of individuals is introduced based on their hierarchical clustering relative to the average time of infection contact. The general equations of the ultrametric SIR model are written down and their particular implementation using the p-adic parametrization is presented. A numerical analysis of the p-adic SIR model and a comparison of its behavior with the classical SIR model are performed. The concept of hierarchical isolation and the scenario of its management in order to reduce the level of epidemic spread is considered.
957ab1fcf790e8dd9d681f1f216287db1177cb78	A brief description of the importance of communicable diseases in history and the development of mathematical modelling of disease transmission is given. This includes reasons for mathematical modelling, the history of mathematical modelling from the foundations laid in the late nineteenth century to the present, some of the accomplishments of mathematical modelling, and some challenges for the future. Our purpose is to demonstrate the importance of mathematical modelling for the understanding and management of infectious disease transmission.
9c940298ee86fe96bd26a793b6498755794cd254	Accumulating evidence indicates that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronaviruses (BatCoVs). Previously, we demonstrated that both MERS-CoV and BatCoV HKU4 use CD26 as a receptor, but how the BatCoVs evolved to bind CD26 is an intriguing question. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the S1 subunit C-terminal domain of HKU5 (HKU5-CTD), another BatCoV that is phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV but cannot bind to CD26. We observed that the conserved core subdomain and those of other betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) have a similar topology of the external subdomain, indicating the same ancestor of lineage C betaCoVs. However, two deletions in two respective loops located in HKU5-CTD result in conformational variations in CD26-binding interface and are responsible for the non-binding of HKU5-CTD to CD26. Combined with sequence variation in the HKU5-CTD receptor binding interface, we propose the necessity for surveilling the mutation in BatCoV HKU5 spike protein in case of bat-to-human interspecies transmission.
0c88aafc785d38c63366e384c8a404cbc596aa99	The popularization of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) brings an opportunity to use Question Answering Systems to consult these sources using natural language. We present CONQUEST, a framework that automates much of the process of building chatbots for the Template-Based Interactive Question Answering task on EKGs. The framework automatically handles the processes of construction of the Natural Language Processing engine, construction of the question classification mechanism, definition of the system interaction flow, construction of the EKG query mechanism, and finally, the construction of the user interaction interface. CONQUEST uses a machine learning-based mechanism to classify input questions to known templates extracted from EKGs, utilizing the clarification dialog to resolve inconclusive classifications and request mandatory missing parameters. CONQUEST also evolves with question clarification: these cases define question patterns used as new examples for training.
8fb6c146ef4060c92be87a5ce4b3e6aa228f9461	This interview with Teesta Setalvad was conducted in the wake of the February 2020 anti-Muslim violence in North East Delhi. Drawing on her vast experience as a human rights activist, journalist, and peace educator, Setalvad's responses map the continuum -across years, anti-minority pogroms and ruling parties with divergent ideologies -of the cultures of hate, and the practices of state repression and impunity in a proto-fascist India. Setalvad offers an interrogation of the ideology of the Hindu right, delves into the historical trajectories of the rise of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She also charts the repeating patterns of police and media complicity in fomenting anti-minority hate and critically analyses the contradictory role of the criminal law and the Constitution of India in both enabling and resisting communal violence. In conclusion, she offers hopeful strategies for keeping alive the promise of secularism.
e294d06f78dfc78efb03a686f61f138d38751d84	Health care workers (HCWs) often suffer the brunt of injuries during chemical, biological radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) events. Throughout history, those caring for the injured, dying and dead put themselves at risk of harm, infection or contamination. Recent events include the 2014-2016 infectious outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa and the targeting of health facilities in the conflict in Syria. Decisions by HCWs to care for others in the face of such risks have been lauded as heroic whether undertaken for personal moral reasons or in response to an ethical duty to care. However, some have questioned whether such a duty to care is ethically obligatory in the face of some CBRNE events. Ethical analysis of the SARS outbreak found that additional ethical reflection was needed on HCWs' obligations during CBRNE events. The ethical arguments used to justify the duty to care are reviewed in this chapter. However, other duties exist for HCWs which may conflict with the duty to care. The World Health Organization's guidance on ethics in pandemics notes that the duty to provide care in pandemics is not unlimited, and that employers and governments have reciprocal obligations to provide training and protective equipment to HCWs during CBRNE. Empirical research raises questions about whether health care organisations are adequately prepared for CBRNE, particularly for the ethical decision-making that will be required. Rather than taking a regulatory or legal approach to this issue, this chapter will argue that the ethical virtues of courage and volunteerism should be fostered in HCW training. In keeping with a virtue ethics approach, leadership takes on an important role in ethical decision-making, as well as praising those who respond to CBRNE by caring for others in spite of the personal risks and their conflicting obligations.
6a6bd107c17007857d566a33523b29db491b919a	This research quantifies the various South African lockdown regimes, for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in terms of the basic reproduction number, r 0 . It further calculates the levels of immunity required for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work, then predicts their perceived values, should infections have been underestimated by a factor of 10. The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number (r 0 = 1.93) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-3 lockdown was found to be 2.34 and that of the level-4 lockdown, 1.69. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally 'smarter' than the 'harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the everpresent error associated with data sets, in general. The pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be 3.16, in the Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic.
c8f9c1b066f06fcad8d6257e136a4a27e45ae858	Successful conservation plans are not solely achieved by acquiring optimally designed reserves. Ongoing monitoring and management of the biodiversity in those reserves is an equally important, but often neglected or poorly executed, part of the conservation process. In this paper we address one of the first and most important steps in designing a monitoring program -deciding what to monitor. We present a strategy for prioritizing species for monitoring and management in multispecies conservation plans. We use existing assessments of threatened status, and the degree and spatial and temporal extent of known threats to link the prioritization of species to the overarching goals and objectives of the conservation plan. We consider both broad and localized spatial scales to capture the regional conservation context and the practicalities of local management and monitoring constraints. Spatial scales that are commensurate with available data are selected. We demonstrate the utility of this strategy through application to a set of 85 plants and animals in an established multispecies conservation plan in San Diego County, California, USA. We use the prioritization to identify the most prominent risk factors and the habitats associated with the most threats to species. The protocol highlighted priorities that had not previously been identified and were not necessarily intuitive without systematic application of the criteria; many high-priority species have received no monitoring attention to date, and lower-priority species have. We recommend that in the absence of clear focal species, monitoring threats in highly impacted habitats may be a way to circumvent the need to monitor all the targeted species.
fc84e71201caa08697552bc57debc8f80135fd3f	The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a multifaceted lung disorder in which no specific therapeutic intervention is able to effectively improve clinical outcomes. Despite an improved understanding of molecular mechanisms and advances in supportive care strategies, ARDS remains associated with high mortality, and survivors usually face longterm morbidity. In recent years, preclinical studies have provided mounting evidence of the potential of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies in lung diseases and critical illnesses. In several models of ARDS, MSCs have been demonstrated to induce antiinflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, improve epithelial and endothelial cell recovery, and enhance microbial and alveolar fluid clearance, thus resulting in improved lung and distal organ function and survival. Early-stage clinical trials have also demonstrated the safety of MSC administration in patients with ARDS, but further, large-scale investigations are required to assess the safety and efficacy profile of these therapies. In this review, we summarize the main mechanisms whereby MSCs have been shown to exert therapeutic effects in experimental ARDS. We also highlight questions that need to be further elucidated and barriers that must be overcome in order to efficiently translate MSC research into clinical practice.
b0d1470257ee2c01aea71fe48158b3a129c6e440	Background: In Western settings, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) is relatively rare. Previous studies from Asia, however, indicate a higher prevalence of GNB in CAP, but data, particularly from Southeast Asia, are limited. Methods: This is a prospective observational study of 1451 patients ≥15 y of age with CAP from two hospitals in Cambodia between 2007 and 2010. The proportion of GNB was estimated. Risk factors and clinical characteristics of CAP due to GNB were assessed using logistic regression models. Results: The prevalence of GNB was 8.6% in all CAP patients and 15.8% among those with a valid respiratory sample. GNB infection was independently associated with diabetes, higher leucocyte count and CAP severity. Mortality was higher in patients with CAP due to GNB. We found a high proportion of GNB in a population hospitalized for CAP in Cambodia. Given the complex antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of certain GNBs and the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant GNB, microbiological laboratory capacity should be strengthened and prospective clinical trials comparing empiric treatment algorithms according to the severity of CAP are needed.
f5b40d2f1601e017acf7c68ff5a819d5a767ec7d	High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a widely used ventilatory support in children with bronchiolitis in the intensive care setting. No data is available on HFNC use in the general pediatric ward. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of HFNC oxygen therapy in infants hospitalized in a pediatric ward for moderate-severe bronchiolitis and to assess the changes in ventilatory parameters before and after starting HFNC support. This prospective observational pilot study was carried out during the bronchiolitis season 2011-2012 in a pediatric tertiary care academic center in Italy. Interruptions of HFNC therapy and possible side effects or escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2 ), and respiratory rate (RR), measured for a baseline period of 1 h before and at specific time intervals in 48 h after the start of HFNC were recorded. Twenty-seven infants were included (median age 1.3 months; absolute range 0.3-8.5). No adverse events, no premature HFNC therapy termination, and no escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Median SpO 2 significantly increased by 1-2 points after changing from standard oxygen to HFNC (p <0.001). Median ETCO 2 and RR rapidly decreased by 6-8 mmHg and 13-20 breaths per minute, respectively, in the first 3 h of HFNC therapy (p <0.001) and remained steady thereafter. Conclusions: Use of HFNC for oxygen administration is feasible for infants with moderate-severe bronchiolitis in a general pediatric ward. In these children, HFNC therapy improves oxygen saturation levels and seems to be associated with a decrease in both ETCO 2 and RR.
d7043741123337c06637ea3e19158c4307284b7b	As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, understanding how patterns of human mobility and connectivity affect outbreak dynamics, especially before outbreaks establish locally, is critical for informing response efforts.
28f9bbcabe91651abf73295c381a770b38af4542	Humanity has seen numerous pandemics during its course of evolution. The list includes many 14 such as measles, Ebola, SARS, MERS, etc. Latest edition to this pandemic list is 15 caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As of 4th July 2020, COVID-19 has affected over 16 10 million people from 170+ countries, and 5,28,364 deaths. Genomic technologies have enabled 17 us to understand the genomic constitution of the pathogens, their virulence, evolution, rate of 18 mutations, etc. To date, more than 60,000 virus genomes have been deposited in the public 19 depositories like GISAID and NCBI. While we are writing this, India is the 3rd most-affected 20 country with COVID-19 with 0.6 million cases, and >18000 deaths. Gujarat is the fourth highest 21 affected state with 5.44 percent death rate compared to national average of 2.8 percent. Here, 361 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Gujarat have been sequenced and analyzed in order 23 to understand its phylogenetic distribution and variants against global and national sequences. Further, variants were analyzed from diseased and recovered patients from Gujarat and the World 25 to understand its role in pathogenesis. From missense mutations, found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-26 2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in nucleocapsid (N) gene was found to be significantly 27 associated with mortality in patients. The other significant deleterious variant found in diseased 28 patients from Gujarat and the world is G25563T, which is located in Orf3a and has a potential role 29 2 in viral pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Gujarat are forming distinct cluster under GH 30 clade of GISAID. 31 analysis 33 34 As per the recent situation report-166 released by the World Health Organisation (WHO), as 35 accessed on 4 th July 2020, total confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 across the globe are 36 10,922,324 resulting in 5,23,011 deaths. In many countries like China, Spain, Australia, Japan, 37 South Korea, and USA, the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections has started (Xu and Li 2020; 38 Leung et al. 2020; Strzelecki 2020; Trade et al. 2020). India is the third most affected country 39 by COVID-19 after the USA and Brazil, with 6,48,315 cases and 18,655 deaths, respectively. 40 Gujarat, located in the western part of India, is the fourth highest affected state in the world, with 41 36,123 cases and 1944 deaths. However, the death rate is 5.44%, which is almost two times higher 42 than national average, with a recovery rate of 71.69% in the state of Gujarat, India. Therefore, 43 understanding the pathogen evolution and virulence through genome sequencing will be key to 44 understanding its diversity, variation and its effect on pathogenesis and disease severity. Global 45 depositories like GISAID and NCBI databases are flooded with SARS-CoV-2 genomes with an 46 average of 306 genomes per day being added from across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 genome size is 47 29 to 30.6 kb. The genome includes 10 genes which encode four structural and 16 non-structural 48 proteins. Structural proteins are encoded by the four structural genes, including spike (S), envelope 49 (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes. The ORF1ab is the largest gene in SARS-CoV-50 2, which encodes the pp1ab protein and 15 non-structural proteins (nsps). The ORF1a gene 51 encodes for pp1a protein, which also contains 10 nsps (Shereen et al. 2020; Du et al. 2009). In the present study, the whole genome of 361 SARS-CoV-2 from Gujarat have been sequenced 53 and analyzed against 792 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, with the known patient status. The overall dataset comprises 277 confirmed positive COVID-19 patients, which included 100 55 females and 177 male patients. These genomes were studied against a total of 57,043 complete 56 viral genome sequences as accessed on 4 th July 2020 to characterize their clades and variants 57 distribution. Further statistical tools were applied to understand the differences in the variants with 58 respect to disease epidemiology. In absence of the clinically approved drugs, vaccine, and possible 59 therapy in treating COVID-19, tracking pathogen evolution through whole genome sequencing 60 can be a very good tool in understanding the progression of pandemic locally as well as globally. 61 3 This will also help in devising strategies for vaccine development, potential drug targets and host-62 pathogen interactions. 63 Results 64 Samples were collected on the basis of COVID-19 incidence rate from across Gujarat from 13 65 different originating labs representing a total of 38 geographical locations from 18 districts of 66 Gujarat, India Supplemental Table 01. The geographical distribution of the top three locations of 67 viral isolates are represented by Ahmedabad (n=125), Surat (n=65), and Vadodara (n=53). Total 68 361 viral genomes from 277 patients have been sequenced in the study from which 132 were from 69 females while 229 were from males. These patients were from 1 year to 86 years of age group with 70 an average age of 47.80 yrs. Most of the COVID-19 positive patients had the symptoms of fever, 71 diarrhoea, cough and breathing problems while some of them had the comorbid condition like 72 hypertension and diabetes etc. The final outcome of these patients were classified as deceased, 73 recovered, hospitalized or unknown status for further data analysis based on the available metadata 74 information. These details are presented in Supplemental Table S2. Similarly, a data set of around 75 57,043 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (up to 4 th July, 2020) downloaded from GISAID server 76 and classified as per the patient status mentioned above. Chi-square test was performed to test the 77 effect of gender and age group for Gujarat and global dataset. The female patients (at p-value 78 0.0240) in Gujarat dataset were observed to be at significantly higher death rate as compared to 79 global dataset in deceased and recovered patients. The genomic dataset was further divided into 80 different age groups of up to 40, 41-60 and over 60 years. The results indicated a significantly 81 higher mortality rate at the age groups of 41-60 (at p-value 0.0391) and over 60 years in Gujarat 82 (at p-value of 0.3932) compared against age groups in the global dataset. Mutation frequency 83 profile of the Gujarat genome with the mutation spectrum is highlighted in Figure 1. including 84 synonymous and missense mutations. 85 4 86 Figure 1: Mutation spectrum profile of 361 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates sampled from 38 87 locations representing 18 districts of Gujarat, India including synonymous and missense mutation. 88 The top mutations included C241T, C3037T, C14408T/Pro314Leu, C18877T, 89 A23403G/Asp614Gly, G25563T/Gln57His and C26735T with frequency >50%. 90 Genome sequencing: From a total of 277 patients, 84 had mixed infections. Mixed infections 91 were judged by frequency of heterozygous mutations. Heterozygous mutation was considered only 92 if it was supported by forward and reverse reads of an amplicon and 168 viral genomes were 93 classified as two different haplotypes from 84 patients, and were observed with heterozygous allele 94 frequencies and were manually divided in two genomes annotated with suffix "a" and "b".

34e4b49c46c5462089f516983eeb19a6aff69d01	Monocytes are a heterogeneous population of bone marrow-derived cells that are recruited to sites of infection and inflammation in many models of human diseases, including those of the central nervous system (CNS). Ly6C hi / CCR2 hi inflammatory monocytes have been identified as the circulating precursors of brain macrophages, dendritic cells and arguably microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; Alzheimer's disease; stroke; and more recently in CNS infection caused by Herpes simplex virus, murine hepatitis virus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The precise differentiation pathways and functions of inflammatory monocyte-derived populations in the inflamed CNS remains a contentious issue, especially in regard to the existence of monocyte-derived microglia. Furthermore, the contributions of monocyte-derived subsets to viral clearance and immunopathology are not well-defined. Thus, understanding the pathways through which inflammatory monocytes migrate to the brain and their functional capacity within the CNS is critical to inform future therapeutic strategies. This review discusses some of the key aspects of inflammatory monocyte trafficking to the brain and addresses the role of these cells in viral encephalitis.

SARS-CoV-2 is proposed to cause AKI in the patients through various mechanisms. We are, nevertheless, far from a comprehensive understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the kidney injury in this infection. AKI has been shown to be a marker of disease severity and also a negative prognostic factor for survival. Unfortunately, no effective preventive strategy to decrease the risk of kidney damage in these patients has yet been identified. In this hypothesis, we highlight the potential protective effects of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in preventing the proximal tubular damage caused by the virus through disrupting the virus-endosome fusion and also interfering with the lysosomal proteases. Our proposed mechanisms could pave the way for further in vitro studies and subsequent clinical trials.

We show that decidability in P is preserved if we also assume that certain function symbols f are extensional in the sense that f (s1, . . . , sn) ≈ f (t1, . . . , tn) implies s1 ≈ t1, . . . , sn ≈ tn. In addition, we investigate a variant of extensionality that is more appropriate for commutative function symbols, but which raises the complexity of the word problem to coNP.
2aac4f808ecf429a389fb473ebd06e44b152db6d	Background: MERS-CoV emerged as a zoonotic disease in Saudi Arabia with 1437 cases as of July 2016. This study aimed at describing the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection, clinical aspects of the disease and the determinants of survival. Methods: The medical records of Prince Mohamed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital were reviewed between April 2014 and December 2015 to identify admission and discharge with MERS-CoV. Patient's characteristics, epidemiologic and clinical data and laboratory results were extracted and described. Logistic regression analyses were used to model the determinants of the survival of these patients. Significance of the results were judged at the 5% level. Results: 249 confirmed cases were admitted mostly in August (20.48%) and September (14.86%) of the year 2015. A third (39.36%) reported contact with an index case, developed the disease after 6.2 days and continued to shed the virus for 13.17 days on average. The case fatality rate was 20.08%. Independent predictors of being discharged alive among confirmed cases were younger age (OR A = 0.953), breathing ambient air (OR A = 8.981), not being transferred to the ICU (OR A = 24.240) and not receiving renal replacement therapy (OR A = 8.342). These variables explain 63.9% of the variability of patients' status at discharge. Conclusion: MERS-CoV spread from human-to-human as community acquired and nosocomial infection. The study identified high risk patients in need for special medical attention in order to improve patients' outcome.
95a3dd795aae98c72f31e3488f368c894edac68b	Education has traditionally been classroom-oriented with a gradual growth of online courses in recent times. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated the shift to online classes. Associated with this learning format is the question: what do people think about the educational value of an online course compared to a course taken in-person in a classroom? This paper addresses the question and presents a Bayesian quantile analysis of public opinion using a nationally representative survey data from the United States. Our findings show that previous participation in online courses and full-time employment status favor the educational value of online courses. We also find that the older demographic and females have a greater propensity for online education. In contrast, highly educated individuals have a lower willingness towards online education vis--vis traditional classes. Besides, covariate effects show heterogeneity across quantiles which cannot be captured using probit or logit models. JEL codes: A20, C11, C31, C35, I20, I29 .in (Manini Ojha), marshad@iitk.ac.in (Mohammad Arshad Rahman) 1 Roughly one in two individuals who have graduated in the last ten years have taken at least one online course in their degree program (Parker et al., 2011) .
e8afd9eeaaf3fa5e2ef88e743a971e2bab79890f	We propose two-stage adaptive pooling schemes, 2-STAP and 2-STAMP, for detecting COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test kits. Similar to the Tapestry scheme of Ghosh et al., the proposed schemes leverage soft information from the RT-qPCR process about the total viral load in the pool. This is in contrast to conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used Dorfman's scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfman's scheme. The proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of Ghosh et al. (Tapestry) show that 10 infected people in a population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a sensitivity of 99.50% and specificity of 99.62%. This is 13.5x, 4.24x, and 1.3x the testing throughput of individual testing, Dorfman's testing, and the Tapestry scheme, respectively.
c527438049b676f616cfaa429333081f0e4e602d	Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2], COVID-2019 [coronavirus disease 2019], or 2019-nCoV [2019 novel coronavirus]) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. The previous epidemics of infections by high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in nonhuman animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-IFN-␤) was shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-IFN-␤ also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-IFN-␤ against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mouse model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have suggested that proinflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This minireview aims to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that have shown potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.
a3bfa013f6e148d0e99ecdfcfda3cb6fed09a826	Summary. The Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome with acute progressive lung function deterioration based on increased pulmonary permeability and caused mostly by non-pulmonary lesions (like sepsis or polytrauma), occasionally also by pulmonary diseases (like pneumonia) or intoxications (e.g. by paraquat). In the complex, interactive pathomechanisms (e.g. complement activation, stimulation of the arachidon metabolism) with release of numerous damaging mediators the massive accumulation of neutrophils in the lung plays an important role. Zusammenfassnng. Das akute Lungenversagen (ARDS = ,,Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome") ist ein klinisches Syndrom rasch progressiver respiratorischer Insuffizienz auf dem Boden einer schweren Permeabilit~itsst6rung der Lunge. Ausl6send sind meist systemische Noxe (z. B. Sepsis, Polytrauma), seltener pulmonale Sch~idigungen (z. B. Pneumonie) oder Intoxikationen. In vielschichtigen, interaktiven Pathomechanismen (wie Komplement-Aktivierung, Stimulation des Arachidonsfiure-Stoffwechsels) mit Freisetzung zahlreicher Mediatoren spielt die massive Kumulation neutrophiler Granulocyten in der Lunge eine bedeutende Rolle. Sehliisselw6rter: Akutes Lungenversagen (ARDS) -Pulmonale Granulocytose -Pathomechanismen -Intensivmedizin. Das ,,Akute Lungenversagen", dieses recht junge Krankheitsbild aus der Intensivmedizin, irritiert durch seine Wechselhaftigkeit: In der kurzen Zeit seines bisherigen Auftretens ~inderten sich wiederholt die ~itiologischen und pathogenetischen Vorstellungen, wechselten die therapeutischen Konzepte. Die Problematik beginnt bereits mit dem Namen: Als in den spU.ten 60er Jahren das Krankheitsbild bekannt wurde, hiel3 es ,,Congestive atelectasis" oder (nach dem dominierenden Auftreten auf damaligen Kriegsschaupl~itzen) ,,Da-Nang-Lung"; seitdem sind fiber 52 Synonyma vorgeschlagen worden. Sp~iter gewann die Bezeichnung ,,Schocklunge" allgemeine Verbreitung; diese Bezeichnung ist jedoch trfigerisch, da sie eine ~itiologische Bindung vort~iuscht, die keinesfalls immer gegeben ist. Heute heiBt es im angels~ichsischen Sprachgebrauch ARDS = ,,Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome" (in Analogie zum RDS des Frfihgeborenen, mit dem es aber nur morphologisch eine gewisse )~hnlichkeit aufweist). Im deutschen Sprachraum ist es bekannt als ,,Akutes Lungenversagen", eine unscheinbare Bezeichnung, die zumindest nichts deutet (also keine ~itiologische Hypothese verkiindet), sondern nur besagt, dab es sich um eine pl6tzlich auftretende (progrediente) Ateminsuffizienz handelt. Die Schwierigkeiten bereits bei der Namensgebung h~ingen eng zusammen mit dernur wenig konkreten Definition des Krankheitsbildes.
22bbb20ac3f96141fe6f89bcc3fca37b4fd1f0f5	In response to the global pandemic of the last four months, some progress has been made in understanding the molecular-level host interactions of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. However, when the virus enters the body it interacts not only with the host but also with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-hostmicrobiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by the viral invasion. We carry out a comparative functional analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight COVID-19, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients and twenty healthy controls. The resulting functional profiles clearly separate the cohorts, even more sharply than just their corresponding taxonomic profiles. We also detect distinct pathway signatures in the respiratory tract microbiome that consistently distinguish COVID-19 patients from both the CAP and healthy cohorts. These include increased vitamin, drug, nucleotide, and energy metabolism during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contrasted with decreased amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. This comparative analysis indicates consistent differences in COVID-19 respiratory tract metatranscriptomes compared to CAP and healthy samples.
528d4fca388e92284c71f3fb069a2fb0b252d9b6	The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or sequencing. However, these tests might not be available in an emergency setting. Computed tomography (CT) can be used as an important complement for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in the current epidemic context. In this review, we present the typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia and discuss the main differential diagnosis.
e15ca4f485de7d850d28f7424228c543f0d66b19	A strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), SHXB, was isolated in Shanghai, China. The complete genome of strain SHXB was sequenced, and its sequence was compared those of other TGEV strains in the GenBank database. The comparison showed that there were no insertions or deletions in the 5 0 and 3 0 -nontranslated regions, in the nonstructural genes ORF1, ORF3, and ORF7, or in the genes encoding the structural proteins envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N). A phenomenon in common with other strains was that nucleotide (nt) 655 of the spike (S) gene was G, and a common change in nt 1753 of the S gene was a T-to-G mutation that caused a serine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 585, which is in the region of the main major antigenic sites A and B of the TGEV S protein. A 6-nt deletion was also found at nt 1123-1128 in all Purdue strains except the strain Virulent Purdue. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TGEV SHXB was closely related to the Purdue strains and shared a common ancestor with the Miller strains as well as strain PRCV-ISU-1.

4041dbdf50df73b5c4dd4f9d11f74c7335c33564	S epsis is a common clinical syndrome arising from a dysregulated host response to systemic infection leading to lifethreatening end-organ damage 1 . While the incidence of sepsis varies 2 , the substantial burden of critical illness reflects an aging and susceptible population with escalating comorbid conditions 3, 4 . With the exception of early antibiotics and fluids 5-7 , targeted new therapies for sepsis have remained elusive 8 . However, through research, our understanding of sepsis has evolved from being seen solely as an exuberant host immune response 9 to the intersection of pro-and anti-inflammatory, endothelial, coagulation, metabolic, endocrine, and neural pathways 10,11 . The foundation of such research has been the use of small animals in studies to unravel mechanisms of sepsis pathophysiology and develop novel therapeutics 12,13 . This review briefly presents the common nonhuman primate (NHP) models of bacterial sepsis and summarizes the contributions to our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and drug discovery, and how they might impact on future targeted research. An ideal animal model of sepsis must balance biological feasibility and practical considerations. The animal species should recapitulate the same hemodynamic changes to infection seen in humans, such as hypotension, low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and a compensatory increase in cardiac output (CO) following fluid resuscitation [14] [15] [16] . Animals should also demonstrate similar signs and symptoms of infection, such as decreased activity or oral intake, change in body temperature, and change in white blood cell count 12 . The model should include provision of antibiotics 17,18 , a standard of care treatment for patients 1 that may alter host cytokine responses 19 and significantly improves survival 20 . The species should also activate similar molecular pathways, such as cytokine release in response to circulating pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 11 , and should lead to development of multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) 21, 22 . Practically, the model must be economically reasonable, easy to support, and large enough for the collection of physiological data. The earliest and most widely used animal species for sepsis studies has been rats and mice. Murines are attractive because they are inexpensive, easy to breed, versatile, and genetically modifiable 8,12,13 . The rat model of endotoxemic sepsis with fluid resuscitation relies on intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic the physiological responses of Gram-negative sepsis in humans. Unlike human sepsis, which is a protracted response to live pathogens, LPS induces a rapid, transient inflammatory surge that causes mainly vascular injury 13 . The rat cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) technique was developed to mimic human abdominal sepsis from live polymicrobial bacteria 12,23,24 . Though this model has been widely considered the gold standard for rodent studies, it is limited by variability in technique (e.g. number of punctures, size of puncture) 23 and pathogen (e.g. polymicrobial) 24 . As an alternative rat model, the monomicrobial Staphylococcus aureus impregnated clot model of peritoneal sepsis was developed to simulate post-operative abdominal wound infections 25 . Another model using intravenous injection of live bacteria simulates the bacteremia seen in up to 69% of human septic shock 24 , but does so by artificially infusing a large inoculum of bacteria into the bloodstream rather than by slow release from an established nidus of infection 12 . Rodent models suffer from important technical limitations. Their small size makes invasive hemodynamic monitoring difficult, and their small total blood volume (approximately 2 ml in mice and 20 ml in rats) limits serial phlebotomy 23 . Mice are also more resistant to LPS and bacterial pathogens than are humans, requiring 10 4 -to 10 5 -fold higher doses to achieve shock 8,13,24 . Once shock develops, the hemodynamic and cytokine profiles of small rodents differ greatly from those of humans 8,24 , though the inconsistent use of fluid resuscitation in these studies may have affected the results. The sizable technical and biological challenges ultimately led to the use of larger mammals such as rabbits, sheep, dogs, and pigs, whose sizes permitted invasive and serial procedures 12,23 . Many large animals also exhibit sepsis physiology that is similar to humans. For instance, pigs are prone to sepsis-induced capillary leak and development of pulmonary edema, and sheep display similar hyperdynamic responses (i.e. elevated heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen delivery with depressed systemic vascular resistance) to endotoxin Sepsis involves a disordered host response to systemic infection leading to high morbidity and mortality. Despite intense research, targeted sepsis therapies beyond antibiotics have remained elusive. The cornerstone of sepsis research is the development of animal models to mimic human bacterial infections and test novel pharmacologic targets. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have served as an attractive, but expensive, animal to model human bacterial infections due to their nearly identical cardiopulmonary anatomy and physiology, as well as host response to infection. Several NHP species have provided substantial insight into sepsis-mediated inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, acute lung injury, and multi-organ failure. The use of NHPs has usually focused on translating therapies from early preclinical models to human clinical trials. However, despite successful sepsis interventions in NHP models, there are still no FDA-approved sepsis therapies. This review highlights major NHP models of bacterial sepsis and their relevance to clinical medicine. LaB aNimaL | VOL 48 | FEBRUARY 2019 | 57-65 | www.nature.com/laban 57

f199302906b16af52c8f3ac31fb70a39f42a16b3	Infectious bronchitis virus (Gammacoronavirus, Coronaviridae) is a genetically variable RNA virus that causes one of the most persistent respiratory diseases in poultry. The virus is classified in genotypes and lineages with different epidemiological relevance. Two lineages of the GI genotype (11 and 16) have been widely circulating for decades in South America. GI-11 is an exclusive South American lineage while the GI-16 lineage is distributed in Asia, Europe and South America. Here, we obtained the whole genome of two Uruguayan strains of the GI-11 and GI-16 lineages using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The strains here sequenced are the first obtained in South America for the infectious bronchitis virus and provide new insights into the origin, spreading and evolution of viral variants. The complete genome of the GI-11 and GI-16 strains have 27,621 and 27,638 nucleotides, respectively, and possess the same genomic organization. Phylogenetic incongruence analysis reveals that both strains have a mosaic genome that arose by recombination between Euro Asiatic strains of the GI-16 lineage and ancestral South American GI-11 viruses. The recombination occurred in South America and produced two viral variants that have retained the fulllength S1 sequences of the parental lineages but are extremely similar in the rest of their genomes. These recombinant virus have been extraordinary successful, persisting in the continent for several years with a notorious wide geographic distribution. Our findings reveal a singular viral dynamics and emphasize the importance of complete genomic characterization to understand the emergence and evolutionary history of viral variants.
40c0532640a8bb9d9a0aac07d017d5982af33fdb	Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is classified into two biotypes based on its pathogenicity in cats: a feline enteric coronavirus of low pathogenicity and a highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus. It has been suspected that FCoV alters its biotype via mutations in the viral genome. The S and 3c genes of FCoV have been considered the candidates for viral pathogenicity conversion. In the present study, FCoVs were analyzed for the frequency and location of mutations in the S and 3c genes from faecal samples of cats in an animal shelter and the faeces, effusions, and tissues of cats that were referred to veterinary hospitals. Our results indicated that approximately 95% FCoVs in faeces did not carry mutations in the two genes. However, 80% FCoVs in effusion samples exhibited mutations in the S and 3c genes with remainder displaying a mutation in the S or 3c gene. It was also suggested that mutational analysis of the 3c gene could be useful for studying the horizontal transmission of FCoVs in multi-cat environments. The genome of feline coronavirus (FCoV), a member of the Alphacoronavirus 1 species of the genus Alphacoronavirus, comprises single-stranded positive-sense RNA [9] . FCoV infection is prevalent in cats worldwide and is divided into two biotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The former has low pathogenicity, causing mild enteritis or unapparent infection, and the latter is highly virulent and lethal. FIP is characterised by the accumulation of body cavity effusions (effusive or wet form) and the formation of granulomatous lesions affecting multiple organs (non-effusive or dry form) [10] . FIPVs are considered mutants of FECVs [11, 12, 14] . Although the viral genes responsible for biotype conversion have not been completely elucidated, the candidate genes have been identified. The S gene encodes spike protein on the viral membrane. It was reported that 95.8% of 118 serotype I FIPVs displayed missense mutations in codon 1,058 or 1,060 of the S gene, whereas none of the sample of 183 FECVs exhibited these mutations [6] . The non-synonymous mutations in codons 1,058 and 1,060 substituted methionine to leucine (M1,058L) and serine to alanine (S1,060A), respectively. The 3c gene encoding an accessory viral protein was also reported to be mutated in 60-100% of FIPVs, resulting in the loss or truncation of the 3c protein, whereas most FECVs carried an intact 3c gene [3-5, 8, 11, 13, 14]. Accordingly, it was considered that mutation of the S gene, 3c gene or both was involved in the acquisition or augmentation of lethal pathogenicity in the majorityof FIPV field strains. In the present study, we analyzed the S and 3c genes of FCoVs detected in faecal materials, effusion samples, and tissues that were obtained from cats in Japan to determine the frequency and location of the mutations. An analysis of the 3c gene suggested the horizontal infection of FCoVs, which were detected in effusions and tissues, among several housemate cats in a multi-cat environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical specimens were obtained from 93 cats referred to private veterinary hospitals in Japan for suspected FIP based on clinical symptoms, including pyrexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice, emaciation, anaemia, ascites, pleural effusion, ophthalmologic abnormalities, neurological signs, and death. Some animals displayed an enlargement of abdominal organs that was noticed on palpation, radiography, or ultrasound. The samples of abdominal and pleural effusions, whole blood, serum, rectal swabs, faeces and tissues were sent to our laboratory under refrigeration. Tissues were obtained via autopsy of four cats that had been kept by the
897a842329739fa67d8518fe9a22c316e489f84d	This report summarizes the requirements and proposes a high-level solution for interoperability across recently proposed COVID-19 exposure notification efforts. Our focus is on interoperability across exposure notification (EN) applications which are based on the decentralized Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol driven by Google/Apple Exposure Notifications API (including DP3T and similar protocols). We distinguish different interoperability use cases, such as worldwide public EN interoperability, as well as interoperability in the enterprise EN systems. This report also proposes an API and a backend implementation architecture for EN interoperability. Finally, we propose using a permissioned blockchain-based solution for managing EN backend certificates and configurations (without storing any users' data on the blockchain) for helping address EN interoperability challenges across different vendors. • In Section 2, we give background overview of the GAEN BLE protocol, and motivate the need for interoperability of EN solutions. • Section 3 gives an overview of requirements for EN interoperability, refining the DP3T [7] and EU exposure notification interoperability guidelines [5] . • In Section 4, we propose a high-level solution for interoperability, distinguishing the cases of worldwide interoperability in the global, public EN use case, as well as interoperability in the enterprise EN use case. • Finally, Section 5 gives specific APIs for interoperability and outlines the EN interoperability implementation architecture. 1
64629d276b9e293a77780111157c93a8686bb078	Preceding or concurrent viral respiratory tract infection can predispose to secondary bacterial co-infection throughout the airway. The mechanisms by which viruses promote these superinfections are diverse and replete. Whereas we understand much as to how viruses damage the airway and dysregulate both innate and acquired immune responses which, in turn, supports bacterial growth, adherence and invasion into normally sterile sites within the respiratory tract, new information regarding these co-infections is being gained from recent advances in microbiome research and our enhanced appreciation of the contribution of bacterial biofilms, among others. The advanced understanding obtained by continued research efforts in all aspects of viral-bacterial coinfections of the respiratory tract will allow us to devise novel approaches for disease prevention as well as to develop more effective therapeutics.
9b31503e92a11a0b084d77b5fa20e9d7355f96b4	Purpose In the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to maximize communication in the scientific and medical community. In the context of academic meetings and conferences, there is the growing need for a set of guidelines secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the growing environmental and economic challenges that large academic and medical conferences face. These Virtual Meetings Best Practices were established in response to the scant evidence and guidance on the topic. Methods These best practice guidelines were developed from a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and lay literature. MEDLINE and Embase databases were scoped for relevant, non-duplicate articles. For lay articles, Google searches were utilized. The recommendations that comprise this document are a compilation of nonexperimental descriptive studies (e.g. case studies) and expert committee reports, opinions and/or experience of respected authorities, and lay articles. Results We identified four phases of the meeting cycle: Pre-planning considerations, Planning, Accomplishing conference goals through execution, gauging Response and Engaging the target audience for future cycles (PrePARE). Akin to the Plan, Do, Study, Act Cycle of quality improvement interventions, this document is meant to drive meaningful initial and subsequent interventions in the meetings of the medical and academic community. This covers actions and preparation for registration, scheduling, speakers, attendees, event type, technology, monetization/marketing, dealing with disruptions, post-event deliverables, response and engagement strategies. Enhanced access to integrated, high-quality and efficient virtual meetings will establish a new norm as an effective alternative for innovative health research, education and information dissemination in orthopaedics and beyond. Conclusions Given the uncertainty of whether large in-person gatherings will be permitted, advisable or responsible later into the summer of 2020 and beyond, these guidelines will aid events being converted and scheduled as virtual-only meetings. As we move forward in the era of increased utility and utilization of virtual conferencing, these guidelines will serve as a benchmark and standard for surgeons in the field.
9e602f46961cce9ac77ee54f6f478362153510b3	Background. Variant influenza A(H3N2) viruses (H3N2v) have transmitted recently from pigs to humans in the United States. Vaccines strategies are needed. Methods. Healthy adults received 2 doses of subvirion H3N2v vaccine (15 µg of hemagglutinin/dose) 21 days apart in this open-label trial. Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody (Ab) titers were measured before and 8 and 21 days after each dose. Memory B-cell (MBC) responses were assessed. Results. Vaccine was well tolerated. A total of 40% of subjects had an HAI Ab titer of ≥40 before vaccination. Eight-seven percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 79%-93%) and 73% (95% CI, 63%-81%) of subjects 18-64 years old (98 subjects) and ≥65 years old (90 subjects), respectively, had an HAI titer of ≥40 21 days after dose 1 (P = .01); 51% (95% CI, 41%-61%) and 52% (95% CI, 41%-62%) of younger and older subjects, respectively, developed ≥4fold rises in titer (P = not significant). Neut Ab response patterns were similar. Geometric mean titers were higher in younger subjects. Dose 2 provided no significant enhancement in responses. Cross-reactive MBCs were detected before vaccination and expanded after vaccination. Preexisting H3N2v-specific MBCs positively correlated with early increases in vaccine-induced Ab. Conclusions.

6e7ccee890e63857a43205195c605c7f164b90c4	Natural feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection has been shown to not only induce intestinal infection with viral shedding, but also systemic infection which either remains without clinical signs or leads to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). As systemic infection is not the key event in the development of FIP, the question arises as to whether a potential difference in viral load might be of importance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess feline coronavirus (FCoV) RNA loads in haemolymphatic tissues of healthy, long-term FCoV-infected cats and cats with FIP. In cats that died from FIP, viral loads were significantly higher, indicating a higher rate of viral replication or a reduced capacity for viral clearance in cats developing and/or suffering from FIP.
25fa8a17aa94357d8c2e401e3e5da992c53f6816	Obesity was associated with mortality and severity in patients with Dose-response meta-analysis demonstrate an increase of 5% risk for poor outcome for every 5 kg/mg 2 increase in body mass index. The relationship departed from linearity and became steeper from 30-35 kg/mg 2 onwards. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Abstract Background. -There is mounting evidence related to the association between obesity and severity of COVID-19. However, the direct relationship of the increase in the severe COVID-19 risk factors, with an increase in body mass index (BMI), has not yet been evaluated. Aim. -This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the dose-response relationship between body mass index (BMI) and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. Methods. -A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Europe PMC, ProQuest, and the Cochrane Central Database. The primary outcome was composite poor outcome composed of mortality and severity. The secondary outcomes were mortality and severity. Results. -A total of 34,390 patients from 12 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that obesity was associated with composite poor outcome (OR 1.73 [1.40, 2.14], P < 0.001; I 2 : 55.6%), mortality (OR 1.55 [1.16, 2.06], P = 0.003; I 2 : 74.4%), and severity (OR 1.90 [1.45, 2.48], P < 0.001; I 2 : 5.2%) in patients with COVID-19. A pooled analysis of highest BMI versus reference BMI indicate that a higher BMI in the patients was associated with composite poor outcome (aOR 3.02 [1.82, 5.00], P < 0.001; I 2 : 59.8%), mortality (aOR 2.85 [1.17, 6 .92], P = 0.002; I 2 : 79.7%), and severity (aOR 3.08 [1.78, 5.33], P < 0.001; I 2 : 11.7%). The dose-response meta-analysis showed an increased risk of composite poor outcome by aOR of 1.052 [1.028, 1.077], P < 0.001 for every 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI (P non-linearity < 0.001). The curve became steeper with increasing BMI. Conclusion. -Dose-response meta-analysis demonstrated that increased BMI was associated with increased poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.
4b3ab0475496277336ed686539bb05e7b65854d7	COVID-19 disease with a high rate of contagious and highly nonspecific symptoms, is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia and recover without any special cure. However, some others need special and emergency treatment to get rid of this widespread disease. Till now, there are numbers of proposed novel compounds as well as standards therapeutics agent existed for other conditions seems to have efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some which are being tested for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are validated that could be also efficient against this new coronavirus. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations introduced for 2019-nCoV specifically that be supported by highlevel evidence. The main purpose of this paper is to review typical and ongoing treatments for coronavirus disease including home remedies, herbal medicine, chemical drugs, plasma therapy, and also vaccinies. In this regards, famous herbal medicines and common chemical drugs which are routinely to be prescribed for patients are introduced. Moreover, a section is assigned to the drug interactions and some outdated drugs which have been proved to be inefficient. We hope that this work could pave the way for researchers to develop faster and more reliable methods for earlier treatment of patients and rescue more people.
0ddcfc9bedfb0a87a7221dd2448bd41d3ba9cc51	Acute viral infections pose many practical challenges for the accurate assessment of the impact of novel therapies on viral growth and decay. Using the example of influenza A, we illustrate how the measurement of infection-related quantities that determine the dynamics of viral load within the human host, can inform investigators on the course and severity of infection and the efficacy of a novel treatment. We estimated the values of key infectionrelated quantities that determine the course of natural infection from viral load data, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The data were placebo group viral load measurements collected during volunteer challenge studies, conducted by Roche, as part of the oseltamivir trials. We calculated the values of the quantities for each patient and the correlations between the quantities, symptom severity and body temperature. The greatest variation among individuals occurred in the viral load peak and area under the viral load curve. Total symptom severity correlated positively with the basic reproductive number. The most sensitive endpoint for therapeutic trials with the goal to cure patients is the duration of infection. We suggest laboratory experiments to obtain more precise estimates of virological quantities that can supplement clinical endpoint measurements.
53b037bc3483125f095c2ce8cde0040f57c55d64	Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only works in cities with higher GDP per capita and population size, while fails in cities with lower GDP per capita and population size. In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative; the rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in China at present, at the same time, we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures, cooperating and complementing each other; what's more, measures should be formulated according to the city's own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention; Finally, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide emotions of the public in a proper way, enhancing public confidence.
99da3adecbf75588f2b231f28a660d32a8ed5829	Since 2010, the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) has caused significant damage to the global pork industry. However, classical PEDV vaccine strains only provide limited protection against emerging strains. In this study, we successfully isolated and attenuated the PEDV epidemic strain Zhejiang08, which was characterized by good cell adaptation and high-titer production 48 h post infection in Vero E6 cells. The attenuated virus induced a high level of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies until 120 days after immunization in piglets and provided complete protection when challenged with an emerging virus strain on day 14 post immunization. Moreover, the capability to activate dendritic cells (DCs) of this isolate was identified. Higher expression levels of IL-12 and IFN-c were recorded in DCs after treatment with Zhejiang08 for 24 h. Furthermore, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed high homology between the main antigen epitopes of Zhejiang08 and PEDV pandemic isolates following 2011. Combining the glycosylation site prediction results and their distribution within the spatial structure of the S protein, led to the conclusion that the observed more effective host immune response of Zhejiang08 compared to CV777 was possibly associated with a lack of the potential glycosylation site in the 296 amino acids of the S protein. In summary, we illustrated that the attenuated virus represents a promising vaccine candidate.
dacb58b5ac7adedfeb44dde5632c503c5d37548f	The poxvirus life cycle, although physically autonomous from the host nucleus, is nevertheless dependent upon cellular functions. A requirement for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was implied by our previous demonstration that cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, impaired vaccinia virus production. Here we show that additional inhibitors of this pathway, TOFA and C75, reduce viral yield significantly, with partial rescue provided by exogenous palmitate, the pathway's endproduct. Palmitate's major role during infection is not for phospholipid synthesis or protein palmitoylation. Instead, the mitochondrial import and b-oxidation of palmitate are essential, as shown by the impact of etomoxir and trimetazidine, which target these two processes respectively. Moreover, the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose, which is otherwise dispensable for infection. In contrast to glucose, glutamine is essential for productive viral infection, providing intermediates that sustain the TCA cycle (anaplerosis). Cumulatively, these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial b-oxidation of palmitate which drives the TCA cycle and energy production. Additionally, infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate (ATP synthesis) that is ablated by etomoxir. The biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of TOFA, C75, or etomoxir, although the levels of viral DNA and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished. However, by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis, and then monitoring virus production after release of the block, we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to TOFA and C75. Electron microscopic analysis of cells released into C75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes. Taken together, these data indicate that vaccinia infection, and in particular virion assembly, relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids, where their b-oxidation drives robust ATP production.

63188fe828f332759eb902e48628239cb4679964	Strong international health agreements and good planning created a structure and common procedure for nations involved in detection and evaluation of the emergence of influenza A (H1N1). This report describes a timeline of events that led to the determination of the epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern, following the agreed-upon procedures of the International Health Regulations. These events illustrate the need for sound international health agreements and should be a call to action for all nations to implement these agreements to the best of their abilities.
768a2929940a3ef8070aed99f7ed4e5a37857f81	Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global crisis. There is no therapeutic treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and, thus, repurpose them for treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. Here we report a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution (RED) function designed to accelerate the FEP-ABFE calculations and make the practical FEP-ABFE-based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible for the first time. As a result, out of twenty-five drugs predicted, fifteen were confirmed as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M pro . The most potent one is dipyridamole (Ki=0.04 µM) which has showed promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki=0.36 µM) and chloroquine (Ki=0.56 µM) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M pro for the first time. We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.
878d2ac6c02578eb7166149d9f6a2b4e01a238b6	In the present study, we evaluated post-mortem lateral cerebral ventricle (LCV) changes using computed tomography (CT). Subsequent periodical CT scans termed Bsequential scans^were obtained for three cadavers. The first scan was performed immediately after the body was transferred from the emergency room to the institute of legal medicine. Sequential scans were obtained and evaluated for 24 h at maximum. The time of death had been determined in the emergency room. The sequential scans enabled us to observe periodical post-mortem changes in CT images. The series of continuous LCV images obtained up to 24 h (two cases)/16 h (1 case) after death was evaluated. The average Hounsfield units (HU) within the LCVs progressively increased, and LCV volume progressively decreased over time. The HU in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased at an individual rate proportional to the post-mortem interval (PMI). Thus, an early longitudinal radiodensity change in the CSF could be potential indicator of post-mortem interval (PMI). Sequential imaging scans reveal post-mortem changes in the CSF space which may reflect post-mortem brain alterations. Further studies are needed to evaluate the proposed CSF change markers in correlation with other validated PMI indicators.
deec036df7cfcac7c2b29ccb8fbfd3dfd00b4af2	Radiology departments have been directly involved from the beginning of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emergency to provide imaging lung assessment of suspected and positive patients while ensuring the execution of other routine and emergency examinations for non-COVID-19 patients. To limit the risk of the infection spread, radiology departments should be reconfigured. We propose the example of the reorganization of the Radiology Department of our hospital, in the center of Milan, in Northern Italy, which consisted of the creation of 2 completely distinct pathways and distinct radiological machines for COVID-19 positive or suspected positive and for non-COVID-19 patients.

5669014577f6b036be063d19be1f9749ae1223dc	Recent years have witnessed the emergence of novel models for ad-hoc entity search in knowledge graphs of varying complexity. Since these models are based on direct term matching, their accuracy can suffer from a mismatch between vocabularies used in queries and entity descriptions. Although successful applications of word embeddings and knowledge graph entity embeddings to address the issues of vocabulary mismatch in ad-hoc document retrieval and knowledge graph noisiness and incompleteness, respectively, have been reported in recent literature, the utility of joint word and entity embeddings for entity search in knowledge graphs has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose Knowledge graph Entity and Word Embedding for Retrieval (KEWER), a novel method to embed entities and words into the same low-dimensional vector space, which takes into account a knowledge graph's local structure and structural components, such as entities, attributes, and categories, and is designed specifically for entity search. KEWER is based on random walks over the knowledge graph and can be considered as a hybrid of word and network embedding methods. Similar to word embedding methods, KEWER utilizes contextual co-occurrences as training data, however, it treats words and entities as different objects. Similar to network embedding methods, KEWER takes into account knowledge graph's local structure, however, it also differentiates between structural components. Experiments on publicly available entity search benchmarks and state-ofthe-art word and joint word and entity embedding methods indicate that a combination of KEWER and BM25F results in a consistent improvement in retrieval accuracy over BM25F alone.
0dc475f4419836c2dc352073498f56ae982170a0	The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA-RP) is an FDA certified multiplex PCR that can detect 17 viruses and 3 bacteria responsible for upper respiratory tract infections, thus it is potentially useful to the assessment of the age-related prevalence of these pathogens. In this observational study, we retrospectively analyzed the results of all the respiratory samples, which had been processed during 1 year-period (November 2015 to November 2016) with the FA-RP, in the Central Laboratories of Hygeia & Mitera General Hospitals of Athens, Greece. In order to have an age-related distribution, the following age groups were implemented: (<2), (≥2, <5), (≥5, <10), (≥10, <18), (≥18, <45), (≥45, <65), and (≥65) years old. Among 656 respiratory samples tested, 362 (55%) were from male and 294 (45%) from female patients, while 356 (54.3%) were positive and 300 (45.7%) negative. In the first age-group (<2), 41/121 samples (33.9%) revealed human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV) and 16 (13.2%) adenovirus (Adv), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus (Hmpv), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV). In the age-group (≥2, <5), Adv predominated with 37/147 samples (25.2%), followed by HRV, RSV, coronavirus (all types), and influenza, Hmpv and PIV. In the age-group (≥5, <10), HRV was identified in 25/80 samples (31.3%), Adv in 18 (22.5%), influenza in 11 (13.8%), and Hmpv in 6 (7.5%). Influenza predominated in the age-group (≥10, <18), with 4/22 samples (18.2%), while in the remaining age-groups (≥18), HRV was the commonest isolated pathogen, 33/286 (11.5%), followed by influenza with 20 (7%) (influenza A H1-2009, 11/20). In our patient series, HRV seemed to prevail in most age-groups, followed by Adv, although Influenza was the second most frequent pathogen isolated in the age-groups (≥18). Moreover, increasing age corresponded to increasing possibility of having a negative sample, indicating that FilmArray may be more useful before adolescence. Abbreviations: Adv = adenovirus, FA-RP = FilmArray Respiratory Panel, HCoV = coronaviruses, Hmpv = human metapneumovirus, HRSV, RSV = (human) respiratory syncytial virus, HRV = human rhinovirus/enterovirus, PIV = parainfluenza virus, Rs = respiratory samples, URIs = upper respiratory tract infections.
57bd23b3e3470ad1a6389bb584b5e16f1d907dfd	The genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus encodes for eight accessory viral proteins with no known homologues in other coronaviruses. One of these is the 3b protein, which is encoded by the second open reading frame in subgenomic RNA 3 and contains 154 amino acids. Here, a detailed time-course study was performed to compare the apoptosis and necrosis profiles induced by full-length 3b, a 3b mutant that was deleted by 30 amino acids from the C terminus (3b 124-154) and the classical apoptosis inducer, Bax. Our results showed that Vero E6 cells transfected with a construct for expressing 3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time-points. At all the time-points analysed, the apoptosis induced by the expression of 3b was less than the level induced by Bax but the level of necrosis was comparable. The 3b 124-154 mutant behaves in a similar manner indicating that the localization of the 3b protein does not seems to be important for the cell-death pathways since full-length 3b is localized predominantly to the nucleolus, while the mutant is found to be concentrated in the peri-nuclear regions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the induction of necrosis by a SARS-CoV protein.
2a423f15be9162d939e0402df6f74c31ee2e9486	Viruses are among the most common causes of opportunistic infection after transplantation. The risk for viral infection is a function of the specific virus encountered, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection, and other host factors governing susceptibility. Although cytomegalovirus is the most common opportunistic pathogen seen in transplant recipients, numerous other viruses have also affected outcomes. In some cases, preventive measures such as pretransplant screening, prophylactic antiviral therapy, or posttransplant viral monitoring may limit the impact of these infections. Recent advances in laboratory monitoring and antiviral therapy have improved outcomes. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections. This paper will summarize the major viral infections seen following transplant and discuss strategies for prevention and management of these potential pathogens.
3bbcca7765b9043c0e0452571b217be209ad3745	The objective of this paper is to perform a meta-analysis regarding the chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia patients. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from 1 December 2019 to 1 May 2020 using the keywords of "COVID-19 virus," "the 2019 novel coronavirus," "novel coronavirus," and "COVID-19." Studies that evaluated the CT manifestations of common and severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included. Among the 9736 searched results, 15 articles describing 1453 common patients and 697 severe patients met the inclusion criteria. Based on the CT images, the common patients were less frequent to exhibit consolidation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.31), pleural effusion (OR = 0.19), lymphadenopathy (OR = 0.17), crazy-paving pattern (OR = 0.22), interlobular septal thickening (OR = 0.27), reticulation (OR = 0.20), traction bronchiectasis (OR = 0.40) with over two lobes involved (OR = 0.07) and central distribution (OR = 0.18) while more frequent to bear unilateral pneumonia (OR = 4.65) involving one lobe (OR = 13.84) or two lobes (OR = 6.95) when compared with severe patients. Other CT features including ground-glass opacities (P = .404), air bronchogram (P = .070), nodule (P = .093), bronchial wall thickening (P = .15), subpleural band (P = .983), vascular enlargement (P = .207), and peripheral distribution (P = .668) did not have a significant association with the severity of the disease. No publication bias among the selected studies was suggested (Harbord's tests, P > .05 for all.) We obtained reliable estimates of the chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia patients, which might provide an important clue for the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 pneumonia.

c856a5583dad88feeb274cf1ba74ce99632d3d6c	Background: Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease caused by PED virus (PEDV), characterized by vomitting, watery diarrhea and fatal dehydration with high mortality in sucking piglets of one week of age. Although PEDV induced cell apoptosis has been established in vitro and in vivo, the functional protein that contributes to this event remains unclear. Methods: The activation or cleavage of main apoptosis-associated molecular such as AIFM1, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and PARP in PEDV infected host cells were analyzed by western blotting. The nuclear change of infected cell was monitored by confocal immunofluorescence assay. The overexpressing plasmids of 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) and 6 structural proteins (M, N, E, ORF3, S1 and S2) were constructed by cloning. Cell apoptosis induced by PEDV or overexpression non-structural or structural proteins was measured by the flow cytometry assay. Results: PEDV could infect various host cells including Vero, Vero-E6 and Marc-145 and cause obvious cytopathic effects, including roundup, cell fusion, cell membrane vacuolation, syncytium formation and cause apparent apoptosis. In infected cells, PEDV-induced apoptosis is accompanied by nuclear concentration and fragmentation as a result of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and AIFM1 and PARP cleavage. Overexpression of S1 Spike protein of PEDV SM98 strain effectively induced host cell apoptosis, while the expression of the other non-structure proteins (Nsp1-16) and structural proteins (M, N, E, S2 and ORF3) has no or less effect on cell apoptosis. Similarly, expression of S1 protein from wild-type strain BJ2011 or cell-adapted strain CV777, also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the S1 proteins from various coronavirus family members such as TGEV, IBV, CCoV, SARS and MERS could also induce Vero-E6 cells apoptosis. Conclusion: S1 Spike protein is one of the most critical functional proteins that contribute to cell apoptosis. Expression of S1 proteins of the coronavirus tested in this study could all induce cell apoptosis suggesting S1 maybe is an effective inducer in Coronavirus-induced cell apoptosis and targeting S1 protein expression probably is a promising strategy to inhibit coronavirus infection and thus mediated apoptosis on host cells.

Use is made of the vector autoregressive asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (VAR-ADCC-GARCH) model to this end. Moreover, the paper assesses the magnitude of the optimal portfolio weight, hedge ratio and hedge effectiveness for portfolios constituted of a pair of assets, namely oil-stock and gold-stock pairs. The findings of the study show that there is significant volatility spillover between the gold and stock markets, and the oil and stock markets. This finding suggests the importance of the link between the commodity and stock markets, which is essential for portfolio management. With reference to portfolio optimization and the possibility of hedging when using the pairs of assets under study, the findings suggest the importance of combining gold and stocks as the best strategy to hedge against stocks risk, especially during financial crises.
9b98c06cf3e63c73fe0334f62b6e1d2d2909dcaa	Background: Specialist paediatric palliative care services are promoted as an important component of palliative care provision, but there is uncertainty about their role for children with cancer. Aim: To examine the impact of specialist paediatric palliative care for children and young people with cancer and explore factors affecting access. Design: A mixed-methods systematic review and narrative synthesis (PROSPERO Registration No. CRD42017064874). Data sources: Database (CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO) searches (2000-2019) identified primary studies of any design exploring the impact of and/or factors affecting access to specialist paediatric palliative care. Study quality was assessed using The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: An evidence base of mainly low-and moderate-quality studies (n = 42) shows that accessing specialist paediatric palliative care is associated with less intensive care at the end of life, more advance care planning and fewer in-hospital deaths. Current evidence cannot tell us whether these services improve children's symptom burden or quality of life. Nine studies reporting provider or family views identified uncertainties about what specialist paediatric palliative care offers, concerns about involving a new team, association of palliative care with end of life and indecision about when to introduce palliative care as important barriers to access. There was evidence that children with haematological malignancies are less likely to access these services. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that children and young people with cancer receiving specialist palliative care are cared for differently. However, little is understood about children's views, and research is needed to determine whether specialist input improves quality of life.

c4bca69f6cb21bb4b0214724a0e96abfd8b9027a	The genome of Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV) contains 10 double stranded RNA segments (S1-S10). The segment 7 (S7) encodes 50 kDa protein which is considered as a structural protein. The expression pattern and function of p50 in the virus life cycle are still unclear. In this study, the viral structural protein 7 (VP7) polyclonal antibody was prepared with immunized mouse to explore the presence of small VP7 gene-encoded proteins in Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus. The expression pattern of vp7 gene was investigated by its overexpression in BmN cells. In addition to VP7, supplementary band was identified with western blotting technique. The virion, BmCPV infected cells and midguts were also examined using western blotting technique. 4, 2 and 5 bands were detected in the corresponding samples, respectively. The replication of BmCPV genome in the cultured cells and midgut of silkworm was decreased by reducing the expression level of vp7 gene using RNA interference. In immunoprecipitation experiments, using a polyclonal antiserum directed against the VP7, one additional shorter band in BmCPV infected midguts was detected, and then the band was analyzed with mass spectrum (MS), the MS results showed thatone candidate interacted protein (VP7 voltagedependent anion-selective channel-like isoform, VDAC) was identified from silkworm. We concluded that the novel viral product was generated with a leaky scanning mechanism and the VDAC may be an interacted protein with VP7.
b6ff296bae49fc2b26175374f9fab15efd94a3f8	We present the case of a six-year-old girl with severe COVID-19, in whom SARS-CoV-2 was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 successfully eliminated after convalescent plasma transfusion. Children show a variable clinical course of COVID-19, from asymptomatic to critical. In our patient, we diagnosed COVID-19-associated aplastic anemia with severe pancytopenia. The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection with aplastic anemia remains unclear. At the beginning of the disease, we used antiviral drugs and immune modulators as therapy but without any positive results. After providing a transfusion of convalescent plasma, the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 was observed. We did not observe any adverse events of this treatment. The girl still has a diagnosis of aplastic anemia and requires specialist therapy.
a25045aa52c78b89840287b2cff9d7dffe0bb07f	The proteomes that make up the collection of proteins in contemporary organisms evolved through recombination and duplication of a limited set of domains. These protein domains are essentially the main components of globular proteins and are the most principal level at which protein function and protein interactions can be understood. An important aspect of domain evolution is their atomic structure and biochemical function, which are both specified by the information in the amino acid sequence. Changes in this information may bring about new folds, functions and protein architectures. With the present and still increasing wealth of sequences and annotation data brought about by genomics, new evolutionary relationships are constantly being revealed, unknown structures modeled and phylogenies inferred. Such investigations not only help predict the function of newly discovered proteins, but also assist in mapping unforeseen pathways of evolution and reveal crucial, co-evolving inter-and intra-molecular interactions. In turn this will help us describe how protein domains shaped cellular interaction networks and the dynamics with which they are regulated in the cell. Additionally, these studies can be used for the design of new and optimized protein domains for therapy. In this review, we aim to describe the basic concepts of protein domain evolution and illustrate recent developments in molecular evolution that have provided valuable new insights in the field of comparative genomics and protein interaction networks. has its own rate, while their combined effect gives a certain probability for the change of one defined amino acid (or nucleotide) to another within a specific time interval.

Thus, proteins involved in the initiation of cap-dependent translation have emerged as potential anti-cancer drug targets. Cap-dependent translation is initiated by the binding of the factor eIF4E to the cap domain of mRNA. Detailed x-ray crystal and NMR structures are available for eIF4E in association with cap-analogs, as well as domains of other initiation factors. This review will summarize efforts to design potential antagonist of eIF4E that could be used as new pharmacological tools and anti-cancer agents and. Insights drawn from these studies should aid in the design of future inhibitors of eIF4E dependent translation initiation.
41baf86e820a5e739060387ff65579621a4859cd	The WHO declared the novel coronavirus disease a pandemic, with severe consequences for health and global economic activity and Italy is one of the hardest hit countries. This study aims to assess the socio-economic burden of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy through the estimation of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and productivity loss. The observational study was based on data from official governmental sources collected since the inception of epidemic until 28 April 2020. DALYs for a disease combines the years of life lost due to premature mortality in the population and the years lost due to disability of the disease. In addition to DALYs, temporary productivity loss due to absenteeism from work and permanent productivity loss due to premature mortality were estimated using the Human Capital Approach. The total DALYs amount to 2.01 per 1000 persons. The total permanent productivity loss was around EUR 300 million while the temporary productivity loss was around EUR 100 million. This evaluation does not consider other economic aspects related to lockdown, quarantine of contacts, healthcare direct costs etc. The burden of disease methodology is functional metric for steering choices of health policy and allowing the government to be accountable for the utilization of resources.

c40cdc3e85b722dcc0f509f36e016b1134825f20	The association of early onset wheezing with common viral and bacterial infections has raised significant interest in the role of infections in childhood asthma inception. This article serves to review these relationships among infections, host factors, and asthma inception in childhood.
4bc77a5504262d2f8461781edd4a8f96ced83535	Financial interval time series (ITS) is a time series whose value at each time step is an interval composed by the low and the high price of an asset. The low-high price range is related to the concept of volatility because it inherits intraday price variability. Accurate forecasting of price ranges is essential for derivative pricing, trading strategies, risk management, and portfolio allocation. This paper suggests a fuzzy rule-based approach to model and to forecast interval-valued time series. The model is a collection of functional fuzzy rules with affine consequents capable to express the nonlinear relationships encountered in interval-valued data. An application concerning one-step-ahead forecast of interval-valued EUR/USD exchange rate using actual data is also addressed. The forecast performance of the fuzzy rule-based model is compared to that of traditional econometric time series methods and alternative interval models employing statistical criteria for both, low and high exchange rate prices. The results show that fuzzy rule-based modeling approach developed in this paper outperforms the random walk, and other competitive approaches in out-of-sample interval-valued exchange rate forecasting.
1b27e750058986d5e357b441c23917da906b5549	Ride-sourcing has recently been at the centre of attention as the most disruptive mode of transport associated with the so-called shared mobility era. Drivers, riders, the platform, policymakers, and the general public are considered as the main stakeholders of the system. While ride-sourcing platforms have been growing, so did the heightened tension between them and their drivers. That is why understanding drivers' behaviour and preferences is of key importance to ride-sourcing companies in managing their relationship with drivers (also known as driver-partners) and in retaining them in the presence of competence. Ride-sourcing drivers are not only chauffeurs but fleet owners. They can make various operational and tactical decisions that directly influence other stakeholders and the transport system performance as a whole. Conducting a series of focus groups with ride-sourcing drivers in the Netherlands, we have studied their opinions about the system functionalities as well as their possible interactions with the platform and wishes for changes. The focus group results suggest that the main decisions of drivers, which are ride acceptance, relocation strategies, working shift and area in which to work, could be affected by many elements depending on platform strategies, drivers' characteristics, riders' attributes, and exogenous factors. We find that part-time and full-time drivers, as well as experienced and beginning drivers, are characterized by distinctive behaviour. Flexibility and freedom were mentioned as the key reasons for joining the platform while an unfair reputation system, unreliable navigation algorithm, high competition between drivers, passenger-oriented platform, high-commission fee, and misleading guidance were acknowledged as being the main system drawbacks. Based on our findings, we propose a conceptual model that frames the relationship between the tactical and operational decisions of drivers and related factors.
862f31aee78fcce800a91e996ed5048968726656	Aims. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common comorbidities in Coronavirus disease 2019 patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influences of diabetes mellitus on the severity and fatality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Medical records of 66 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were collected and classified into non-severe (mild/moderate cases) and severe (severe/critical cases) groups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19 (severe/critical infection). In addition, a meta-analysis including published studies reported the impacts of diabetes mellitus on severity and fatality of COVID-19, and our current study was conducted using fixed-effects models. Results. There were 22 diabetic and 44 non-diabetic cases among the 66 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As the results shown, seven cases (31.82%) were diagnosed as severe COVID-19 in diabetic patients, which was significantly higher than that in non-diabetic group (4/44, 9.09%, P=0.033). After adjustment for age and gender, the results showed that diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (OR: 5.29, 95% CI: 1.07-26.02). A meta-analysis further confirmed the positive association between diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 severity (pooled OR = 2.58, 95 % CI: 1.93-3.45). Moreover, the diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed to have 2.95-fold higher risk of fatality compared to those patients without diabetes mellitus (95 % CI: 1.93-4.53).

Objectives Critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 are associated with a high risk of mortality. It remains unclear why patients with the same critical condition have different outcomes. We aimed to explore relevant factors that may affect the prognosis of This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. critical COVID-19 patients. Methods Six critical COVID-19 inpatients were included in our study. The 6 patients were divided into two groups based on whether they had a good or poor prognosis. We collected peripheral blood samples at admission and the time point of exacerbation to compare differences in the phenotypes and functions of major populations of immune cells between the groups. Results On admission, compared to patients with poor prognoses, those with good prognoses had significantly higher counts of monocytes (p < 0.05), macrophages (p < 0.05), higher frequency of CD3 + CD4 + CD45RO + CXCR3 + subsets (p < 0.05), higher frequency of CD14 + CD11C + HLA-DR + subset of dendritic cells (DCs) (p < 0.05), and a lower count of neutrophils (p < 0.05). At the time point of exacerbation, the proportions of naïve CD4 + T cells (p < 0.05), Tregs, and Th2 cells in the poor prognosis group were relatively higher than those in the good prognosis group, and CD4 + memory T cells were relatively lower (p < 0.05). Conclusion According to our results, the poor prognosis group showed a worse immune response than the good prognosis group at the time of admission and at exacerbation. Dysregulation of the immune response affects the outcome of critical COVID-19 patients.
2bc3cdd87d1f68b7672f5b4033de824363c28604	Available vaccines fail to induce lasting and protective immunity to equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) associated diseases. RNA interference is a novel approach showing promise for therapeutic use in outbreak situations. This study examined the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on clinical signs as well as the presence of live virus and viral DNA in nasal secretions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in horses experimentally infected with EHV-1. siRNA targeting two EHV-1 genes (glycoprotein B and the origin binding protein) was administered 12 h before and 12 h after intranasal infection with EHV-1. Control horses received siRNA targeting firefly luciferase. A significantly smaller proportion (0/10) of horses receiving siRNA targeting viral genes required euthanasia due to intractable neurologic disease as compared to horses in the control group (3/4; p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the presence of live virus or viral DNA in the nasal secretions or PBMCs between the two groups. Future studies are necessary to define the relative contributions of host and virus factors in the development of the neurological form of the infection and to determine an optimal dosing regimen for metaphylactic or therapeutic use of siRNA for treating EHV-1 infection.
410e6ed33957e3d51b0f0066ff86a44284bfd501	Together with influenza, the non-influenza RNA respiratory viruses (NIRVs), which include respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus, represent a considerable global health burden, as recognised by WHO's Battle against Respiratory Viruses initiative. By contrast with influenza viruses, little is known about the contemporaneous global diversity of these viruses, and the relevance of such for development of pharmaceutical interventions. Although far less advanced than for influenza, antiviral drugs and vaccines are in different stages of development for several of these viruses, but no interventions have been licensed. This scarcity of global genetic data represents a substantial knowledge gap and impediment to the eventual licensing of new antiviral drugs and vaccines for NIRVs. Enhanced genetic surveillance will assist and boost research and development into new antiviral drugs and vaccines for these viruses. Additionally, understanding the global diversity of respiratory viruses is also part of emerging disease preparedness, because non-human coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses have been listed as priority concerns in a recent WHO research and development blueprint initiative for emerging infectious diseases. In this Personal View, we explain further the rationale for expanding the genetic database of NIRVs and emphasise the need for greater investment in this area of research.
3af50b021800015594a4a895b7e0825eb1731ad2	Fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Enterococcus, have been widely used to indicate the presence of pathogens. However, the suitability of fecal indicator bacteria to represent health risks is still being challenged, particularly in tropical aquatic environments. The objective of this study is to understand the occurrence and prevalence of indicators and pathogens in areas with contrasting land use, as well as to identify the major correlations between indicators, pathogens and environmental parameters. The spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use, and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations. A total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries, and tested for fecal indicator bacteria, coliphages, human specific markers, pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low, while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees. Of the enteric viruses, norovirus GII was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration. Although strong correlations were found between indicators, only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens. The results in this study showed that none of the bacteria/phage indicators were universal predictors for pathogens. Inclusion of the alternative indicators, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Bacteroides and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) to monitoring programs could help to determine whether the fecal source was human. The microbial distribution patterns allow the classification of sampling sites to different clusters and thus, help to identify sites which have poor water quality. This approach will be useful for water quality management to pinpoint factors that influence water quality and help to prioritize sites for restoration of water quality.
2c2614f0dca663605036cdd2bbac3112cf0ac94f	Addictovigilance is a safety monitoring targeted at substances with potential for abuse and dependence. This vigilance was involved during the period of COVID-19 epidemic due to the significant changes in access to drugs and psychological disruption caused by the pandemic and lockdown. This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role : among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19 ). COVID-19 epidemic has been an important challenge for addictovigilance, and has proved that this monitoring is highly essential for alerting health professionals and health authorities to points of vigilance in the field of psychoactive substances.

681abe795769a807b043603ae723815aa57b00eb	1 Bats are responsible for the zoonotic transmission of several major viral diseases including the 2 2003 SARS outbreak and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While bat genomic sequencing 3 studies have revealed characteristic adaptations of the innate immune system, functional genomic 4 studies are urgently needed to provide a foundation for the molecular dissection of the tolerance 5 of viral infections in bats. Here we report the establishment and screening of genome-wide RNAi 6 library and CRISPR library for the model megabat, Pteropus Alecto. We used the complementary 7 RNAi and CRISPR libraries to interrogate Pteropus Alecto cells for infection with two different 8 viruses, mumps virus and Influenza A virus, respectively. Screening results converged on the 9 endocytosis pathway and the protein secretory pathway as required for both viral infections. 10 Additionally, we revealed a general dependence of the C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene, 11 MTHFD1, for viral replication in bat cells as well as in human cells. MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton 12 potently blocked replication of several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies provide 13 a resource for systematic inquiry into the genetic underpinnings of bat biology and a potential 14 target for developing broad spectrum antiviral therapy. 15 16 17 As the only mammal capable of sustained flying, bats are intriguing animals with unique 18 behavioral and physiological characteristics. Bats are notorious for transmission of deadly 19 viruses, causing the epidemics of the Ebola 1 , SARS 2 , Henipavirus 3 , MERS 4 and 6 . 20 Bats are widely considered the largest reservoir of numerous virus species but are resilient to the 21 diseases associated with many of these viruses 7,8 . How bats tolerate the infections with these 22 viruses is of intense interest due to the scientific and public health relevance. Genomic 23 sequencing studies have revealed several genetic adaptions underlying this tolerance of viral 24 infections. For example, the DNA damage checkpoint pathway and the NF-kB pathway are 25 known to be positively selected in the bat genomes 9 . In addition, in the type I interferon gene 26 family, the MHC class I genes and natural killer cell receptor family have been reported to be 27 highly expanded in the bat genomes 10 . These studies provided evidence to support the hypothesis 28 that bats have evolved a highly specific genetic configuration, especially in the innate immunity 29 pathways. A major caveat is the lack of systematic examination of the functions of these genes 30 due to shortage of functional genomic tools. 31 3 CRISPR and RNAi technologies have enabled genome-wide screening of gene functions for a 1 variety of cell types, yielding an unprecedented wealth of information revealing the complexity of 2 biological processes 11,12 . This is especially true in the field of virus-host interactions, where a 3 plethora of host factors have been identified for a variety of viruses [13][14] [15] . Both technologies have 4 advantages and disadvantages and provide complementary approaches to achieve comprehensive 5 genetic perturbations [16][17][18] . CRISPR permits complete knockout of a gene, thus affords generation 6 of truly null genotype. A caveat is that the lethality associated with knockout of essential genes 7 prevents functional parsing of these genes in different biological processes. In addition, CRISPR 8 screening is usually used a pool-based format that requires the generation of stable cell lines 9 through long term culturing. Therefore, CRISPR is suited for studying phenotypes that require a 10 longer time to manifest. Based on previous studies, CRISPR screens demonstrated excellent 11 specificity but limited sensitivity 17 . In contrast, siRNA screening relies on temporary knockdown 12 of genes in an individual well format, a methodology suited for examining short-term phenotypic 13 changes. Due to the transient nature of the assay, siRNA screening can tolerate growth defects due 14 to gene knockdown and can elucidate hypomorphic phenotypes induced by siRNAs with varying 15 degrees of knockdown. In general, RNAi screens allow comprehensive identification of genes in 16 a biological process at the cost of more false positives due to pervasive off-target effects 17 . To fully 17 realize the power of CRISPR and RNAi screening as complementary strategies to interrogate gene 18 function in bats, here we developed a pool-based CRISPR library and a plate-based siRNA library 19 for the whole genome of the model megabat Pteropus Alecto. We screened two viruses, influenza 20 A virus and mumps virus, using the CRISPR and RNAi libraries, respectively, in the hope of 21 uncovering common host factors for different viruses. From these two screens, common pathways 22 such as the endocytosis pathway and protein secretory pathway have been identified, 23 demonstrating conserved pathways between bat and other mammals in hosting viral infections. 24 We extensively characterized a common hit from the two screens, MTHFD1, and identified it as a 25 critical factor for viral replication in both bats and humans. We further demonstrate that MTHFD1 26 is a potential target for developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton 27 demonstrated broad antiviral activities against Zika virus, mumps virus, and importantly, SARS-28 CoV-2. In summary, we developed two orthogonal libraries for genome-wide loss-of-function 29 screening in bats and demonstrated their utility in discovery of important host factors for viral 30 infections. 31 4 We designed and synthesized the CRISPR and RNAi libraries based on the genome of P. alecto. 2 For the CRISPR library, we adopted the algorithm developed for the construction of the popular 3 GeCKO library to select single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) 19 . We designed 85,275 sgRNAs targeting 4 21,334 genes annotated in the P. alecto genome with 21,330 genes with 4 sgRNAs for each gene. 5 The other 34 genes have 1-3 sgRNAs due to the constraints of the gene sequences for designing 6 sgRNAs. Selection of sgRNAs was based on the calculations of off-target scores to lower potential 7 off-target effects of the sgRNAs. The sgRNAs designs were validated for 21 sgRNAs targeting 11 8 genes using T7E1 endonuclease cleavage assay or Western blotting. We observed 90.5% of 9 effectiveness in gene editing or gene knockdown, supporting the quality of the designed library 10 (Supplementary Figure 1) . 11 12 We performed a CRISPR screen with influenza A virus in PaKi cells to identify viral host factors 14 (Fig. 1a) . PaKi cells stably expressing SgCas9 and sgRNA library were infected with the H1N1 15 PR8 strain of influenza A virus, in duplicate. We used a high multiplicity-of-infection (MOI) so 16 that naïve PaKi cells all died before the 9th day post infection. We then collected the surviving 17 cells and compared sgRNA abundance with mock-infected cells. The two replicates demonstrated 18 a high correlation, indicating high reproducibility (Supplementary Fig. 2) . We calculated the 19 results using the RIGER algorithm and identified 21 host factors required for the viral infection or 20 pathogenesis 20 (Fig. 1b) . Three of the top four hits belong to the V-type proton ATPase subunits 21 (ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1F and ATP6V0D1), which are involved in the acidification of endosome 22 and have previously been previous identified as key host factors for influenza virus entry in several 23 screens performed in human cells (Fig. 1b) 21 . Among the other hits were two genes, COPZ1 and 24 SEC23B, involved in the protein secretory pathway, which are also known to be required for the 25 replication of many viruses including influenza virus and flavivirus (Fig. 1b) 21-23 . The enrichment 26 of previously known host factors in the identified hits in the CRISPR screen validated our library 27 and the screening methodology. 28 29 RNAi screen results converge with CRISPR screening on key pathways 30 5 We synthesized the sgRNA library in an array-based oligonucleotide library and cloned them into 1 the lentiGuide-Puro lentivirus expression vector 24 . A custom bat siRNA library was designed to 2 target 18,328 genes using 40,016 siRNA duplexes. We performed RNAi screening in PaKi cells 3 for identification of host factors for the infection of mumps virus, a paramyxovirus (Fig. 1c) . The 4 screen was performed in 384-well format with a mumps virus strain expressing EGFP from an 5 additional open reading frame 25 . PaKi cells were infected 48 hours after transfection of the siRNA 6 library. High-content imaging analysis was utilized to quantitate the infection rate as well as the 7 total cell number each well, indicating cytotoxicity of the siRNA. Excluding siRNAs with 8 significant cytotoxicity, we selected 45 host dependency factors whose knockdown resulted in 9 significantly reduced viral infection and 45 host restriction factors whose knockdown promoted 10 viral infection based on the Z score of infection rate (Fig. 1d) . We selected a number of genes for 11 individual validation with more replicates and obtained a high validation rate (11/12 of host 12 dependency factors and 7/12 of the host restriction factors validated with at least one siRNA) 13 ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , supporting the reproducibility of our screening methodology. 14 15 Although there is only one gene overlap between the host factors identified in both CRISPR 16 and RNAi screens, we observed that the endocytosis pathway and protein secretory pathway were 17 enriched in both screens, albeit represented by different genes (Fig. 1b and 1d) . For the 18 endocytosis pathway, two genes encoding components of clathrin complex, CLTA and CLTC, 19 were among the top three hits (Fig. 1d) . Four genes involved in the protein secretory, namely 20 ARF1, ARF4, COPG1 and SEC61B, were identified (Fig. 1d) . This is consistent with the idea that 21 both influenza A virus and mumps require the two pathways for viral replication. In addition, 22 protein translation initiation, which was previously reported to be required for influenza A 23 infection 21 , was also represented in the top hits by three genes: EIF3B, EIF3G and EIF4A3. 24 the top hits were several known antiviral genes, TRIM39, TRIM43 26 and NAMPT 27 . Overall, we 26 identified many candidate genes that might play a role in viral infection in bats. 27 The two pathways identified by both CRISPR screen and siRNA screen, endocytosis and 29 protein secretion, have previously been implicated in human host response to a number of viral 30 pathogens 13,21,23 To validate the role of these pathways in the bat response to viral infection, we 31 6 established PaKi stable cell lines expressing shRNAs targeting several hits from the two screens. 1 Stable knockdown of a V-type proton ATPase subunit and SEC23B led to a significant decrease 2 of influenza A virus infection in PaKi cells ( Fig. 1e and 1f ). In addition, the small molecule 3 inhibitor of V-type proton ATPase, bafilomycin A (Fig. 1g) , potently blocked influenza infection. 4 Taken together, these results demonstrate that bat and human cells share key genes and pathways 5 in hosting viral infection. 6 7 MTHFD1 is a key host factor for a broad spectrum of RNA viruses 8 The gene identified as a host factor from both the CRISPR and RNAi screen was MTHFD1 (Fig.  9   1c and 1d) , which we validated by siRNA knockdown in the context of mumps infection 10 (Supplemental Fig. 3  with two different sgRNAs targeting MTHFD1 (Fig. 2a-2b) . Similarly, in HEK293T cells with 12 MTHFD1 knocked out by two sgRNAs, influenza replication is also inhibited, suggesting a 13 conserved requirement for this gene by influenza virus in human cells (Fig. 2c) . Further virus 14 titration assay demonstrated that MTHFD1 knockdown significantly inhibits viral replication for 15 mumps virus in PaKi cells ( Fig. 2d and 2e) . The effect is similar to the knockdown of SEC61B, a 16 well-studied host protein required for viral replication and a top hit in our RNAi screen (Fig. 2d  17 and 2e) 23 . We additionally tested Melaka virus (PRV3M), a pteropine orthoreovirus that causes 18 acute respiratory disease when transmitted by bats to humans 28 . PRV3M titer was also significantly 19 reduced by MTHFD1 knockdown (Fig. 2e and 2f) . Infection of Zika virus, a member of the 20 flavivirus family, was also inhibited by MTHFD1 knockdown using siRNA (Fig. 2g) . Alternative 21 knockdown with stable expression of two shRNAs validated the requirement of MTHFD1 for the 22 replication of mumps virus and Zika virus (Fig. 2h, 2i and 2j) . Importantly, we also show that this 23 inhibition is completely rescued by overexpression of MTHFD1 from a construct resistant to the 24 shRNA, ruling out potential off-target effects (Fig. 2k) . 25 26 MTHFD1 is a trifunctional enzyme involved in the one carbon (C1) metabolism pathway, which 28 is responsible for cellular production of purine, dTMP and methyl groups 29 . MTHFD1 has three 29 enzymatic functions including dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities encoded in the N-30 terminal domain and formyl tetrahydrofolate (Formyl THF) synthetase activity encoded in the C-31 7 terminal domain ( Fig. 3a and 3b) . We suspected that MTHFD1 knockdown would lead to the 1 deficiency of cellular purine levels thereby reducing RNA replication. Indeed, supplementation of 2 purine analogs, either hypoxanthine or inosine in the media almost completely rescued the 3 replication of influenza A and Zika viruses in MTHFD1-knockout or knockdown PaKi cells as 4 shown by both immunofluorescence staining and virus tittering assay (Fig. 3c, 3d and 3e) . In 5 contrast, supplementation of methyl-group donor or thymidine had little effect on viral replication, 6 evidence that it is the purine synthesis activity of MTHFD1 that is essential for the viral replication 7 (Fig. 3d) . To further pinpoint the enzymatic function of MTHFD1 in viral replication, we 8 performed gene complementation experiments in an shRNA cell line with over 90% knockdown 9 of MTHFD1 (Fig. 2i) . The block of Zika virus replication in this cell line was completely rescued 10 by overexpression of an shRNA-resistant MTHFD1 construct or bat homolog ( Fig. 3f and 3g) . 11 Mutations of MTHFD1 that are known to disrupt its dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities 12 (D125A and R173C) 30,31 did not affect this rescue (Fig. 3b, 3f and 3g) . However, mutations in the 13 Formyl THF synthetase active site (F759A/W788A, or FW/AA) 32 completely abolished this rescue, 14 further supporting that the purine synthesis activity of MTHFD1 is an essential activity for viral 15 replication (Fig. 3b, 3f and 3g) . 16 We observed a similar dependence on MTHFD1 function for influenza A virus infection in 18 HEK293T cells, a human kidney epithelial cell line (Fig. 3h) . Time course experiments 19 demonstrated a viral replication following MTHFD1 knockdown steadily decreased from four 20 hours post-infection with influenza A virus, consistent with a RNA replication defect (Fig. 3i) . 21 This defect in replication was completely rescued by supplementing purine analog inosine in the 22 media, supporting a conserved function of MTHFD1 in viral infection in bats and humans (Fig.  23   3h and 3j, Supplementary Fig. 4) . 24 25 Carolacton, a natural product derived from bacteria, has recently been identified as a potent 27 inhibitor of MTHFD1 33 . We tested the effect of this compound on viral replication. Carolacton 28 inhibited Zika virus and mumps virus replication in PaKi cells in a dose dependent fashion (Fig.  29   4a, 4b and 4c ). The inhibition was achieved at doses with little cytotoxicity (Fig. 4a) . 30 Mechanistically, this inhibition was completely rescued by supplementation of inosine, providing 31 8 support that carolacton indeed exerts antiviral activities by inhibiting MTHFD1 (Fig. 4b and 4c ). 1 Vero E6 cells was effectively inhibited at sub-micromolar concentrations by carolacton (IC 50 =0.14 3 µM) (Fig. 4d) . The cytotoxic effect is very moderate in comparison (Fig. 4d) , supporting a 4 therapeutic window of this compound in potential clinical applications. 5 6 Discussion 7 We developed the first bat genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR libraries and performed two screens 8 with two different RNA viruses. Although the screening methodologies are quite different, we 9 uncovered similar pathways essential for viral replication, namely the endocytosis pathway and 10 protein secretory pathways. The different genes in these two pathways identified from the screens 11 reflect the complementarity of the methodologies, with RNAi screening useful for observing acute 12 effects on viral infection and CRISPR screening for long-term effects on cell survival. Other than 13 technical differences between screening methods, viral kinetics, sensitivity of the viruses to loss-14 of-function of genes, differences in genome coverage within the two libraries likely contributed to 15 the different hits observed in our studies. Both libraries provide valuable and complementary 16 sources that meet the urgent need to address the biological questions of bats. Similar to human 17 genomic libraries, the utility of these bat libraries in screening different cell types of bats, 18 especially those of the immune systems, would unveil more secrets of this enigmatic species. 19 20 Both screens identified MTHFD1 as an essential viral host factor. MTHFD1 is a key enzyme 21 in the C1 metabolism responsible for production of purine, dTMP and methyl group, the first two 22 of which are building blocks for DNA and RNA synthesis. Interestingly, all previous RNAi and 23 CRISPR screens using human cells have not identified MTHFD1 as a host factor. Moreover, we 24 found bats cells and tissues have lower MTHFD1 expression levels than their human counterparts 25 ( Supplementary Fig. 5a, 5b and 5c ). This might be related to the difference in the promoter 26 regions between bats and humans, notably a lack of CCAAT box 34 in the promoter of two bat 27 species (Supplementary Fig. 5d) . We show that MTHFD1 knockdown blocks replication of 28 multiple RNA viruses, including influenza virus, mumps virus, Melaka virus and Zika virus. 29 Importantly, host cells have a higher tolerance for MTHFD1 inhibition than viruses, potentially 30 providing a therapeutic window for targeting MTHFD1 with antiviral drugs. Virus infection 31 9 converts the whole cellular machinery into a factory to massively produce progeny viruses, which 1 explains the vital dependence on MTHFD1. This is analogous to cancer cell's addiction to non-2 oncogenic gene functions such as many metabolic enzymes 35 . Similar to the therapeutic targeting 3 of these non-oncogenic addictions for developing cancer drugs, these viral addictions to metabolic 4 enzymes such as MTHFD1 could open doors to many new opportunities for developing broad-5 spectrum antiviral drugs 36 . These drugs could be readily applied in emerging epidemics, as 6 demonstrated by our evidence here that MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton can suppress the infection 7 of SARS-CoV-2. We envision the functional genomics tools we provided here will be instrumental 8 to further discoveries by better understanding the bat-virus interaction. 9 10 Reference 11 1 Leroy, E. M. et al.

906f02fe0ce144bb743cd541eaa565829015fd17	Background: Despite being in the 5th month of pandemic, knowledge with respect to viral dynamics, infectivity and RT-PCR positivity continues to evolve. Aim: To analyse the SARS CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR profiles in COVID-19 patients . Design: It was a retrospective, observational study conducted at COVID facilities under AIIMS, New Delhi. Methods : Patients admitted with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for enrolment. Patients with incomplete details, or only single PCR tests were excluded. Data regarding demographic details, comorbidities, treatment received and results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, collected at different time points, was retrieved from the hospital records. Results : 298 patients were included, majority were males (75·8%) with mean age of 39·07 years (0·6-88 years). The mean duration from symptom onset to first positive RT-PCR was 4·7 days (SD 3·67), while that of symptom onset to last positive test was 17·83 days (SD 6·22). Proportions of positive RT-PCR tests were 100%, 49%, 24%, 8·7% and 20·6% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4 th & >4 weeks of illness. 12 symptomatic patients had prolonged positive test results even after 3 weeks of symptom onset. Age >= 60 years was associated with prolonged RT-PCR positivity (statistically significant). Conclusion : This study showed that the average period of PCR positivity is more than 2 weeks in COVID-19 patients; elderly patients have prolonged duration of RT-PCR positivity and requires further follow up.

Abstract: Background: Total hip replacement (THR) is a standard procedure for diseased or damaged hips for which several functional scoring tools are available to evaluate the outcomes. Majority of these scores were devised in western countries and their cross-cultural compatibility is rarely demonstrated. The World Health Organisation quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire is one of the best known multilingual instruments for such assessment which has 4 domains. Its reliability has never been demonstrated for THR and the present study was conceptualised for the same. Methods: THRs done over 6 years were followed up retrospectively. Revision THRs and hemiarthroplasties were excluded. All the cases were done by a single senior arthroplasty surgeon. Clinical examination was done and questionnaires for WHO QOL-BREF and Harris Hip scores were given to the patients. Results: The number of patients included in the study was 96 with 115 operated hips. The average age of these patients was 41.40 years ranging from 17 to 80 years. There was strong male preponderance in our series of patients with 90 THRs. The mean score of domain 1 was 70.8 (SD 21.6), domain 2: 72.4 (SD 18.8), domain 3: 74.7 (SD 16.8) and domain 4: 75.4 (SD 14.8), which showed significant functional improvement post THR in domain 2 (P = 0.0001), domain 3 (P = 0.0010) and domain 4(P= 0.0001), when compared to scores of general healthy population. Similarly, the scores were significantly improved in all domains as compared to cohorts of post-operative acetabular and hip fractures. The score was found to be a reliable tool with Cronbach's alpha of 0.912 and strong correlation was present with the standard Harris hip scores (p=0.000). Conclusion: WHO QOL is a potent tool to assess the quality of life in patients undergoing THR. It can be used as a single index of measurement and it is simple, reproducible and reliable.
77eb2dc4442518f5757a339ddea166750afeafd1	The network theory of autoimmunity is presented with recent experimental data relevant to the understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS. Schematically, effector T cells specific for self-antigens exist normally, but their activity is modulated and prevented by networks of regulatory T cells. As a result of mimicry between molecular components of microorganisms and self-antigens, autoimmune disease can be triggered by specific foreign pathogens which alter the state of activity of the network from suppression to activation. Conversely, by a procedure known as T-cell vaccination, autologous effector T cells re-injected after in vitro stimulation and attenuation may alter the state of the network from an activation to a suppression. Numerous observations are reviewed that support the concept of autoimmune activity in the destruction of non-infected T4 cells. Such activity is presumed to be triggered by an antigen of viral origin, the most likely, but not the only one, being the envelope protein gpl20. Based on this hypothesis, a T-cell vaccination procedure against effector T cells responsible for autoimmunopathic activity in HIV-seropositive patients is proposed, similar to the one known from experimental study of autoimmunity and presently being tested in human autoimmune diseases. Its purpose would be to prevent T-cell loss and the onset of immunodeficiency disease in HIV-seropositive patients. Apart from its potential therapeutic value, this procedure will have use as a therapeutic test from which insight will be gained about the immunopathogenesis of AIDS.
181bef55321b315c053d17800f248442f38d15fa	A community is a subset of a wider network where the members of that subset are more strongly connected to each other than they are to the rest of the network. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying and tracking communities in graphs that change over time -dynamic community detection -and present a framework based on Riemannian geometry to aid in this task. Our framework currently supports several important operations such as interpolating between and averaging over graph snapshots. We compare these Riemannian methods with entry-wise linear interpolation and find that the Riemannian methods are generally better suited to dynamic community detection. Next steps with the Riemannian framework include producing a Riemannian least-squares regression method for working with noisy data and developing support methods, such as spectral sparsification, to improve the scalability of our current methods.
265550669ed69c2cf7a7a76fe0a3bad644dbb8a8	Parasites and pathogens are a fundamental driving force in the ecology and evolution of mammalian populations, and understanding disease processes in natural populations is an urgent priority in the face of increased rates of infectious disease emergence. In this review, we argue that mammalogists are uniquely placed to contribute to addressing these challenges because in-depth knowledge of mammal species is fundamental to the development of wild model systems that could accelerate discovery in disease ecology. The use of animal models-species for which a broad range of diagnostic, molecular, and genetic tools have been developed-in tightly controlled laboratory environments has been instrumental in driving progress in the biomedical sciences. However, in natural populations, disease processes operate in the context of enormous genetic, phenotypic, and environmental variability. Understanding diseases in animal populations (including humans) thus requires investment in "wild animal models" that explicitly include individual variation and relevant environmental gradients. Wild mammal groups such as primates and rodents have already been identified as potentially useful models of infectious diseases in the wild. Here, we discuss the enormous potential that ungulates hold as candidates for wild model systems. The diversity, broad geographic distribution, and often high abundance of species in this group make them a highly accessible target for disease research. Moreover, a depth of background knowledge, close relationships to domesticated animals, and ongoing management of many wild ungulate species provide context, tools, and opportunity for cutting-edge research at the interface of ecological and biomedical sciences. Studies of wild ungulates are already helping to unravel some key challenges in infectious disease research, including the role of parasites in trophic cascades, the consequences of climate change for disease dynamics, and the systems biology of host-parasite interactions. Other areas where ungulate studies may provide new insight include research on the sources and drivers of emerging infectious diseases.
03cc61010171d8c71d4350f18d7c57e8b90cd5bb	Infectious disease outbreaks recapitulate biology: they emerge from the multi-level interaction of hosts, pathogens, and their shared environment. As a result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks-e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic equipment, importation probability etc.-is feasible 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 . Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction 10, 11, 12, 13 . To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability 14 . Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks-including, chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis A, influenza, Zika, measles, polio, whooping cough, and mumpswe identify a fundamental entropy barrier for infectious disease time series forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed differences in predictability across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches to arXiv:1703.07317v4 [physics.soc-ph] 
db7335913f1efeb4a38635bb601f43d04fefe380	Medical Information Systems (MIS) help medical practice and health care significantly. Security and dependability are two increasingly important factors for MIS nowadays. In one hand, people would be willing to step into the MIS age only when their privacy and integrity can be protected and guaranteed with MIS systems. On the other hand, only secure and reliable MIS systems would provide safe and solid medical and health care service to people. In this paper, we discuss some new security and reliability technologies which are necessary for and can be integrated with existing MISs and make the systems highly secure and dependable. We also present an implemented Middleware architecture which has been integrated with the existing VISTA/CPRS system in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs seamlessly and transparently.
ccc4abafa621d96c1095cb20f6220a7ddf5e1aca	Background: Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) accounting for near 20% of renal cell carcinoma is the second most common histological subtype. MiRNAs have been demonstrated to played significant roles on predicting prognosis of patients with tumors. An appropriate and comprehensive miRNAs analysis based on a great deal of pRCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) will provide perspective in this field. We integrated the expression of mRNAs, miRNAs and the relevant clinical data of 321 pRCC patients recorded in the TCGA database. The survival-related differential expressed miRNAs (sDEmiRs) were estimated by COX regression analysis. The high-risk group and the low-risk group were separated by the median risk score of the risk score model (RSM) based on three screened sDEmiRs. The target genes, underlying molecular mechanisms of these sDEmiRs were explored by computational biology. The expression levels of the three sDEmiRs and their correlations with clinicopathological parameters were further validated by qPCR. Results: Based on univariate COX analysis (P < 0.001), eighteen differential expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) were remarkably related with the overall survival (OS) of pRCC patients. Three sDEmiRs with the most significant prognostic values (miR-34a-5p, miR-410-3p and miR-6720-3p) were employed to establish the RSM which was certified as an independent prognosis factor and closely correlated with OS. In the verification of clinical samples, the overexpression of miR-410-3p and miR-6720-3p were detected to be associated with the advanced T-stages, while miR-34a-5p showed the reversed results. The study developed a RSM based on the identified sDEmiRs with significant prognosis prediction values for pRCC patients. The results pave the avenue for establishing and optimizing a reliable and referable risk assessing model and provide novel insight into the researches of biomarkers and clinical treatment strategies. With the increasing morbidity, papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) accounting for near 20% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), has transcended into the second most common histological subtype [1, 2] . Following the new WHO classification of RCC subtypes, pRCC was identified to be the type 1 and 2 on basis of the histopathological morphology [3, 4] . Characterized by the multifarious biological behaviors of nonreactivity or invasiveness, pRCC usually emerged as the focal or heterogeneous multifocal tumor [5] . In the past few years, a growing body of researchers have been focusing on the pRCC to discover the pathogenesis and pathological features and further explore the effective treatments, of which targeted therapies and immunotherapies are attracting increasing attentions [6, 7] .
07aaa611260b496f03bb7e106172799cd8d3b689	Fake news that manipulates political elections, strikes financial systems and even incites riots is more viral than real news online, resulting in unstable societies and buffeted democracy. The easier contagion of fake news online can be causally explained by the greater anger it carries. Offline questionnaires reveal that anger leads to more incentivized audiences in terms of anxiety management and information sharing and accordingly makes fake news more contagious than real news online. Our results suggest that the digital contagion of emotions, in particular anger, should be comprehensively considered in profiling the spread of online information. Cures such as tagging anger in social media could be implemented to slow or prevent the contagion of fake news at the source. Fake news refers to information that is fabricated, misleading, and verifiably false (1, 2). Most people broadly accept information instead of critically questioning its authenticity (1). In particular, with the boom of social media, on which individuals can be simultaneously producers and consumers of information, ordinary people can easily participate in circulation and gain influence through posting (e.g., tweeting) and reposting (e.g., retweeting). Consequently, the 1
1409c72e99d3620128d50cb0704cbbdcf723ebc0	COVID-19 has circled the globe, rapidly expanding from an outbreak in China to a pandemic in a matter of weeks. Lacking an effective vaccine or proven, pharmaceutical therapy, countries have enacted an unprecedented series of non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat this disease. However, the potential for variation in free-living virus survival to modulate the efficacy of these interventions remains unclear. Using an empirically determined understanding of SARS-CoV-2 natural history and detailed, country-level case data, we elucidate how variation in free-living virus survival influences key features of COVID-19 epidemics. Our findings suggest that COVID-19's basic reproductive number (ℛ0) and other key signatures of outbreak intensity are modulated by transmission between infected individuals and the environment. In addition, country-level outbreaks vary in the degree to which environmental transmission appears to modulate COVID-19 dynamics. Summarizing, we propose that informed models of "sit and wait," environmental transmission are essential in emerging outbreaks, as they highlight how variation in environmental transmission may explain observed differences in disease dynamics from setting to setting, and can inform public health interventions.
5e77269850b7b4bf57514e226ea66cd48ac31db5	The recognition of sialic acids by two strains of minute virus of mice (MVM), MVMp (prototype) and MVMi (immunosuppressive), is an essential requirement for successful infection. To understand the potential for recognition of different modifications of sialic acid by MVM, three types of capsids, virus-like particles, wild type empty (no DNA) capsids, and DNA packaged virions, were screened on a sialylated glycan microarray (SGM). Both viruses demonstrated a preference for binding to 9-O-methylated sialic acid derivatives, while MVMp showed additional binding to 9-O-acetylated and 9-Olactoylated sialic acid derivatives, indicating recognition differences. The glycans recognized contained a type-2 Galb1-4GlcNAc motif (Neu5Aca2-3Galb1-4GlcNAc or 39SIA-LN) and were biantennary complex-type N-glycans with the exception of one. To correlate the recognition of the 39SIA-LN glycan motif as well as the biantennary structures to their natural expression in cell lines permissive for MVMp, MVMi, or both strains, the N-and O-glycans, and polar glycolipids present in three cell lines used for in vitro studies, A9 fibroblasts, EL4 T lymphocytes, and the SV40 transformed NB324K cells, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The cells showed an abundance of the sialylated glycan motifs recognized by the viruses in the SGM and previous glycan microarrays supporting their role in cellular recognition by MVM. Significantly, the NB324K showed fucosylation at the non-reducing end of their biantennary glycans, suggesting that recognition of these cells is possibly mediated by the Lewis X motif as in 39SIA-Le X identified in a previous glycan microarray screen.
390986fafd862ce729f6b70687723d8c002e58a8	Background: Drug safety assessments in clinical trials present unique analytical challenges. Some of these include adjusting for individual follow-up time, repeated measurements of multiple outcomes and missing data among others. Furthermore, pre-specifying appropriate analysis becomes difficult as some safety endpoints are unexpected. Although existing guidelines such as CONSORT encourage thorough reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials, they provide limited details for safety data analysis. The limited guidelines may influence suboptimal analysis by failing to account for some analysis challenges above. A typical example where such challenges exist are trials of anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy. Lack of proper standardized evaluation of the safety of antimalarial drugs has limited the ability to draw conclusions about safety. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to establish the current practice in statistical analysis for preventive antimalarial drug safety in pregnancy. Eighteen trials were included in this review that collected multiple longitudinal safety outcomes including AEs. Statistical analysis and reporting of the safety outcomes in all the trials used descriptive statistics; proportions/ counts (n = 18, 100%) and mean/median (n = 2, 11.1%). Results presentation included tabular (n = 16, 88.9%) and text description (n = 2, 11.1%). Univariate inferential methods were reported in most trials (n = 16, 88.9%); including Chi square/Fisher's exact test (n = 12, 66.7%), t test (n = 2, 11.1%) and Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon test (n = 1, 5.6%). Multivariable methods, including Poisson and negative binomial were reported in few trials (n = 3, 16.7%). Assessment of a potential link between missing efficacy data and safety outcomes was not reported in any of the trials that reported efficacy missing data (n = 7, 38.9%). The review demonstrated that statistical analysis of safety data in anti-malarial drugs for malarial chemoprevention in pregnancy RCTs is inadequate. The analyses insufficiently account for multiple safety outcomes potential dependence, follow-up time and informative missing data which can compromise anti-malarial drug safety evidence development, based on the available data.

c6a8746299c87ada798da94722bc680192cc5c3b	Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak due to novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has come out as a major threat for mankind in recent times. It is continually taking an enormous toll on mankind by means of increasing number of deaths, associated comorbidities, and socioeconomic loss around the globe. Unavailability of chemotherapeutics/vaccine has posed tremendous challenges to scientists and doctors for developing an urgent therapeutic strategy. In this connection, the present in silico study aims to understand the sequence divergence of spike protein (the major infective protein of SARS-CoV-2), its mode of interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) receptor of human and related animal hosts/reservoir. Moreover, the involvement of the human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) against the spike protein has also been demonstrated. Our data indicated that the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically close to bat coronavirus and strongly binds with ACE2 receptor protein from both human and bat origin. We have also found that cell surface TLRs, especially TLR4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from SARS-CoV-2 to induce inflammatory responses. The present study supported the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 from a bat and also revealed that TLR4 may have a crucial role in the virus-induced inflammatory consequences associated with COVID-19. Therefore, selective targeting of TLR4-spike protein interaction by designing competitive TLR4-antagonists could pave a new way to treat COVID-19. Finally, this study is expected to improve our understanding on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 and could be useful in adopting spike protein, ACE2, or TLR-guided intervention strategy against COVID-19 shortly.
6edec9177333536bb1dfc83363cefba4bf0dc66b	We propose three different data-driven approaches for pricing European-style call options using supervised machine-learning algorithms. The proposed approaches are tested on two stock market indices: NIFTY50 and BANKNIFTY from the Indian equity market. Although neither historical nor implied volatility is used as an input, the results show that the trained models have been able to capture the option pricing mechanism better than or similar to the BlackScholes formula for all the experiments. Our choice of scale free I/O allows us to train models using combined data of multiple different assets from a financial market. This not only allows the models to achieve far better generalization and predictive capability, but also solves the problem of paucity of data, the primary limitation of using machine learning techniques. We also illustrate the performance of the trained models in the period leading up to the 2020 Stock Market Crash
da61ba390074e5f571e99f61cbe8f0f7bc9088d8	Traditional screening for COVID-19 typically includes survey questions about symptoms, travel history, and sometimes temperature measurements. We explored whether longitudinal, personal sensor data can help identify subtle changes which may indicate an infection, such as COVID-19. To do this we developed an app that collects smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-reported symptoms and diagnostic testing results from participants living in the US. We assessed whether symptoms and sensor data could differentiate COVID-19 positive versus negative cases in symptomatic individuals. Between March 25 and June 7, 2020, we enrolled 30,529 participants, of whom 3,811 reported symptoms, 54 reported testing positive for COVID-19, and 279 negative. We found that a combination of symptom and sensor data resulted in an AUC=0.80 [0.73 -0.86] which was significantly better (p < 0.01) than a model which just considered symptoms alone (AUC=0.71 [0.63 -0.79]) in the discrimination between symptomatic individuals positive or negative for COVID-19. Such orthogonal, continuous, passively captured data may be complementary to virus testing that is generally a one-off, or infrequent, sampling assay.
84bafc34e5e1118ed2da16a02c87e472e0dd0d4c	Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on epithelial, endothelial and immune cells. CEACAM1 is a differentiation antigen involved in the maintenance of epithelial polarity that is induced during hepatocyte differentiation and liver regeneration. CEACAM1 regulates insulin sensitivity by promoting hepatic insulin clearance, and controls liver tolerance and mucosal immunity. Obese insulin-resistant humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease manifest loss of hepatic CEACAM1. In mice, deletion or functional inactivation of CEACAM1 impairs insulin clearance and compromises metabolic homeostasis which initiates the development of obesity and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis with other features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and adipogenesis in white adipose depot. This is followed by inflammation and endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunctions. In obstructive and inflammatory liver diseases, soluble CEACAM1 is shed into human bile where it can serve as an indicator of liver disease. On immune cells, CEACAM1 acts as an immune checkpoint regulator, and deletion of Ceacam1 gene in mice causes exacerbation of inflammation and hyperactivation of myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Hence, hepatic CEACAM1 resides at the central hub of immune and metabolic homeostasis in both humans and mice. This review focuses on the regulatory role of CEACAM1 in liver and biliary tract architecture in health and disease, and on its metabolic role and function as an immune checkpoint regulator of hepatic inflammation.
4a7f4fc5641ee4b954a8c823c7c23858d0f9bd9b	In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases. Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness. To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics. In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R 0 . Without self-isolation, when R 0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R 0 = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of selfisolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.

Die Dissektion der A. hepatica im Besonderen ist dabei mit einer Häufigkeit von 20-50 % aller AVA je nach Patientenkollektiv und Publikation einzustufen. Im klinischen Alltag stiegen die Dissektionsraten mittlerweile jedoch bei zunehmender endoskopischer bzw. interventioneller Therapie hepatobiliärer Erkrankungen in den letzten Jahren zunehmend an. Das Ziel dieses wissenschaftlichen "Case reports" über ein außergewöhnliches Fallbeispiel besteht darin, den sehr seltenen aber repräsentativen Kasus einer Patientin mit Dissektion der A. hepatica propria (AHP), die mit einer Häufigkeit von 20-50 % aller viszeralen Aneurysmen (AVA) einzustufen ist, anhand von Symptomatik, weiterführender Diagnostik und befundspezifisch angezeigter Therapieoptionen zu veranschaulichen. Fall (Anamnese-, Befund-, Diagnostik-, Therapie-und Outcome-assoziierte Aspekte): Anamnese und klinischer Befund: Eine 60-jährige Patientin wurde notfallmäßig bei seit 4 h bestehenden kolikartigen Schmerzen im rechten Oberbauch sowie hypertensiver Entgleisung und erhöhtem CrP in einem auswärtigen Krankenhaus vorstellig. Im Röntgen-Thorax/Abdomen gab es kein Anzeichen für einen Ileus oder eine Perforation. In der abdominellen Sonografie bestand der dringende V.a. eine Raumforderung an der rechten Niere. Im CT-Abdomen mit KM zeigte sich (angeblich) eine Dissektion der A. hepatica communis. Therapie: Die Patientin wurde zunächst mittels Heparinperfusor therapeutisch mit 1.000 IE/h PTT-gesteuert antikoaguliert. Unter adäquater Analgesie und Spasmolyse besserten sich die Beschwerden. Die begleitende hypertensive Krise war unter Vocado gut führbar. Verlauf: Die Patientin wurde daraufhin per RTW und Hubschrauber in das hiesige Universitätsklinikum via ITS überwiesen. Hier zeigte sich die Patientin kardiopulmonal stabil, klinisch am Abdomen idem, weiter nur gering erhöhtes CRP. Eine Duplex-Sonografie detektierte eine suffiziente Perfusion des beschriebenen Dissektionssegments und peripher kein Aneurysma. Bei nicht vollends einsehbarem "Re-entry" war eine aktuelle CT-Angio indiziert, die eine Dissektion der AHP bis weit in die A. hepatica dextra (AHD) hinein eruierte. Bei kreislaufstabilem AZ erfolgte die Verlegung der Patientin auf die gefäßchirurgische Normalstation. Eine Thrombozytenaggregationshemmung mittels ASS 100 wurde zusätzlich initiiert. Interdisziplinäre Entscheidungsfindung -finales Procedere: Bei Ausdehnung der Dissektion von der AHP bis tief in die AHD sowie einem Durchmesser(Ø) der AHP von 6,4 mm bestand unter Berücksichtigung aller Therapieoptionen und Risiken incl. der aktuellen Leitlinien keine Indikation zur endovaskulären oder gefäßchirurgischen Befundsanierung. Die Patientin wurde unter engmaschiger Blutdruckkontrolle (Ziel: < 140 mmHg systolisch) unter Vocado, ASS, Novalgin und Buscopan bei Bedarf entlassen mit geplanter klinischer und Duplex-sonografischer Verlaufskontrolle in 3 Monaten, die unauffällig ausfiel. Schlussfolgerung: Die sehr seltene Dissektion der A. hepatica ist in den meisten Fällen eine nebenbefundlich gestellte und bildmorphologisch gesicherte Diagnose. Die diagnostischen Methoden der Wahl sind neben der Duplexsonografie eine CT-oder MR-Angio. Therapieoptionen umfassen die perkutane endovaskuläre Therapie sowie die offen-chirurgische oder laparoskopische Sanierung. Eine Therapie wird bei allen AVA ab Ø von 2 cm empfohlen, ab 5 cm ist sie indiziert. Bei < 2 cm oder in Ausnahmefällen zwischen 2 und 5 cm kann eine konservative Therapie unter regelmäßigen Kontrollen (alle 3-6 Monate) erwogen werden. Im beschriebenen Fall war eine interventionelle Therapie unter Berücksichtigung von Ausdehnung, Lage und des geringen Ø der dissezierten Arterie bei a.e. induzierter Symptomatik unter entgleistem Hypertonus nicht erforderlich mit der Maßgabe eines engmaschigen "Follow-up"s. Internist 2020 · 61 (Suppl 1): S1-S73 Background and Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an elevated risk of fractures. The fracture risk increases with diabetes duration and poor glycaemic control. Medications such as insulin, glinides (GL), sulfonylureas (SU) as well as sodium-glucose linked transporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are suspected to play a role in fracture risk. The aim was to examine the relationship between haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or type of treatment and fractures in patients with T2DM aged ≥ 50 years. Methods: 4,821 T2DM patients with documented fractures during the last 12 months from a multicentre registry (DPV) were compared to 349,179 T2DM patients without any documented fracture. Multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for demographics, were used to determine the percentage of patients with fractures among HbA1c groups (low (HbA1c < 6.5%); intermediate (HbA1c 6.5-9%); high (HbA1c > 9%)) and type of treatment (Insulin/GL/SU vs other oral antidiabetics (OAD) and lifestyle). SGLT2i were compared to the OAD group (without GL/ SU/SGLT2i). These analyses were performed for the entire cohort and stratified by sex. Additionally, hip fractures (n = 1171) were analysed separately. Results: Unadjusted statistics revealed that 1.36% of patients with T2DM had any fracture (0.33% hip fracture). Patients with fracture were more often female (63% vs 47%), older (median 77.8 [Q1; Q3: 69.7; 83.8] vs 71.6 [63.2; 78.8] years) and had longer diabetes duration (11.5 [6.6; 18.8] vs 9.2 [3.5; 15.8] years) compared to patients without fractures. Adjusted for demographics, women had more fractures (1.33 [CI: 1.27 -1.40] % vs 0.80 [0.76 -0.85] %; p < 0.01) and more hip fractures (0.23 [0.21 -0.26] % vs 0.12 [0.11 -0.14] %; p < 0.01) than men. The risk for any fracture decreased with increasing HbA1c (low: 1.15 [1.08 -1.22] %; intermediate: 0.92 [0.87 -0.97] %; high: 0.72 [0.65 -0.80] %; p < 0.01). The same tendency was observed for hip fractures (low: 0.19 [0.16 -0.22] %; intermediate: 0.13 [0.12 -0.15] %; high: 0.08 [0.06 -0.10] %; p < 0.01). Analysing females and males separately, similar results were found. The comparison (adjusted for demographics) between treatment with Insulin/GL/SU (n=207,080) and other OAD/lifestyle (n = 146,920) revealed a higher percentage of any fracture in the other OAD/lifestyle group (female: 1.53 [1.43 -1.64] % vs 1.28 [1.20 -1.36] %; p < 0.01; male: 0.89 [0.82 -0.97] % vs 0.72 [0.67 -0.77] %; p < 0.01). Women treated with SGLT2i (n = 1,240) revealed a higher proportion of any fracture (2.05 [1.36 -3.08]) % compared to the other OAD (without GL/SU/SGLT2i; n=26,811) group (1.25 [1.11 -1.41] %; p = 0.02). Patients with low HbA1c values were associated with the highest percentage for any or hip fractures. This is consistent with the hypothesis that these patients have a higher risk of hypoglycaemia. On the other side, the higher proportion of patients with fractures in the OAD/lifestyle group compared to the Insulin/GL/SU group suggests that patients with low HbA1c might have a higher fracture risk as they probably are more active. Female patients have higher fracture risk if they are treated with SGLT2i, which are said to be involved in bone turnover.

Our approach combines advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) with conventional molecular docking to rapidly explore chemical space conditioned on the unique physiochemical properties of the active site of a biomolecular target. As a proof-ofconcept, we used our framework to construct a focused library for cyclin-dependent kinase type-2 (CDK2). We then used it to rapidly generate a library specific to the active site of the main protease (M pro ) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. By comparing approved and experimental drugs to compounds in our library, we also identified six drugs, namely, Naratriptan, Etryptamine, Panobinostat, Procainamide, Sertraline, and Lidamidine, as possible SARS-CoV-2 M pro targeting compounds and, as such, potential drug repurposing candidates. To complement the open-science COVID-19 drug discovery initiatives, we make our SARS-CoV-2 M pro library fully accessible to the research community (https://github.com/atfrank/SARS-CoV-2).

Currently, there is no effective approved vaccine for CCHF. In this study, we used a computer-aided vaccine design approach to develop the first multi-epitope recombinant vaccine for CCHF. For this purpose, linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from two structural glycoproteins of CCHF virus including Gc and Gn were predicted. The epitopes were further studied regarding their antigenicity, allergenicity, hydrophobicity, stability, toxicity and population coverage. A total number of seven epitopes including five T-cell and two B-cell epitopes were screened for the final vaccine construct. Final vaccine construct composed of 382 amino acid residues which were organized in four domains including linear B-cell, T-cell epitopes and cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB) along with heat labile enterotoxin IIc B subunit (LT-IIc) as adjuvants. All the segments were joined using appropriate linkers. The physicochemical properties as well as the presence of IFN-γ inducing epitopes in the proposed vaccine, was also checked to determining the vaccine stability, solubility and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. The 3D structure of proposed vaccine was subjected to the prediction of computational B-cell epitopes and molecular docking studies with MHC-I and II molecules. Furthermore, molecular dynamics stimulations were performed to study the vaccine-MHCs complexes stability during stimulation time. The results suggest that our proposed vaccine was stable, well soluble in water and potentially antigenic. Results also demonstrated that the vaccine can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and could serve as a promising anti-CCHF vaccine candidate.
96e9bf5d58a1ba692047da7ffc07a3e1fb86c4da	A recombinant SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein vaccine produced in insect cells in a pre-clinical development stage is described. A truncated version of S glycoprotein, containing only the ecto-domain, as well as a His-tagged full-length version were cloned and expressed in a serum-free insect cell line, ExpresSF+ ® . The proteins, purified to apparent homogeneity by liquid column chromatography, were formulated without adjuvant at 3, 9, 27, and 50 g per dose in phosphate saline and used to immunize mice. Both antigens in each formulation elicited a strong immune response after two or three vaccinations with the antigen. Neutralizing antibody titers correlated closely with standard ELISA reactivity against the S glycoprotein. The truncated S protein was also formulated with an adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide, at 1 g per dose (±adjuvant), and 5 g per dose (±adjuvant). Significantly enhanced immune responses, manifested by higher titers of serum ELISA and viral neutralizing antibodies, were achieved in adjuvanted groups with fewer doses and lower concentration of S glycoprotein. These findings indicate that the ecto-domain of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein vaccine, with or without adjuvant, is immunogenic and induces high titers of virus neutralizing antibodies to levels similar to those achieved with the full S glycoprotein vaccine. The development of SARS-CoV vaccines has become a priority for preparedness for future outbreaks to protect health care workers managing new cases as well as the general population. A Phase I clinical trial using killed-whole SARS-CoV vaccine has been conducted by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. However, concerns have been raised for the use of inactivated virus vaccines based on observations with feline coronavirus. There are also several subunit vaccines in pre-clinical development, targeting SARS-CoV structural proteins, including the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Other vaccine candidates include vector-based DNA vaccines [7-11], a combination of whole killed virus and DNA vaccines [12], inactivated whole virus vaccines [13, 14] , a combination of DNA and S-peptide vaccines [15] , and other recombinant proteins and their fragments. 0264-410X/$ -see front matter
7b04d71c703a3c902fbc0c50db8c86292724f165	Testing is an important phase of every software system, as it can reveal defects early and contribute to achieving high software quality. In this process of quality assurance, organizations are usually relying on one testing technique. However, a combination of techniques may prove more beneficial to the organization, as it might give the chance to discover a larger number of defects early. In order to examine the above, in the current work we present a survey on the use of system testing methodologies. We have gathered data from 252 individuals that reveal current trends in testing, such as whether requirements are used in the test case definition and whether the testing techniques used are affected by parameters, such as years of experience, whereas we examine the combination of smoke testing and regression testing. We also demonstrate an industrial use case, where this combination was applied, reducing the number of defects identified by the customer.
f3cfe8b231b7e6eae047c88e9f3dab8612eb8ec4	The coronavirus is spreading rapidly across the country but India's testing regime is far from the global standards. It is important to identify the states where testing needs expansion and the magnitudes of active COVID cases are higher focusing on current health infrastructure to meet the pandemic. The data on COVID-19 was extracted from the Application Programming Interface. Test positive rate, test per confirmed case, recovery rate, case fatality rate, and percent distribution of active cases were computed. Availability of hospitals, hospital beds, intensive care unit and ventilators per lakh population was also computed by public and private sector. The result revealed that, Maharashtra constitutes more than one-third positive cases in the country. More than a quarter of the active cases in India belonged to the Mumbai district of Maharashtra, followed by the Chennai district (9.4%) and Ahmedabad district (9.1%). Further, about 40 percent of the active cases in India belonged to the 11 districts of Maharashtra. The increased test positive rate in Maharashtra and Gujarat to almost double in last one month is a concern. In order to bring the states and the country in right track, the test positive rate need to be brought down to below 2 percent. The procurement of higher number of high throughput machine, the Cobas 6800 testing machine, is need of the hour. Only few states have adequate health infrastructure. The priority should be the laid on expansion of more laboratories and hospitals, storage of PPE kit, testing kit, and indigenously developed vaccines.
253c524bd6c14b1df0a6340e310672113d359991	The 2014 Ebola crisis has highlighted public-health vulnerabilities in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea-countries ravaged by extreme poverty, deforestation and mining-related disruption of livelihoods and ecosystems, and bloody civil wars in the cases of Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola's emergence and impact are grounded in the legacy of colonialism and its creation of enduring inequalities within African nations and globally, via neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus. Recent experiences with new and emerging diseases such as SARS and various strains of HN influenzas have demonstrated the effectiveness of a coordinated local and global public health and education-oriented response to contain epidemics. To what extent is international assistance to fight Ebola strengthening local public health and medical capacity in a sustainable way, so that other emerging disease threats, which are accelerating with climate change, may be met successfully? This chapter considers the wide-ranging socio-political, medical, legal and environmental factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola, with particular emphasis on the politics of the global and public health response and the role of gender, social inequality, colonialism and racism as they relate to the mobilization and establishment of the public health infrastructure required to combat Ebola and other emerging diseases in times of climate change. The Ebola crisis of 2014-2015 holds a number of lessons regarding global preparedness to meet the challenges posed by emerging diseases in times of climate change. These lessons relate to the causes and origins of the Ebola spread, the initial responses to the epidemic at the local level, international responses and their longterm effects, and global disparities in health access. This chapter brings together a range of facts and commentary about the Ebola epidemic, focusing on the role of climate change in exacerbating socio-economic vulnerabilities, and extending the discussion and analysis to future/emerging diseases and their relation to global climate change. By combining discourse analysis and sources of public information about the Ebola crisis such as newspapers and online sources with statistics and academic analyses of local health systems, global institutions, climate change-induced weather patterns, social institutions, public opinion, economic trends, investment and urbanization, we present an interdisciplinary contextual analysis of emergent pressures on local health systems in times of climate change, with global implications. While direct causality among factors is nearly impossible to "prove" in complex circumstances such as this, systems researchers rely on such triangulation and multiple evidence-based methodologies to track trends and make sense of emergent linked phenomena (Klenk and Meehan 2015; Poteete et al. 2010; Roe 1998; Moran-Ellis et al. 2006) . The literature on hazards and disasters distinguishes between the former as being a precondition (in the form of a hazardous agent or circumstance) to a disaster. A hazard is therefore a disaster waiting to happen. Hazardous conditions set the stage for a disaster to occur. In the case of Ebola, the hazardous agent is the virus itself. The virus itself does not in itself "cause" the outbreak, just as a hazard in itself does not "cause" the disaster. Rather, the social, political, cultural, economic and biophysical conditions and factors we write about in this chapter all contributed to enabling the disease to spread. Here the enablement of disease spread also, notably, extends to the outbreak response, including how these numerous factors hindered the outbreak response. The following section discusses the Ebola epidemic's roots in globalization, international trade pressures, financial flows, Bretton Woods institutions, incapacity and created weakness in African health-care systems, and the prospects for addressing these inequities as climate change worsens. Section 3 "Ebola's Roots in Extended Urbanization", gives more detail on how mining, transportation networks, urbanization, and the scale of environmental-economic transformations both in Africa and worldwide lead to the conditions in which new diseases emerge and spread. In section 4 "Health Infrastructure, Climate Change, and Ebola's Spread", photos and statistics demonstrate the relationship between climate change, poverty,

05c759c20347c800ffdf5bc214bcfc46ea9890bd	The very rapid evolution of urban areas leads to a reflection on the citizens' mobility inside the cities. This mobility problem is highlighted by the increase in terms of time, distance and social and economic costs, whereas the congestion management approach implemented rarely meets the road users' expectations. To overcome this problem, a novel approach for evaluating urban traffic congestion is proposed. Factors such as the imprecision of traffic records, the user's perception of the road's level of service provided and variation in sample data are mandatory to describe the real traffic condition. To respond to these requirements, a fuzzy inference-based method is suggested. It combines three independent congestion measures which are: speed ratio, volume to capacity ratio and decreased speed ratio into a single composite measure which is the congestion index. To run the proposed fuzzy model, the traffic dataset of Austin-Texas is used. Although it is still not possible to determine the best congestion measure, the proposed approach gives a composite aspect of traffic congestion by combining and incorporating the uncertainty of the three independent measures.

3b0b0f730fbd22ac5857143b28950a28e7b458e1	Bats are notorious reservoirs of several zoonotic diseases and may be uniquely tolerant of infection among mammals. Broad sampling has revealed the importance of bats in the diversification and spread of viruses and eukaryotes to other animal hosts. Vector-borne bacteria of the genus Bartonella are prevalent and diverse in mammals globally and recent surveys have revealed numerous Bartonella lineages in bats. We assembled a sequence database of Bartonella strains, consisting of nine genetic loci from 209 previously characterized lineages and 121 new cultured strains from bats, and used these data to perform the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Bartonella to date. This analysis included estimation of divergence dates using a molecular clock and ancestral reconstruction of host associations and geography. We estimate that Bartonella began infecting mammals 62 million years ago near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Additionally, the radiation of particular Bartonella clades correlate strongly to the timing of diversification and biogeography of mammalian hosts. Bats were inferred to be the ancestral hosts of all mammal-associated Bartonella and appear to be responsible for the early geographic expansion of the genus. We conclude that bats have had a deep influence on the evolutionary radiation of Bartonella bacteria and their spread to other mammalian orders. These results support a 'bat seeding' hypothesis that could explain similar evolutionary patterns in other mammalian parasite taxa. Application of such phylogenetic tools as we have used to other taxa may reveal the general importance of bats in the ancient diversification of mammalian parasites. Discovering the evolutionary history of infectious agents in animals is important for understanding the process of host adaptation and the origins of human diseases. To clarify the evolution of the Bartonella genus, which contains important human pathogens, we performed phylogenetic analysis on a broad diversity of Bartonella strains, including novel strains from bats. Our results indicate that Bartonella clades diversified along with their mammal hosts over millions of years. Bats appear to be especially important in the early radiation and geographic dispersal of Bartonella lineages. These patterns are consistent with research indicating a chiropteran origin of important human viruses and eukaryotic parasites, suggesting that bats may play a unique role as historical sources of infections to other hosts.
c0399922a636e04aa6b5ffe2989e4d147ccd5626	To gain insight into the mechanism of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) S-layer protein antiviral activity, we examined how S-layer protein impacts porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and PEDV-induced apoptosis of Vero cells. Pretreatment (exclusion assay), coincubation (competition assay), and post-treatment (displacement assay) of PEDV-infected Vero cells with the S-layer protein was examined. Interestingly, significant inhibition of PEDV by S-layer protein was only observed in the exclusion assay. In Vero cells infected with PEDV, we found that apoptosis was mediated by activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in the late stage of infection. When PEDV-infected Vero cells were pretreated with S-layer protein, rates of Vero cell apoptosis were markedly decreased and cell damage was significantly reduced, as evaluated by flow cytometry and microscopy. Detailed analyses showed that the S-layer protein inhibited caspase-8 and caspase-3 activity. Taken together, our results suggest that L. acidophilus S-layer protein plays an inhibitory role during PEDV infection of Vero cells, and that the antagonistic activity of the protein is not via competition with PEDV for binding sites. In addition, the findings suggest that L. acidophilus S-layer protein protects against PEDV-induced apoptosis through reduced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation in the later stages of infection. This mechanism may represent a novel approach for antagonizing PEDV and other viruses.
ee920d9fbd665ab4530646653d2ca966f109e333	We have recently described the cloning of a portion of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and confirmed its etiologic association with enterically transmitted (waterborne, epidemic) non-A, non-B hepatitis. The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the 5' end and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 bp downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 bp from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the 5' end encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27-34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family. o tsst Academic PWSS, IIX.
cd1c759c0e01574aecb3c80253b7670a11b47ba2	How does social distancing affect the reach of an epidemic in social networks? We present Monte Carlo simulation results of a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model on a network, where individuals are limited in the number of other people they can interact with. While increased social distancing always reduces the spread of an infectious disease, the magnitude varies greatly depending on the topology of the social network. Our results also reveal the importance of coordination at the 'global' level. In particular, the public health benefits from social distancing to a group (e.g., a country) may be completely undone if that group maintains connections with outside groups that are not social distancing. *
3ca9e8f49a7bf19e7b79bef7c0e34bd63aa4116b	Background: This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident training and education at Danbury Hospital. We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents' usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.
d9a250e71464fd6d580fd68d143402131e47ae6e	J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights  SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure until death.  Myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmias thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are the main complications in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities.  SARSCoV-2 can worsen the clinical status of patients with comorbidities especially preexisting cardiovascular diseases and this may interfere with therapies. A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with cardiovascular and multiple organ failure till death. The main mechanisms of virus internalization and interaction with the host are down-regulation or upregulation of the ACE2 receptor, the surface glycoprotein competition mechanism for the binding of porphyrin to iron in heme formation as well as interference with the immune system. The interference on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, heme formation, and the immune response is responsible for infection diffusion, endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, oxidative damage and releasing of inflammatory mediators. The main pathological findings are bilateral interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Because ACE receptor is also present in the endothelium of other districts as well as in different cell types, and as porphyrins are transporters in the blood and other biological liquids of iron forming heme, which is important in the assembly of the hemoglobin, myoglobin and the cytochromes, multiorgan damage occurs both primitive and secondary to lung damage. More relevantly, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, and disseminated intravasal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f

The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently. Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 nonsynonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Based on our findings, potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation.

e9c1b8e260f20d49172aef5873c4452a219b699c	Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion system has been shown to be efficient for enhancing expression and preventing degradation of the target protein. We showed herein that SUMO fusion to human keratinocyte growth factor 2 (hKGF-2) gene was feasible and it significantly enhanced protein expression and its efficiency. The fusion DNA fragment composed of SUMO gene, which was fused to hexahistidine tag, and hKGF-2 gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into the expression vector pET28a to construct the recombinant plasmid, pET28a-SUMO-hKGF-2. The plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta TM 2(DE3), and the recombinant fusion protein SUMO-hKGF-2 was expressed at 30°C for 6 h, with the induction of IPTG at the final concentration of 0.4 mM. The expression level of the fusion protein was up to 30% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. After desalting by Sephadex G-25 size exclusion chromatography, the hexahistidine-SUMO-hKGF-2 was digested by SUMO proteases. The recombinant hKGF-2 was purified again with Ni-NTA column and the purity was about 95% with a total yield of 13.9 mg/l culture. The result of mitogenicity assay suggests that the recombinant hKGF-2 can significantly promote the proliferation of normal rat kidney epithelial (NRK-52E) cells. Keywords Human keratinocyte growth factor 2 Á Small ubiquitin-related modifier Á Fusion protein Á Expression and purification Á Mitogenic activity Xiaoping Wu, and Changjun Nie contributed equally to the work.
fdeb2a83ccf3440b32f6aeba0aa317393216c8e8	We and others have previously investigated the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) on early acute and late chronic demyelinating disease induced by Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV). Infection of susceptible SJL mice with this virus serves as an excellent model of virusinduced demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). iNOS transcripts and protein were detected in brains and spinal cords of TMEVinfected SJL mice during early acute disease, which resembles polioencephalomyelitis. Similar level of expression of iNOS has been found in resistant B6 mice, which develop only early acute disease. Weak iNOS staining was detected in reactive astrocytes and in leptomeningeal infiltrates in TMEV-infected SJL mice at 42 days post infection (p.i.), corresponding to early phase of chronic demyelinating disease, but not at 66 and 180 days p.i. corresponding to advanced and terminal stages of the disease, respectively. Results from other laboratories demonstrated that, blocking of NO by treatment of TMEV-infected SJL mice with amino guanidine (AG), a specific inhibitor of NO resulted in delay of late chronic demyelinating disease. However this protective effect of NO inhibitor depended on the temporal phase of the disease, type of cells expressing iNOS and the time of administration of AG. The results from our laboratory suggests that NO expressed during early acute disease is beneficial to the host through induction of apoptosis of infiltrating T cells and resolution of encephalitis, but its role in myelin/oligodendrocytes damage during late chronic demyelinating disease is not clear and it may depend on availability of superoxide and formation of peroxynitrite.
62cce6483896bf25635e951520ff3637a66c8c23	The COVID-19 pandemic triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health disaster. Main protease is an attractive drug target among coronaviruses, due to its vital role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. There is presently no exact drug or treatment for this diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we report the potential inhibitory activity of some FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main protease by molecular docking study to investigate their binding affinity in protease active site. Docking studies revealed that drug Oseltamivir (anti-H1N1 drug), Rifampin (anti-TB drug), Maraviroc, Etravirine, Indinavir, Rilpivirine (anti-HIV drugs) and Atovaquone, Quinidine, Halofantrine, Amodiaquine, Tetracylcine, Azithromycin, hydroxycholoroquine (anti-malarial drugs) among others binds in the active site of the protease with similar or higher affinity. However, the in-silico abilities of the drug molecules tested in this study, further needs to be validated by carrying out in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, this study spreads the potential use of current drugs to be considered and used to comprise the fast expanding SARS-CoV-2 infection.
d653d9860ec8395a6d1b7f6369c51b8e63dfe214	Aim of the study: Herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and -2) are important pathogens for humans and the discovery of novel anti-HSV drugs with low toxicity deserves great efforts. Rhubarb is one of the oldest and best-known traditional Chinese medicines. We initiated this study to test if emodin is the active ingredients from Rheum tanguticum (R. tanguticum, one of the Chinese Rhubarb) against HSV infection and to investigate its antiviral activity on HSV infection in tissue culture cells and in a mouse model. Materials and methods: Emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) was extracted and purified from R. tanguticum (cultivated at high mountainous area in Qinghai) and the purity was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The antiviral experiments of emodin against HSV infection were performed in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, the HSV-infected mice were orally administered with emodin beginning at 24 h post-HSV exposures with dosages of 3.3 g/kg/day, 6.7 g/kg/day, and 11.3 g/kg/day, respectively, for 7 days. Results: Emodin was found to inhibit the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cell culture at the concentration of 50 g/ml with antiviral index of 2.07 and 3.53, respectively. The emodin treatment increased the survival rate of HSV-infected mice, prolonged survival time and showed higher efficacy of HSV elimination from brain, heart, liver and ganglion, compared to the viral controls. In addition, the antiviral activity of emodin was found to be equivalent to that of acyclovir in vivo. Conclusions: Our results indicate that emodin has the anti-HSV activity in vitro and in vivo and is thus a promising agent in the clinical therapy of HSV infection.
d93d96829d593654a258abcb1bea0851038427aa	This paper addresses the subject of Movie Recommendation Systems, focusing on two of the most well-known filtering techniques, Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering. The first approach proposes a supervised probabilistic Bayesian model that forms recommendations based on the previous evaluations of other movies the user has watched. The second approach composes an unsupervised learning technique that forms clusters of users, using the K-Means algorithm, based on their preference of different movie genres, as it is expressed through their ratings. Both of the above approaches are compared to each other as well as to a basic method known as Weighted Sum, which makes predictions based on the cosine similarity and the euclidean distance between users and movies. In addition, Content-based Filtering is implemented through K-Means clustering techniques that focus on identifying the resemblance between movie plots. The first approach clusters movies according to the Tf/Idf weighting scheme, applying weights to the terms of movie plots. The latter identifies the likeness between movie plots, utilizing the BM25 algorithm. The efficiency of the above methods is calculated through the Accuracy metric.
e0b9e787564d9acd42c03f0e0115dc9d58e508b3	Niclosamide is an oral antihelminthic drug used to treat parasitic infections in millions of people worldwide. However recent studies have indicated that niclosamide may have broad clinical applications for the treatment of diseases other than those caused by parasites. These diseases and symptoms may include cancer, bacterial and viral infection, metabolic diseases such as Type II diabetes, NASH and NAFLD, artery constriction, endometriosis, neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, sclerodermatous graft-versus-host disease, and systemic sclerosis. Among the underlying mechanisms associated with the drug actions of niclosamide are uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and modulation of Wnt/β-catenin, mTORC1, STAT3, NF-κB and Notch signaling pathways. Here we provide a brief overview of the biological activities of niclosamide, its potential clinical applications, and its challenges for use as a new therapy for systemic diseases.
db987742f029e0ff2ef3e88aa7c9b13ea6c3612b	Olfactory disorders are common in "nasal inflammation" even though the term is comprehensive and subsumes different kinds of entities which have to be differentiated. The most common cause of olfactory disorders are sinonasal disorders, which are defined as secondary smell disorders caused by diseases/pathologies in the nose/paranasal sinuses. According to the literature, sinonasal disorders represent-depending on the examined population-up to 72% of all olfactory disorders. In general, noninflammatory and inflammatory disorders are differentiated. Inflammatory disorders can be further classified into infectious or noninfectious disorders, both forms in which olfactory disorders can be present. For the clinician examining patients, the exact classification of the olfactory disorder is mandatory in order to choose appropriate treatment and counseling. Among the most common inflammatory disorders are acute rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, post-upper respiratory tract infection and chronic rhinosinusitis, which are discussed in detail. In contrast to nasal inflammation, only little is known about oral inflammation and its psychophysical effects on taste function. Taste disorders following oral inflammation are briefly discussed.

The droplet/particle-vapor interaction, i.e., 4 the evaporation or condensation of the multi-component droplet/particle, is one of the 5 key mechanisms that need to be precisely modeled. Using a validated computational 6 model, the transport, evaporation, hygroscopic growth, and deposition of 7 multi-component droplets were simulated in a simplified airway geometry. A 8 mucus-tissue layer is explicitly modeled in the airway geometry to describe mucus 9 evaporation and heat transfer. Pulmonary flow and aerosol dynamics patterns associated 10 with different inhalation flow rates are visualized and compared. Investigated variables 11 include temperature distributions, relative humidity (RH) distributions, deposition 12 efficiencies, droplet/particle distributions, and droplet growth ratio distributions. Numerical results indicate that the droplet/particle-vapor interaction and the heat and 14 mass transfer of the mucus-tissue layer must be considered in the computational lung 15 aerosol dynamics study, since they can significantly influence the precise predictions of 16 the aerosol transport and deposition. Furthermore, the modeling framework in this study 17 is ready to be expanded to predict transport dynamics of cough/sneeze droplets starting 18 from their generation and transmission in the indoor environment to the deposition in 19 the human respiratory system. The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises public health 2 concern internationally. It has been confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can spread between 3 humans via contacting droplets expelled from coughing or sneezing. Details on the 4 transmission routes remain unknown, i.e., how SARS-CoV-2 can transmit within the 5 embedded droplets/particles in the air and human respiratory systems? To answer the 6 question, one of the key mechanisms that need to be addressed is the 7 droplet/particle-vapor interaction. 8 The droplet/particle-vapor interaction, i.e., the evaporation and condensation, is 9 critical for predicting the behavior of the droplet/particle in air. The water content of the 10 atmospheric droplets is strongly dependent on the droplet composition and 11 environmental relative humidity (RH) (Pilinis et al., 1989). The primary chemical 12 components in the PM 2.5 and PM 10 contain sea salt, ammonium, sulfate, nitrate (Ho et 13 al., 2003; X. Wang et al., 2006). These components are hydrophilic and can absorb 14 water vapor under high ambient relative humidity (RH). 15 For the indoor environment, such droplet/particle-vapor interaction has attracted 16 attention when researchers attempted to model the droplets/particles transport dynamics 17 generated from different sources. For example, Wang et al. (2019) recently simulated 18 the evaporation of large droplets (20-80 μm) in a simplified 2D industrial building with 19 different ambient temperature and RH conditions. Water droplets were employed to 20 represent the industrial airborne pollutants in the form of droplets. Furthermore, Yang et 21 To quantitatively measure the bio-aerosol transmission, accurate prediction for the 1 deposition of inhaled droplets/particles is essential. Deposition of inhalable 2 droplets/particles is commonly dominated by three mechanisms, i.e., inertial impaction 3 (Kim & Fisher, 1999), sedimentation (Chen, Feng, et al., 2018; Kleinstreuer et al., 4 2007), and diffusion (Zamankhan et al., 2006). Diffusion, i.e., Brownian motion, has a 5 limited effect on micron droplets/particles (Clement Kleinstreuer et al., 2008). The 6 hygroscopic growth of the droplet/particle increases the diameter and mass of the 7 droplet/particle. Therefore, it may further affect the droplet/particle deposition via these 8 three deposition mechanisms. The hygroscopic growth of the droplet/particle is determined by the water vapor 10 concentration distribution in the airway. However, the water vapor concentration 11 distribution is not only determined by RHs in the ambient air, but also influenced by the 12 evaporation rate of the mucus layer that covers the airway. Wu et al. (2014) proposed a 13 numerical method using two domains, i.e., a mucus-tissue layer and an airway lumen 14 domain, to predict the temperature and RH distributions in the airway. We recently 15 developed a similar method for predicting the deposition of hygroscopic droplets in a 16 mouth-throat (MT) airway geometry with an inhalation flow rate equal to 15 L/min 17 (Chen, Kleinstreuer, et al., 2018). The numerical predictions suggested that inhaled 18 thermal airflow and mucus-layer interaction could significantly reduce hygroscopic 19 growth, and thereby decrease the deposition efficiency (DE) of multi-component 20 droplets up to 10% compared to the DE, using the constant 37 °C and 99.5 % RH as the 21 3 . Numerical investigation of 9 the interaction, transport and deposition of multicomponent droplets in a 10 simple mouth-throat model.
6b182c2854786d165bb581cbfd77866012ff64cb	Wenzhou virus (WENV) was first identified in rodents and Asian house shrews in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, China. However, little is known about the prevalence of WENV infections in humans in China. To determine the threat that WENV may pose to humans, we determine the seroprevalence of WENV in healthy individuals in China in this study. Cross-reactivities of nucleoprotein (NP) were detected between Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and WENV using Western blot and ELISA assy. The prevalence of specific IgG antibodies against WENV NP was investigated in different age groups of 830 healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in China using a competition ELISA assay. The results indicate that WENV and LCMV share cross-reactive epitopes between NPs. The total seroprevalence of WENV in healthy adults was 4.6%, with 3.6% (8/221) for individuals 15-44 years of age, 5.4% (17/317) for individuals 45-59 years of age, and 4.1% (4/98) for older adults over 60. The total seroprevalence of WENV in children under age 15 was 1.5%, with 2.9% (1/34) in children aged 2-5 years, and 2.2% in 5-14 years (2/91). The finding suggests that WENV or WENV-like virus may sporadically infect humans of China. Lujo [7], Chapare [8] viruses can result in severe hemorrhagic fever. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is known to cause acute central nervous system disease and congenital malformations [9]. However, only two mammarenaviruses have been conclusively found in Asia: LCMV and WENV [1, 10]. The diagnoses of LCMV are subject to methodological shortcomings, specificity and sensitivity of assays used [11]. Thus, LCMV may be more Journal Pre-proof Serum specimens were collected from 830 healthy individuals from birth to 70 years old in Beijing and in Shandong Province, China during regular health check-ups. Subjects who were pregnant or who had any abnormalities in renal and liver function tests, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, tumor, recurrent or acute infection, or medication were excluded. All serum samples Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f were stored at -80°C prior to use. This study was approved by the ethical review committee of the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Full-length NP genes from WENV (1704 bp, GenBank accession no. KM051422) and LCMV (1677 bp, GenBank accession no. DQ286931) were synthesized by Beijing Tsingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). System (Invitrogen) and were purified as previously described [13, 14] . Mice were inoculated with the recombinant antigens from E. coli to produce antisera against WENV and LCMV NP. The antigen cross-reactivities between WENV and LCMV were performed between the purified NPs from Baculovirus Expression System and the sera against WENV and LCMV NP using Western blot assay [13]. Western blot analysis System were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall, Port Washington, NY, USA). Mice sera against NPs of WENV and LCMV, or healthy human sera were applied for Western blot assay, followed by incubation with corresponding goat anti-mouse or human IRDye Fluor 800-labeled IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000) (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Membranes were scanned by an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Li-Cor). ELISA was used to detect the anti-WENV NP antibodies in human serum samples as described elsewhere [12] . The amount of coating proteins (purified WENV NP) and sera dilution was optimized by a chessboard titration protocol. The absorbance of each serum sample was read at 450 nm (A450) and mean values were calculated for duplicate samples. To overcome antigen cross-reactivity between WENV and LCMV NPs, competitive ELISA (cELISA) was performed as described previously [15] . Antibodies in human serum samples were absorbed with LCMV NP prior to performing the ELISA assay. For this purpose, serially diluted LCMV NP (16 μg/mL to 0.5 μg/mL) was added to a 1:400 dilution of human sera and incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C. Seropositive rates were evaluated using χ 2 tests. Two-sided P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results To evaluate the potential cross-reactivities, we examined the reactivity between the NPs of WENV and LCMV derived from baculovirus expression In summary, the seroprevalence data in this study indicate that WENV or WENV-like viruses can jump the species barrier to infect the human population sporadically. However, WENV or WENV-like virus may be associated with undiagnosed human infectious diseases warrants further studies.

ac0ed4e3ae92a0e194ea6808c289a0b6224ea054	Control strategies enforced by health agencies are a major type of practice to contain influenza outbreaks. Another type of practice is the voluntary preventive behavior of individuals, such as receiving vaccination, taking antiviral drugs, and wearing face masks. These two types of practices take effects concurrently in influenza containment, but little attention has been paid to their combined effectiveness. This article estimates this combined effectiveness using established simulation models in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, USA. Three control strategies are investigated, including: Targeted Antiviral Prophylaxis (TAP), workplace/school closure, community travel restriction, as well as the combination of the three. All control strategies are simulated with and without regard to individual preventive behavior, and the resulting effectiveness are compared. The simulation outcomes suggest that weaker control strategies could suffice to contain influenza epidemics, because individuals voluntarily adopt preventive behavior, rendering these weaker strategies more effective than would otherwise have been expected. The preventive behavior of individuals could save medical resources for control strategies and avoid unnecessary socio-economic interruptions. This research adds a human behavioral dimension into the simulation of control strategies and offers new insights into disease containment. Health policy makers are recommended to review current control strategies and comprehend preventive behavior patterns of local populations before making decisions on influenza containment.
375aabb4ab6c85f7318e7654649b74813a2ea0e1	The intrathecal humoral immune response was analysed in patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and Lewis rats with subacute measles virus (MV)-induced encephalomyelitis (SAME). SSPE patients as well as SAME rats revealed oligoclonal, intrathecal antibody synthesis with MV specificity. SAME rats synthesized MV-specific antibodies intracerebrally to a higher extent than SSPE patients. Although a restricted isoelectric pattern of MV-specific antibodies was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SSPE patients as well as of SAME rats, the heterogeneity within clusters of immunogiobulin bands was higher in the rat specimens. Increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability for albumin was exclusively detected in SAME rats but not in SSPE patients. These data suggest that the rat model offers excellent opportunities to study the initial humoral events in MV-induced encephalitides.
b0cfe37e539ff3d2534d098467d91a1d995f83d9	Background: There is indirect evidence that an increased infectious burden is associated with a decreased prevalence of IgE-mediated allergy during childhood. Objective: To determine whether there is a relation between the serostatus of 13 different viruses and parentally reported infections and IgE sensitization in 2-year-old children. To investigate whether there is an interaction between cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in relation to IgE sensitization. Methods: A total of 246 infants were followed prospectively to 2 years of age with clinical examinations, skin prick test, and specific IgE analyses and through analysis of seropositivity against adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, CMV, EBV, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus 6, and varicella-zoster virus. Results: There was some evidence that IgE sensitization (24%) tended to be more common among children who were seropositive against few compared with children who were seropositive against many viruses, but this was not statistically significant, and there was no consistent trend across the groups. IgE sensitization was statistically significantly less prevalent at 2 years of age among infants who were seropositive against EBV but not other viruses (adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14-0.86). The interaction of seropositivity against both CMV and EBV antibodies indicated a further reduction in the risk for IgE sensitization (adjusted odds ratio for interaction, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.92), indicating effect modification associated with seropositivity against CMV. Conclusion: Our results indicate that acquisition of EBV infection during the first 2 years of life is associated with a reduced risk of IgE sensitization, and this effect is enhanced by CMV coinfection.

7506859560efebc4640e77683b549c2c5097acfd	Traditional Chinese exercise (TCE) has gradually become one of the widespread complementary therapies for treatment and recovery of cancers. However, evidence based on the systematic evaluation of its efficacy is lacking, and there appears to be no conclusion regarding the setting of TCE interventions. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that outline the effects of TCE on cancer patients. Relevant studies were searched by GOOGLE SCHOLAR, SCIENCEDIRECT, and WEB OF SCIENCE using "traditional Chinese exercise" and "cancer." Only RCTs published in peer-reviewed English journals were included. A total of 27 studies covering 1616 cancer patients satisfied the eligibility criteria for this review. Despite the methodological limitation and relatively high risk of bias possessed by some included studies, positive evidence was still detected on the effects of TCE on these cancer-related health outcomes in physical, psychological, and physiological parameters. The 60-min or 90-min course of TCE intervention for two to three times per week for 10 to 12 weeks was found to be the most common setting in these studies and has effectively benefited cancer patients. These findings add scientific support to encourage cancer patients to practice TCE during or after conventional medical treatment. Nevertheless, future well-designed RCTs with improved methodology and larger sample size on this field are much warranted for further verification.
48ca27e787305ffee0a703bbcf9a4f058e1e7157	Biosensors have witnessed an escalating interest nowadays, both in the research and commercial fields. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) biosensors (genosensors) have been exploited for their inherent physicochemical stability and suitability to discriminate different organism strains. The main principle of detection among genosensors relies on specific DNA hybridization, directly on the surface of a physical transducer. This review covers the main DNA immobilization techniques reported so far, new microand nanotechnological platforms for biosensing and the transduction mechanisms in genosensors. Clinical applications, in particular, demand large-scale and decentralized DNA testing. New schemes for DNA diagnosis include DNA chips and microfluidics, which couples DNA detection with sample pretreatment under in vivo-like hybridization conditions. Higher sensitivity and specificity may arise from nanoengineered structures, like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and DNA/protein conjugates. A new platform for universal DNA biosensing is also presented, and its implications for the future of molecular diagnosis are argued.
a07819f279cf7c777e717339c3aef1ce509f8c07	Our prospective study was therefore designed to determine which part of the systemic inflammatory response after cardiac operations resulted from Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in neonates and infants. After approval by the human ethical committee of the Gunma Children's Medical Center (GCMC) and informed consent of the parents, 40 consecutive term congenital heart disease patients aged until 1 year who underwent long CPB time (> 3 h) at surgery were included in the prospective study between January 2012 and December 2014. C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) drug (@Berinert) was generously provided by CSL Behring (King of Prussia, PA). The C1-inh (20 IU/kg) was given intravenously 60 min after CPB. Blood samples for complement factors were obtained before and 48 h after administration of C1-inh. Six patients did not survive and their data were not included. Of 34 patients included, median age was 6.5 months, median body weight was 6050 g, and 16 (47%) were female. According to the Mann-Whitney U test, there were no differences between the two groups concerning demographic and intraoperative data, postoperative chemical data. C1q concentration was only significant lower in patients with C1-inh non-treated group than in patients with C1-inh treated group. But, the consumption of C1q, C3, C4, CH 50 , and C1-inh in patients with C1-inhibitor non-treated group was observed early postoperatively. There is a significant difference in the values before and after C1-inh treatment between the two groups. The lower value in the C1-inh-treated group is explained by the activation of the classical pathway through the replenishment of complements by C1-inh treatment. This study proposes the administration of C1-inh is an effective therapy to reduce the activation and improve the clinical capillary leak syndrome.

ae5c80ddeff7b8740c2557b2a584315ff5e233f8	In Africa, rural people depend heavily, if not exclusively, on medicinal plants and indigenous healthcare knowledge to meet their medical needs. Over 80000 fl owering plant species are used medicinally worldwide. Amongst them are the underutilized Ziziphus species in the Rhamnaceae family. In terms of abundance and economic value, Z. jujuba and Z. mauritiana are currently the most important, especially in China and India where they are cultivated and exploited for medicinal use and their edible fruits. We examined a related common species widely distributed in Africa, Z. mucronata, whose economic value has not, as yet, been explored. Local people in various African countries use its different parts to cure a large number of diseases, many of which are similar to those treated with Z. jujuba and Z. mauritiana. Several studies have shown that Z. mucronata has cyclopeptide alkaloids, i.e., mucronines F, G and H, with antibacterial properties. Conservation strategies to sustain and maximize the benefi ts of Z. mucronata to people are proposed.
0b30e970d817fdc264c7e6f61eda62e29775e650	Coronaviruses (CoVs) produce a wide spectrum of disease syndromes in different mammalian and avian host species. These viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations. It is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences. Several CoVs (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans and in other ruminant species. Biologic, antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called 'bovine-like CoVs' proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, the different bovine-like CoVs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes and wild goats) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 ABSTRACT A novel magnetic/plasmonic-assisted fluoro-immunoassay system is developed for the detection of influenza virus using magnetic-derivatized plasmonic molybdenum trioxide quantum dots (MP-MoO 3 QDs) as the plasmonic/magnetic agent and fluorescent graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (gCNQDs) as the monitoring probe. Specific antibody against influenza A virus was conjugated onto the surface of MP-MoO 3 QDs and gCNQDs, respectively. In the presence of influenza A virus (as the test virus), a core-satellite immunocomplex is formed between the antibody-conjugated nanomaterials (Ab-MP-MoO 3 QDs and Ab-gCNQDs) and their interaction resulted in the modulation and gradual enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of the detection probe with the influenza virus concentration-dependent increase. In addition, PL change without influenza A virus was not observed. Limits of detection of 0.25 and 0.9 pg/mL were achieved for Influenza virus A/New Caledonia (20/99/IVR/116) (H1N1) detection in deionized water and human serum, respectively. Clinically isolated influenza virus A/Yokohama (110/2009) (H3N2) was detected in the range of 45 -25,000 PFU/mL, with a limit of detection ca 45 PFU/mL (as opposed to a minimum of 5000 PFU/mL for a commercial test kit). This developed biosensor provides a robust, sensitive as well as a selective platform for influenza virus detection.

2ae81644d62af97d80322750eaf154c025fe3ac8	The crisis caused by COVID-19 revealed the global unpreparedness to handle the impact of a pandemic. In this paper, we present a statistical analysis of the data related to the COVID-19 outbreak in China, specifically the infection speed, death and fatality rates in Hubei province. By fitting distributions of these quantities we design a parametric reinsurance contract whose trigger and cap are based on the probability distributions of the infection speed, death and fatality rates. In particular, fitting the distribution for the infection speed and death rates we provide a measure of the effectiveness of a state's action during an epidemic, and propose a reinsurance contract as a supplement to a state's social insurance to alleviate financial costs.
a0a80e5ace4b5fa116759dc0f5d0fda4b4a8dd54	Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are increasingly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission. Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second. In a closed, stagnant air environment, they disappear from the window of view with time constants in the range of 8 to 14 min, which corresponds to droplet nuclei of ca. 4 μm diameter, or 12-to 21-μm droplets prior to dehydration. These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments.

ab54f13666ed771c15684d73ff6bcc7c92b8ae05	Background: The common cold questionnaire (CCQ) is used to discriminate those with and without a viral infection. Its usefulness in people with acute asthma is unknown. Our aim was to assess the ability of the CCQ to detect viral infection and to monitor recovery during a viral induced asthma exacerbation and confirmed by virological testing. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied subjects ($7 yrs) admitted to hospital with acute asthma and diagnosed as positive (n = 63), or negative to viral infection (n = 27) according to molecular and virological testing from respiratory samples. CCQ, asthma history and asthma control questionnaires were completed and repeated 4-6 weeks later. Sensitivity, specificity, and response to change of the CCQ were assessed by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis and effect size calculation respectively. The CCQ did not discriminate between viral and non-viral infection for subjects with asthma (sensitivity = 76.2%; specificity = 29.6%). ROC analysis could not differentiate between positive or negative virus in subjects with asthma. The CCQ had a large response to change following recovery (effect size = 1.01). 39% of subjects recovering from viral exacerbation remained positive to virological testing at follow-up despite improvement in clinical symptoms. The CCQ reflected clinical improvement in these subjects, thus providing additional information to complement virological testing. Conclusions/Significance: The CCQ is a useful instrument for monitoring response to viral infection in people with asthma. Reliable differentiation between viral and non-viral asthma exacerbations was not achieved with the CCQ and requires specific virological testing. When combined with virological testing, the CCQ should be a useful outcome measure for evaluating therapies in viral-induced asthma.

We report a case of pregnant woman with COVID-19 pneumonia in the second trimester. Clinical and imaging features of the patient were similar to that reported in the literatures for both perinatal patients and non-pregnant patients.
d9a5c2faf2fed55a9f69ffc63f5a6237d34d3a2a	A prospective randomized phase III study was performed to evaluate whether intensified cytarabine would induce a higher response rate and longer event-free interval as compared to low-dose cytarabine in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). One hundred and eighteen patients with CML in early chronic phase entered the study. Twenty-eight out of 32 patients assigned to group A received two cycles of a combination of intensified cytarabine and idarubicin followed by interferon alfa (IFN-α) maintenance, 28 patients in group B received standard treatment by a combination of low-dose cytarabine and IFN-α. Forty-nine patients with a human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling donor proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and nine patients were excluded from the analysis. Hematological response was observed in 97% of the patients in group A vs 86% of the patients in group B during the first year of treatment. In group A, 16 patients (50%) achieved a major cytogenetic response, which compared to seven patients (25%) with a major cytogenetic response in group B. With a median follow-up of 58 months (range 34-76), event-free survival was not significantly different between arms A and B. The estimated 5-year survival rate was 56% in the intensified arm and 77% in the low-dose arm (P=0.05). Recipients of allo-SCT showed a 5-year estimated survival rate of 55%. Although intensified cytarabine induced a higher initial percentage of major and complete cytogenetic responses, responses were not sustained by IFN-α maintenance therapy.
4d69cb1dd202569b16047de0d8ef3b7ac3b76310	Background: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has a significant impact on public health throughout Asia, and there is a pressing need for development of new therapeutics against it. Methods: Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) are antisense agents that enter cells readily and interfere with gene expression. Four PPMOs, targeting various locations in the JEV genome, were evaluated for antiviral activity against JEV in cultured cells and the mouse model of JEV infection. Results: A PPMO (P10882) targeting the JEV 3 ′ cyclization sequence (3 ′ CSI) had significant antiviral activity in Vero (epithelial), Neuro2A (neuronal) and J774E (macrophage) cells at concentrations that were not cytotoxic. P10882 added before infection suppressed JEV replication to an undetectable level in Vero cells and produced a 93% and 66% reduction in titre in J774E and Neuro2A cells, respectively, when measured at 24 h postinfection. In uninfected cells, fluorescein-labelled PPMOs entered J774E cells most efficiently, followed by Vero and Neuro2A cells. The antiviral effect of P10882 was also demonstrated in vivo, where 60% -80% of 1-week-old mice treated intracerebrally with a 20 mg/kg dose of P10882 every 12 h for 5 days were protected from a lethal dose of JEV and showed an undetectable level of virus in brain tissue at 2 days post-infection. Conclusions: P10882, which targets sequence that is highly conserved across members of the JEV serocomplex, was previously shown to be effective in a mouse model of West Nile disease, and represents a candidate antiviral agent against members of the JEV serocomplex.
fa06a5397d30bd6c8b268ea86a4458fcebe08fa9	To compare clinical and imaging features between patients with an initial negative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test and patients with an initial positive RT-PCR test. CT follow-up analysis in the negative RT-PCR group is also described. Thirty-three patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR, with 216 lesions upon CT, were included. Demographic information and chest CT imaging features were collected. The average age in the whole study group was 46.9 ± 11.1 years, with 18 males and 15 females. Patients in the positive RT-PCR test group were more likely to have a fever than patients in the negative RT-PCR test group (85.7% vs 50%, P < .05). Lesions in the positive group were more likely to be located in the peripheral area than lesions in the negative group (83.6% vs 68.2%, P < .05). Regarding the appearance of 216 lesions, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with consolidation (43.2%) was the most common appearance in the negative group, followed by pure GGOs (31.8%), while in the positive group, pure GGOs (32%) and GGOs with interlobular septal thickening (32.8%) were both most frequent, and the difference between them was evident (P < .05). For the follow-up analysis, the largest short-axis of a lesion was smaller upon follow-up (median size 13.6 mm vs 14 mm), albeit by a smaller margin. Pure GGOs decreased in frequency, from 31.3% to 21.3%, while consolidation increased in frequency, from 7.5% to 12.5%. The manifestations of COVID-19 in patients with a first negative RT-PCR test and patients with a positive first RT-PCR test are different to some extent. The consolidation component may increase after follow-up. Abbreviations: GGO = ground-glass opacity, MERS-CoV = Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, RT-PCR = reversetranscription-polymerase chain-reaction, SARS-CoV = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
360991ff283a6ec08b264813dba65427cecfa615	Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are now known to be the vertebrate animal reservoir that intermittently transmits the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to humans. Yet, details as to the specific mechanism(s) of zoonotic transmission from dromedaries to humans remain unclear. The aim of this study was to describe direct and indirect contact with dromedaries among all cases, and then separately for primary, non-primary, and unclassified cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) between 1 January 2015 and 13 April 2018. We present any reported dromedary contact: direct, indirect, and type of indirect contact. Of all 1125 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO during the time period, there were 348 (30.9%) primary cases, 455 (40.4%) non-primary cases, and 322 (28.6%) unclassified cases. Among primary cases, 191 (54.9%) reported contact with dromedaries: 164 (47.1%) reported direct contact, 155 (44.5%) reported indirect contact. Five (1.1%) non-primary cases also reported contact with dromedaries. Overall, unpasteurized milk was the most frequent type of dromedary product consumed. Among cases for whom exposure was systematically collected and reported to WHO, contact with dromedaries or dromedary products has played an important role in zoonotic transmission. Viruses 2018, 10, 425 2 of 10 and associated clusters in other regions of the world. Outbreaks of non-sustained, human-to-human transmission have primarily occurred in healthcare settings [2]. MERS-CoV appears to be transmitted inefficiently between humans through casual contact in the general community [3] . In contrast, limited human-to-human transmission has occurred in healthcare settings from unprotected contact with or inadequate infection prevention and control measures in the care of MERS patients [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Health-care associated outbreaks have, on occasion, resulted in large outbreaks with significant public health and economic consequences, and health-care associated infections account for approximately half of the MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO to date. There have been significant improvements in implementation of adequate and specific infection prevention and control measures during healthcare outbreaks and these efforts have been shown to reduce human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings [11] . Despite this, substantial work remains to understand and prevent MERS-CoV from entering the human population and thus reducing the potential for amplified transmission in healthcare settings. There is now strong consensus that dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are the main source of transmission of MERS-CoV to humans. Despite MERS-CoV causing little to no disease in dromedaries, MERS-CoV can circulate within and between dromedary herds, and from dromedaries to humans [12] . MERS-CoV RNA has been detected, and viable virus has been isolated from dromedaries, including partial MERS-CoV genome sequences [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Analysis of outbreaks associated with a barn in KSA [21] [22] [23] and in Qatar [17, 24] inferred animal-to-human transmission following parallel dromedary and human infections with nearly identical strains of MERS-CoV. Field surveys have been conducted on several domestic and wildlife species, including dromedary and Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus),
4bb93bc95443923a40b9ab90a41f1ca150b335e8	Background: Babesia spp. are hemoparasites which infect the red blood cells of a large variety of mammals. In bats, the only known species of the genus is Babesia vesperuginis. However, except a few old reports, the host range and geographical distribution of this bat parasite have been poorly studied. This study aimed to investigate the presence of piroplasms in tissues of bats collected in four different countries from eastern and central Europe: Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. Methods: A total of 461 bat carcasses (24 species) were collected between 2001 and 2016 from caves, mines and buildings. PCR was performed using specific primers targeting a portion of the 18S rDNA nuclear gene and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene, followed by sequencing. Results: The results of this study show for the first time the presence of B. vesperuginis in bats in central and eastern Europe. The phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rDNA nuclear gene revealed no variability between the sequences and the phylogenetic analysis of the cox1 mitochondrial gene proved that B. vesperuginis could be divided into two subclades. Conclusion: Our study showed a broad geographical distribution of B. vesperuginis in European bats, reporting its presence in five new host species (M. cf. alcathoe, M. bechsteinii, M. myotis, Pi. nathusii and V. murinus) and three new countries.
be6c32a4d351f410d96b2a85713933f1c161809f	Different ways of calculating mortality ratios during epidemics can yield widely different results, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual-and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the length of time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of infected cases to date. Using available data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and simple assumptions, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose a more systematic method to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and errors in the data.
1a80ce2336e72d0e9283afaf12e5d25255f4984e	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV. No antiviral treatment has been established so far. Interferons are cytokines which induce the synthesis of several antivirally active proteins in the cell. In this study, we demonstrated that multiplication of SARS-CoV in cell culture can be strongly inhibited by pretreatment with interferon-beta. Interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma, by contrast, were less effective. The human MxA protein is one of the most prominent proteins induced by interferon-beta. Nevertheless, no interference with SARS-CoV replication was observed in Vero cells stably expressing MxA. Therefore, other interferon-induced proteins must be responsible for the strong inhibitory effect of interferon-beta against SARS-CoV.
07396bda4a37d13aaf15fdf67d61971549f4162c	Background: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the leading cause of children and their leading killer. ARIs are responsible for at least six percent of the world's disability and death. Viruses are one of the most common agents causing ARIs. Few studies on the viral etiology and clinical characteristics of ARIs have been performed in the northwest region of China, including Gansu Province. Methods: Clinical and demographic information and throat swabs were collected from 279 patients from January 1st to December 30st, 2011. Multiplex RT-PCR was performed to detect 16 respiratory viral pathogens. Results: 279 patients were admitted for ARIs. The patients aged from 1 month to 12 years, with the median age of 2 years. Of which, 105 (37.6%) were positive for at least one pathogen. A total of 136 respiratory viral pathogens were identified from the 105 patients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected pathogen (26.5%, 36/136), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-3 (22.1%, 30/136), human rhinovirus (HRV) (21.3%, 29/136), human coronavirus (CoV) (10.3%, 14/136) and human adenovirus (HAdV) (9.6%, 13/136). Influenza A (Flu A), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (BoCA) were found 4.4%, 3.7% and 2.2%, respectively. Influenza B (Flu B) and seasonal influenza A H1N1(sH1N1) were not detected. Single-infections were detected in 30.5% (85/279) of cases. RSV was the most common pathogens in patients under 1 year and showed seasonal variation with peaks during winter and spring. Conclusions: This paper presents data on the epidemiology of viral pathogens associated with ARIs among children in Gansu Province, China. RSV is most frequently detected in our study. The findings could serve as a reference for local CDC in drawing up further plans to prevent and control ARIs.

f2cd813b10fef62df67ce734a5a22168355944e9	Many adenovirus field strains exhibit serological relationship to two different prototypes. Differences were found by SN and HI. Examples are intermediate strains (ISIH9, 171H29; H = Hemagglutinin), doubly neutralizable strains (3+ 161H16, 11 +3SIH3S), or strains cross-reacting in HI with two different types (211H21 +35). The variants were further characterized by DNA restriction analysis using at least seven endonucleases. While the DNA of serologically identical strains showed slight variations, only, the comparison of the variants with the serologically related prototypes resulted in only moderate DNA relationship (50 to 70% comigrating fragments, with few exceptions). It is possible that the serologic variants have originated by recombination of two prototype-like strains. Respective data will be presented for A VlS/H9 intermediate strains. Aim of this investigation was to answer three questions: 1. Prevalence of Delta hepatitis in South-West-Germany? 2. Prevalence of inapparent HDV infection? 3. Is the clinical course of Delta hepatitis different from that of hepatitis B? Material and methods: Six hundred and fifty-three HBsAg pas. and one hundred and fifty-two HBsAg neg.lanti-HBclHIV pos. sera were reinvestigated for anti-Delta IgG and IgM (DELTAK, DELTA-IGMK, SORIN). Data on the clinical course were taken from patients history. Results and discussion: The prevalence of Delta hepatitis is 4.3% (28/653) in HBsAgpos. patients. The prevalence of inapparent HDV infection in HBsAg neg.lanti-HBc pos. drug addicts is 4,6% (71152). From this identical prevalence of HDV infections with apparent and unapparent HBV infections, we conclude, that about every other HDV infection is correlated with clinical hepatitis. Anti-Delta IgM was detected in 22 of the 28 HBsAg/anti-Delta pos. sera as well an in 2 of 7 anti-Delta/anti-HBc pos. sera of HBsAg neg. drug addicts. Autoantibodies were detected in 82% of the patients (23128). All cases, in which liver biopsies were done, demonstrated anti-Delta IgM and autoantibodies. Thus, the detection of anti-Delta IgM and autoantibodies indicates chronic a. H.

Majority guidelines for various types of cancers favored a delay in treatment or a nonsurgical approach wherever feasible. These guidelines are based on a low level of evidence and have significant discordance for the role and timing of surgery, especially in early tumors.

abd80dcf360dafb7c921416daedc2021908c3503	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemics have proven the ability of coronaviruses to cross species barrier and emerge rapidly in humans. Other coronaviruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are also known to cause major disease epidemics in animals wiith huge economic loss. This special issue in Virology Journal aims to highlight the advances and key discoveries in the animal origin, viral evolution, epidemiology, diagnostics and pathogenesis of the emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses in both humans and animals.

d5777b196673ccb29c3b614aacc53c48a35b9524	Background: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is prevalent in children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, but available epidemiological data is limited. Objectives: (1) To develop and validate a real-time PCR method for hMPV diagnosis. (2) To determine the percentage of hMPV in respiratory specimens from the community and its association with outbreaks in our geographic area. (3) To provide epidemiological data in terms of age distribution, seasonality and co-infections. Study design: A real-time PCR assay was designed for detection of hMPV lineages A and B. Prospective testing for hMPV over a 22-month period was then undertaken. Results: The real-time PCR was sensitive and specific for detection of both lineages of hMPV. hMPV was detected in 9.5% (n = 8239) of the specimens and 25% of the outbreaks (n = 100) tested. The hMPV-positive patients ranged in age from 18 days to 99 years with a median age of 24 months. The number of positive samples peaked during the winter months of December, January and February. A high rate of co-infections was noted in the samples tested. Conclusions: hMPV is common in the community and is associated with outbreaks. Including hMPV in routine testing improves etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory infections.
576bad43bf08b1a2d302695f5624a77fdbcaf6d0	was first discovered in 2012. MERS-CoV can infect multiple host species and cause severe diseases in human. We conducted a series of phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses to study the evolution dynamics of MERS-CoV among different host species with genomic data. Our analyses show: 1) 28 potential recombinant sequences were detected and they can be classified into seven potential recombinant types; 2) The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV was under strong positive selection when Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel beta-coronavirus with high pathogenicity, which imposes a serious threat to human health 1 . Substantial evidence has showed that MERS-CoVs have existed in central and east Africa for decades 2,3 , and have many natural hosts including two species of bats (Neoromicia capensis and Vespertilio superans), dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius), and European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) 4-7 . Yet it seemed that human MERS-CoV first isolated in Saudi Arabian in 2012, and then spread among humans worldwide 8 . Studies of prototype human MERS-CoV also suggested that the tMRCA (the time of most recent common ancestor) of human MERS-CoV can be traced back to about 2011 9 . Because the genome sequence of bat MERS-CoV is highly identical to that of human MERS-CoV, it has been indicated that human MERS-CoV might have a bat origin 10 , while there is also some evidence of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission 11,12 . Together, these studies proposed that zoonotic event may play a nontrivial part in MERS-CoV evolution and transmission. Previous studies showed that recombination was common among the members of beta-coronavirus 13,14 . By joining the previously unlinked DNA, recombination event can create new viral strains which may be capable of infecting new hosts and evading host's immuno-responses. The phylogenetic analysis showed that there were two main MERS-CoV clades-clade A and B, and clade B can be further divided into five phylogenetic groups 15 . There is evidence that recombination event had happened between group III and group V 15 . However, whether there was potential recombination event happened between the other groups or among multiple phylogenetic groups remains unclear. The genome of MERS-CoV is over 30,000 nucleotides (nt) in length, which contains seven predicted open reading frames (ORFs) and four structural genes-spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) 16 (supplementary Fig. 1c ). The surface located spike (S) protein of beta-coronaviruses is one of the major determinants in their cross-species transmission because it mediates the virus-receptor recognition and thereby activates viral infection process 17 . Additionally, the receptor binding domain (RBD) on S protein's N-terminal is the key element for beta-coronavirus entering into host cells and the mutations in coronavirus's RBD affects its infection and cross-species capability 18, 19 . For example, the study of the spike protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), another beta-coronavirus with high pathogenicity, revealed four amino
77c5f0ef0ebfca93b618c8522b31d739203ca6ed	We read with great interest the article on adapting childhood cancer services during the COVID-19 pandemic from global pediatric oncology experts. 1,2 The document highlights the six most curable cancers with practical advice for their management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and includes adaptations for low-to middle-income countries (LMICs). While we share the broad consensus outlined here, we faced several unique challenges at our hospital-a large tertiary cancer care center in Mumbai, now at the epicenter of the outbreak in India-compelling us to take several steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, which may be of benefit to others affected similarly in healthcare settings closer to ours. The Government of India declared one of the largest and most complete lockdowns in the world on March 25, 2020, which may have had an impact on slowing the first surge of COVID-19. Well before this, our center anticipated a potential cancer-care disaster, located as we are in a population-dense urban setting with overstretched infrastructure and an unparalleled workload of over 60 000 new cases of cancer annually, including nearly 3000 children, more than 95% being from outside Mumbai. Measures were initiated 2 weeks prior to the lockdown aimed at reducing outpatient footfall and conservation of supportive care resources and staff, as already detailed elsewhere. 3, 4 Within this larger response, we tailored management of pediatric cancers to meet the twin objectives of retaining hard-fought recent improvements in disease outcomes of largely curable malignancies, 5,6 while balancing resource constraints from disruption of services, and evolving strategies for the inevitable cancer with COVID-19 patient surge. Our priority was to immediately reduce the average of 300 daily outpatient visits to pediatric cancer units by more than 50%. Screening at entrance gates was done by medical teams that dispensed advice and medication for low-risk patients such as those on follow up or maintenance therapies without the patient needing to enter the premises, and they were later followed up telephonically. A comprehensive teleconsult facility was set up to prevent unwarranted visits by those due to follow up in the coming weeks from around the country. We achieved the targeted 50% reduction before the lockdown, which in turn led to travel disruptions preventing new cases reaching us. Despite these measures, 890 active cases were seen in the pediatric outpatient clinics with over 2900 clinic visits from March 21 to May 1, 2020, including 15 new cases. To reduce the strain on supportive care resources such as disruptions in blood product supplies, we were able to fall back on several measures that had been successfully used earlier. These included low-cost adaption of protocols that substituted high-dose methotrexate, and oral metronomic chemotherapy (OMCT) used in curative settings such as maintenance, or as a bridge to definitive therapy, by giving time to ameliorate severe comorbidities or socioeconomic constraints with necessary interventions prior to the standard treatment. These strategies have consistently yielded us acceptable and often excellent outcomes. 5-8 We rolled out a comprehensive set of measures including these and similar adaptations, and summarized them for easy reference. 9 These guidelines helped us to successfully brace for the initial COVID-19 surge, and a brief summary of the first seven cases of childhood cancer from among 59 COVID-19 patients in 5 weeks from the first recorded case seen at our center is included (Table 1) . With recent publicly available data showing no signs of the first wave abating in Mumbai and other parts of India, we have updated our guidelines to adapt to the rapidly changing external and internal logistics and pandemic realities.

913744293138f123350313c0d9c1fb802f4f79a4	Our L&D unit consists of 13 labor and delivery rooms and three operating rooms (ORs), with one of them having access to its own substerile scrub room. Therefore, this room has been designated as the preferred room for procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. We sought to provide a clinical practice protocol for our labor and delivery (L&D) unit, to care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients requiring cesarean delivery. A multidisciplinary team approach guidance was designed to simplify and streamline the flow and care of patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 requiring cesarean delivery. A protocol was designed to improve staff readiness, minimize risks, and streamline care processes. This is a suggested protocol which may not be applicable to all health care settings but can be adapted to local resources and limitations of individual L&D units. Guidance and information are changing rapidly; therefore, we recommend continuing to update the protocol as needed.
80b0e0b5afd8ebd1524ea67c88e40962dbb11c98	The COVID-19 pandemic and the strong social distancing measures adopted by governments around the world provide an ideal scenario to evaluate the trade-off between lives saved and morbidity avoided on the one hand and reduced economic resources on the other. We adapt the standard model of willingness to pay (WTP) for mortality/ morbidity risk reductions by incorporating a number of aspects that are highly relevant during an epidemic; namely, health-care capacity constraints, dynamic aspects of prevention (i.e., interventions aimed at flattening the epidemic curve), and distributional issues due to high heterogeneity in the underlying risks. The calibration of the model generates a WTP of the order of 24% of GDP. We conclude that the benefits in terms of lives saved and morbidity avoided can well justify the enormous economic costs generated by social distancing interventions. There is, however, significant that heterogeneity in WTP estimates depending on the degree of vulnerability to infection risk (e.g., by age), implying a large redistribution of income and well-being.

Primary care physicians have a major responsibility in quaternary prevention, and the establishment of clinical epidemiology as a distinct field of study would create a role charged with minimizing patient harm arising from over-medicalization.
f1486ab56384c1575a8e7bfdaf06fc8df348820f	Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging viral infectious disease. We report our experience in treating SARS patients. Methods: From April 27 to May 24, 2003, a total of 36 patients with probable SARS were admitted and treated in a hospital rearranged as a special center for the management of SARS patients. Medical records for the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with respiratory failure and intubation. Results: Of the 36 patients with probable SARS (median age, 37 years; range, 22-66 years), 9 were male and 27 were female. Thirty-two patients (88.9%) were infected in the hospital setting. All patients presented with fever, and 33 eventually developed lymphopenia during hospitalization. Chest radiography showed no unique pattern, but pleural effusion was not seen. All patients initially received empiric antibacterial therapy against common causative pathogens of atypical pneumonia. Ribavirin was given to all except 1 patient. Twenty-two patients received immunoglobulin therapy, and 32 were given corticosteroids. A total of 20 patients (55.6%) required supplemental oxygen, and 8 (22.2%) were intubated with mechanical ventilatory support. Two of these patients died. A higher body temperature at presentation (median 39.5 vs 38.6ºC), and higher peak values of lactate dehydrogenase (410 vs 282 U/L) and C-reactive protein (10.2 vs 2.5 mg/dL), were associated with subsequent respiratory failure. Multivariate analysis showed that peak level of C-reactive protein was the only independent predictor of respiratory failure and intubation (odds ratio for every increment of 1 mg/dL = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 1.003, 2.097; p = 0.048). Conclusion: All patients with probable SARS who were admitted to hospital presented with fever and lymphopenia. While the efficacy of different treatments could not be evaluated from this retrospective study, a higher value of C-reactive protein was associated with the development of respiratory failure and subsequent intubation.

be2378606c41620c835b5fd769a4da65000a7cb2	We propose that the palliative care team response will occur in two ways: first, communication and second, symptom management. Our experience with discussing goals of care with the family of a COVID-positive patient highlighted some expected and unexpected challenges. We describe these challenges along with recommendations for approaching these conversations. We also propose a framework for proactively mobilizing the palliative care workforce to aggressively address goals of care in all patients, with the aim of reducing the need for rationing of resources.

b95e82e0343a470f5b39c97eae9f8541e218b76d	Canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) is an alphacoronavirus infecting dogs that is closely related to enteric coronaviruses of cats and pigs. While CCoV has traditionally caused mild gastro-intestinal clinical signs, there are increasing reports of lethal CCoV infections in dogs, with evidence of both gastrointestinal and systemic viral dissemination. Consequently, CCoV is now considered to be an emerging infectious disease of dogs. In addition to the two known serotypes of CCoV, novel recombinant variants of CCoV have been found containing spike protein N-terminal domains (NTDs) that are closely related to those of feline and porcine strains. The increase in disease severity in dogs and the emergence of novel CCoVs can be attributed to the high level of recombination within the spike gene that can occur during infection by more than one CCoV type in the same host.
da97d77e4a1b41c06ad13dbee246961450d69fff	The bovine immune system is known for its unusual traits relating to immunoglobulin and antiviral responses. Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are phylogenetically conserved enzymes that cause post-translational deimination, contributing to protein moonlighting in health and disease. PADs also regulate extracellular vesicle (EV) release, forming a critical part of cellular communication. As PAD-mediated mechanisms in bovine immunology and physiology remain to be investigated, this study profiled deimination signatures in serum and serum-EVs in Bos taurus. Bos EVs were poly-dispersed in a 70-500 nm size range and showed differences in deiminated protein cargo, compared with whole sera. Key immune, metabolic and gene regulatory proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated with some overlapping hits in sera and EVs (e.g., immunoglobulins), while some were unique to either serum or serum-EVs (e.g., histones). Protein-protein interaction network analysis of deiminated proteins revealed KEGG pathways common for serum and serum-EVs, including complement and coagulation cascades, viral infection (enveloped viruses), viral myocarditis, bacterial and parasitic infections, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency intestinal IgA production, B-cell receptor signalling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, platelet activation and hematopoiesis, alongside metabolic pathways including ferroptosis, vitamin digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism and mineral absorption. KEGG pathways specific to EVs related to HIF-1 signalling, oestrogen signalling and biosynthesis of amino acids. KEGG pathways specific for serum only, related to Epstein-Barr virus infection, transcription mis-regulation in cancer, bladder cancer, Rap1 signalling pathway, calcium signalling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction. This indicates differences in physiological and pathological pathways for deiminated proteins in serum-EVs, compared with serum. Our findings may shed light on pathways underlying a number of pathological and anti-pathogenic (viral, bacterial, parasitic) pathways, with putative translatable value to human pathologies, zoonotic diseases and development of therapies for infections, including anti-viral therapies.
1be6068154d219951366017ff05f9144caaba78b	Objective To compare coronary flows between premature infants with and without hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) and to determine if coronary flow is influenced by medical PDA treatment. Design Prospective, observational pilot study. Forty-three infants <32 weeks gestation underwent echocardiography when routinely indicated. Study group included infants with hsPDA requiring treatment. Comparison groups included infants with nonsignificant PDA and infants without PDA. Results The study group (n = 13), compared with the comparison groups with nonsignificant PDA (n = 12) and without PDA (n = 18) had higher troponin levels (p = 0.003 and 0.004, respectively). In infants with hsPDA compared with infants with no PDA there was a significant increase in myocardial oxygen demand and decrease in left main coronary artery flow, with nonsignificant increase in cardiac output. Conclusions Decrease in coronary artery flows and higher troponin values may suggest a "steal effect," not allowing to meet the elevated myocardial oxygen demand in infants with hsPDA.
47cb2e627de6ba6040e542a112a67e51a3677f3f	Highlights d ISG15 is released from multiple cell types to signal to LFA-1expressing lymphocytes d Mutational analysis separates ISG15 secretion from LFA-1 binding and ISGylation d Intracellular conjugation of ISG15 negatively modulates its secretion d Viral de-ISGylases, including SARS-CoV-2 PL pro , positively modulate ISG15 secretion SUMMARY ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that also functions extracellularly, signaling through the LFA-1 integrin to promote interferon (IFN)-g release from natural killer (NK) and T cells. The signals that lead to the production of extracellular ISG15 and the relationship between its two core functions remain unclear. We show that both epithelial cells and lymphocytes can secrete ISG15, which then signals in either an autocrine or paracrine manner to LFA-1-expressing cells. Microbial pathogens and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists result in both IFN-b-dependent and -independent secretion of ISG15, and residues required for ISG15 secretion are mapped. Intracellular ISGylation inhibits secretion, and viral effector proteins, influenza B NS1, and viral de-ISGylases, including SARS-CoV-2 PL pro , have opposing effects on secretion of ISG15. These results establish extracellular ISG15 as a cytokine-like protein that bridges early innate and IFN-g-dependent immune responses, and indicate that pathogens have evolved to differentially inhibit the intracellular and extracellular functions of ISG15.
ff5a7e404a2522eab2a3d649428feaad576009de	Contemporary basic research is rapidly revealing increasingly complex molecular regulatory networks which are often interconnected via key signal integrators. These connections among regulatory and catalytic networks often frustrate bioengineers as promising metabolic engineering strategies are bypassed by compensatory metabolic responses or cause unexpected, undesired outcomes such as apoptosis, product protein degradation or inappropriate post-translational modification. Therefore, for metabolic engineering to achieve greater success in mammalian cell culture processes and to become important for future applications such as gene therapy and tissue engineering, this technology must be enhanced to allow simultaneous, in cases conditional, reshaping of metabolic pathways to access difficult-to-attain cell states. Recent advances in this new territory of multigene metabolic engineering are intimately linked to the development of multicistronic expression technology which allows the simultaneous, and in some cases, regulated expression of several genes in mammalian cells. Here we review recent achievements in multicistronic expression technology in view of multigene metabolic engineering.

cd58d0611c356e6d44a8eecb61bd2ac6a42f230a	Objectives: Predictions estimate supplies of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) would be limited in the event of a severe influenza pandemic. Ultraviolet decontamination and reuse (UVDR) is a potential approach to mitigate an FFR shortage. A field study sought to understand healthcare workers' perspectives and potential logistics issues related to implementation of UVDR methods for FFRs in hospitals. Methods: Data were collected at three hospitals using a structured guide to conduct 19 individual interviews, 103 focus group interviews, and 285 individual surveys. Data were then evaluated using thematic analysis to reveal key themes. Results: Data revealed noteworthy variation in FFR use across the sample, along with preferences and requirements for the use of UVDR, unit design, and FFR reuse. Based on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), the mean perception of safety in a high mortality pandemic wearing no FFR was 1.25 of 10, wearing an FFR for an extended period without decontamination was 4.20 of 10, and using UVDR was 7.72 of 10. Conclusions: In addition to technical design and development, preparation and training will be essential to successful implementation of a UVDR program. Ultraviolet decontamination and reuse program design and implementation must account for actual clinical practice, compliance with regulations, and practical financial considerations to be successfully adopted so that it can mitigate potential FFR shortages in a pandemic.
4e84f6a67b0cb8087b5948f5b161bdd66d565c48	Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many governments suspended outdoor activities and imposed social distancing policies to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These measures have had severe impact on the economy and peoples' daily lives. An alternative to widespread lockdowns is effective contact tracing during an outbreak's early stage. However, mathematical models (e.g., [24] ) suggest that epidemic control for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with manual contact tracing is implausible. To reduce the effort of contact tracing, many digital contact tracing projects (e.g., PEPP-PT [7], DP-3T [34], TCN [8], BlueTrace [13], Google/Apple Exposure Notification [4], and East/West Coast PACT [6, 17]) are being developed to supplement manual contact tracing. However, digital contact tracing has drawn scrutiny from privacy advocates, since governments or other parties may attempt to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance. As a result, many digital contact tracing projects build privacy-preserving mechanisms to limit the amount of privacy-sensitive information leaked by the protocol. In this paper, we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks, specifically DoS attacks, and present BlindSignedIDs, a privacypreserving digital contact tracing mechanism, which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers to limit the effectiveness of MAC-compliant DoS attacks. In our evaluations, we showed BlindSignedID can effectively deny bogus EphIDs, mitigating DoS attacks on the local storage beyond 90% of stored EphIDs. Our ex-ample DoS attacks showed that using 4 attackers can cause the gigabyte level DoS attacks within normal working hours and days.
8ae4a09bc3001554f0639e2b139ee2565fe1aad3	Background: We and others have shown that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) expression is increased in obesity/ atherosclerosis and is positively correlated with atherosclerotic burden. However, the mechanism by which DPP4 expression is regulated in obesity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the pathways regulating the expression of DPP4 on macrophages. Methods: Flowsight® Imaging Flow Cytometry was employed for the detection of DPP4 and immunophenotyping. DPP4 enzymatic activity was measured by a DPPIV-Glo™ Protease Assay kit. Findings: Human monocytes expressed a moderate level of membrane-bound DPP4. Obese patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 had a higher level of monocyte DPP4 expression, in parallel with higher levels of HOMA-IR, blood glucose, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol, compared to those in the non-obese (BMI b 30) patients. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but not native LDL, up-regulated DPP4 expression on macrophages with a preferential increase in CD36 + cells. OxLDL mediated DPP4 up-regulation was considerably diminished by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) knockdown and CD36 deficiency. TRIF deficiency, but not MyD88 deficiency, attenuated oxLDL-induced DPP4 increase. Interpretation: Our study suggests a key role for oxLDL and downstream CD36/TLR4/TRIF in regulating DPP4 expression. Increased DPP4 in response to oxidized lipids may represent an integrated mechanism linking postprandial glucose metabolism to lipoprotein abnormality-potentiated atherosclerosis.
521b8f72592093c1d8aa63039b88c54df83f4d3f	Chloroquine (CQ) is a weak base that was originally used to treat malaria infection. 1 However, recent findings have pinpointed the modulatory effect of CQ in models of chronic inflammation and viral infections. The antiviral effect of CQ and its derivative hydroxychloroquine has attracted great attention due to the recent Sars-CoV-2 virus outbreak. 2,3 As an immunomodulatory agent, CQ reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), likely by inducing regulatory T cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs). 4,5 EAE and multiple sclerosis (MS) are demyelinating disorders of the CNS in which interleukin (IL)-17-producing helper T (Th17) cells play a major role in disease severity. To date, there has been no report of the effect of CQ on T cell differentiation; thus, we aimed to investigate whether CQ interferes with Th17 cell differentiation. We isolated CD4 + T cells from the spleens of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice and activated the cells with agonistic anti-CD3/ CD28 antibodies under Th17 polarizing conditions in the presence or absence of CQ. We found that cultures with CQ had a significant decrease in IL-17 production (Fig. 1a) . Moreover, CQ at low concentrations was toxic to Th17 cells but not to Th1 cells or DCs (Fig. 1b) . Indeed, CQ augmented Th1 cell differentiation (Fig. 1b) . These results show that Th17 cells are more susceptible to CQ toxicity than Th1 cells and DCs. We then investigated whether CQ also impacts Tc17 cell differentiation and found that IL-17 production by CD8 + T cells was also reduced by CQ treatment (Fig. 1c) . Because T-bet and STAT1 are major suppressors of Th17 cell differentiation, 6,7 we aimed to investigate T-bet and STAT1 expression in CQ-treated cells. Cultures of CQ-treated Th17 cells with the least toxic dose of CQ had a significant increase in T-bet but not STAT1 expression (Fig. 1d) . This result is interesting because we recently showed that CQ-induced tolerogenic DCs rely on STAT1 expression to maintain their suppressive function. 8 Collectively, our current results indicate that, in T cells, CQ suppresses Th17 cell differentiation by stimulating T-bet rather than STAT1 expression. Finally, we investigated whether EAE suppression in CQtreated mice is associated with an increase in T-bet expression in Th17 cells. We immunized WT mice with MOG 35-55 peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant to induce EAE and monitored the mice daily for disease development. CQ treatment started once the mice showed the first signs of EAE (approximately day 10 p.i.) and continued for 7 consecutive days. Similar to what we previously published, 4 CQ-treated mice displayed significantly less severe EAE than PBS-treated mice (Fig. 1e) . Analysis of CNS cells at day 21 p.i. revealed that CQ-treated mice had a significant decrease in IL-17-producing Th17 cells and no effect on IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells compared with cells from PBStreated mice (Fig. 1f) . Further analyses showed that STAT1 expression was unchanged, while T-bet expression was increased in Th17 cells in the CNS of CQ-treated mice compared with those treated with PBS (Fig. 1g) . Collectively, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which CQ reduces inflammation in EAE through inducing T-bet expression in T cells and reducing Th17 differentiation. Interestingly, the shift in the balance between Th17/Th1 cells towards IFNγ production may reflect another pathway by which CQ augments antiviral responses. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Our results provide further evidence that CQ may be a powerful therapeutic agent in MS and the other chronic inflammatory diseases of the CNS.
d3c88dbf8c201937db784f9cc2263a047c2e4723	Pneumonia can cause high morbidity and mortality due to the uncontrolled inflammation in the lung tissue. Calming the cytokine storm may be one key to save the life of patients with severe pneumonia. Here, inspired by the intrinsic affinity of platelets to the site of inflammation, we have engineered platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) for pneumonia-targeted drug delivery. It is demonstrated that PEVs that are easily generated from the activated platelets can selectively target pneumonia in the mice model with acute lung injury (ALI). By loading with [5-(p-Fluorophenyl)-2-ureido] thiophene-3-carboxamide (TPCA-1) that can inhibit the production of inflammatory factors, the PEVs significantly improve therapeutic benefits by inhibiting the pulmonary inflammatory cells infiltration, and calming local cytokine storm compared with the free drug-treated group. Furthermore, we find that PEVs could serve as a broad platform that can selectively target various inflammatory sites, including chronic atherosclerotic plaque, rheumatoid 2 arthritis and wound associated with skin.
68f17459a1e9f3f69f9eac86dd6a71942d5e0571	Objective: This study investigated the sources of stress, corresponding symptoms, and stress relief among nurses of the first Chinese anti-Ebola medical team during the Sierra Leone aid mission. Method: A purposive sampling method was used and 10 nurses were selected from the first Chinese anti-Ebola medical team that was dispatched to Sierra Leone. Data were collected via phone and semistructured interviews, then analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. Results: The data showed three major themes: (1) The causes of stress during the Sierra Leone aid mission mainly related to unsafety, responsibility, and unfamiliarity; (2) Physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms were documented; (3) Nurses experienced relief from stress after the mission. Conclusion: Targeted measures, proper responses and good community support can effectively lower stress among nurses on anti-Ebola missions.

71c1ca5162e0035b47a98956d601c0bb0ff6d711	Background: Normally, regulatory T cells (also known as T regulatory cells or Tregs) migrate into inflamed tissues, dampening inflammatory responses and hastening tissue repair (1). Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have protracted hospitalizations characterized by excessive systemic inflammation (cytokine storm) and delayed lung repair, which is partly due to reduced or defective Tregs (2). Objective: To describe outcomes in 2 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS who were treated with Tregs. Case Reports: The first patient was a 69-year-old man with autism who was hospitalized from his nursing home with COVID-19 -induced fever and dyspnea 1 week after initial symptom onset. Despite 5 days of receiving hydroxychloroquine and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, he progressed to ARDS and received tocilizumab on day 7 and mechanical ventilation beginning on day 8. Renal failure and shock developed, requiring continuous, venovenous hemofiltration and vasopressors. Refractory hypoxemia required prone positioning, neuromuscular paralysis, inhaled nitric oxide, and FIO 2 greater than 70%. We administered compassionate use, cryopreserved, allogeneic Tregs derived from cord blood (CB) and expanded ex vivo (Cellenkos) at 1 × 10 8 cells per dose intravenously on days 13 and 17. By day 17, he had returned to supine positioning, paralytics were withdrawn, inhaled nitric oxide was weaned to zero, FIO 2 was decreased to 50%, vasopressors were withdrawn, and inflammatory markers were reduced ( Table 1) . He was extubated on day 22. On day 25, he required a tracheostomy. He is currently receiving care in a weaning facility. The second patient was a 47-year-old man who was hospitalized for COVID-19 -induced fever and dyspnea 1 week after initial symptom onset. On day 2 of his hospitalization, he received tocilizumab, and hours later, he had increasing lactate levels and required mechanical ventilation and high-dose LETTERS
4d64fdae4e12b2123320d7e7e8b16b94c19e6ac1	Previous work shows that the mean first-passage time ͑MFPT͒ for random walks to a given hub node ͑node with maximum degree͒ in uncorrelated random scale-free networks is closely related to the exponent ␥ of power-law degree distribution P͑k͒ϳk −␥ , which describes the extent of heterogeneity of scale-free network structure. However, extensive empirical research indicates that real networked systems also display ubiquitous degree correlations. In this paper, we address the trapping issue on the Koch networks, which is a special random walk with one trap fixed at a hub node. The Koch networks are power-law with the characteristic exponent ␥ in the range between 2 and 3, they are either assortative or disassortative. We calculate exactly the MFPT that is the average of first-passage time from all other nodes to the trap. The obtained explicit solution shows that in large networks the MFPT varies lineally with node number N, which is obviously independent of ␥ and is sharp contrast to the scaling behavior of MFPT observed for uncorrelated random scale-free networks, where ␥ influences qualitatively the MFPT of trapping problem. As a fundamental dynamical process, random walks have received considerable interest from the scientific community. Recent work shows that the key quantity-mean first-passage time (MFPT) for random walks to a given hub node (node with highest degree) on uncorrelated random scale-free networks-is qualitatively reliant on the heterogeneity of network structure. However, in addition to the power-law behavior, most real systems are also characterized by degree correlations. In this paper, we study random walks on a family of recently proposed networks-Koch networks that are transformed from the well-known Koch curves and have simultaneously powerlaw degree distribution and degree correlations with the power exponent of degree distribution lying between 2 and 3. We explicitly determine the MFPT, i.e., the average of first-passage time to a target hub node averaged over all possible starting positions, and show that the MFPT varies linearly with node number, independent of the inhomogeneity of network structure. Our result indicates that the heterogeneous structure of Koch networks has little impact on the scaling of MFPT in the network family, which is in contrast with the result of MFPT previously reported for uncorrelated stochastic scale-free graphs. a͒ Electronic
8da224b5eba13cee28c3a95cb3c1e3c4d26e5a3a	Introduction: Better characterisation of the epidemiological data on respiratory viral infections among people with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) can help to implement efficient strategies to curb the burden of ARTI in Africa. We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and factors associated with respiratory viral infection in people of all ages with ARTI residing in Africa. Methods: This work will include cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, without any language restriction, on populations residing in African countries. We will consider studies that reported the prevalence of respiratory viruses in people with ARTI confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction technique. We will be searching PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The selection of relevant studies, extraction of data, and evaluation of the quality of the articles will be carried out independently by two review authors, and the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or intervention of a third author. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the χ 2 test on Cochrane's Q statistic. Publication bias will be assessed by the Egger test. Studies will be pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results will be presented by age group and subregion of Africa. Using meta-regression models, we will identify factors associated with viral infections in people with ARTI. Discussion: This systematic review and meta-analysis is based on published data and therefore does not require ethical approval. This work will serve as a basis for the development of strategies for prevention and control ARTI in Africa and will also serve to identify data gaps and guide future investigations. The final report will be published in peer-reviewed journals as a scientific article and presented in workshops, conferences, and scientific conferences. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO, CRD42018088261.
6374cbef785a976f1f0bf93ec2b439a0009d034f	Objectives: To design and test a ventilator circuit that can be used for ventilation of two or more patients with a single ventilator, while allowing individualization of tidal volume, fractional concentration of oxygen, and positive end-expiratory pressure to each patient, irrespective of the other patient's respiratory system mechanics. Design: Description and proof of concept studies. Settings: Respiratory therapy laboratory. Subjects: Ventilation of mechanical test lungs. Interventions: Following a previously advocated design, we used components readily available in our hospital to assemble two "bag-ina-box" breathing circuits. Each patient circuit consisted of a flexible bag in a rigid container connected via one-way valve to a test lung, along with an inline positive end-expiratory pressure valve, connected to the ventilator's expiratory limb. Compressed gas fills the bags during "patient" exhalation. During inspiration, gas from the ventilator, in pressure control mode, enters the containers and displaces gas from the bags to the test lungs. We varied tidal volume, "respiratory system" compliance, and positive end-expiratory pressure in one lung and observed the effect on the tidal volume of the other. Measurements and Main Results: We were able to obtain different tidal volume, dynamic driving pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure in the two lungs under widely different compliances in both lungs. Complete obstruction, or disconnection at the circuit connection to one test lung, had minimal effect (< 5% on average) on the ventilation to the co-ventilated lung. Conclusions: A secondary circuit "bag-in-the-box" system enables individualized ventilation of two lungs overcoming many of the concerns of ventilating more than one patient with a single ventilator.
f2eafcf71acd1626095a30b9d380bf35fac79a52	While the affordance of a project-based and instructor-facilitated curriculum is a strength of makerspaces, they can be challenging learning environments for many students. This paper recognizes the need for instructors to personalize their approach in supporting students' needs. While there are opportunities to create automated systems to help instructors personalize their interventions, much care must be taken to prevent the introduction of unintended outcomes. In this study, we designed a weekly personalized intervention cycle based on students' self-reports. The effect of such personalized intervention was then evaluated using a repeated measure ANOVA. Findings suggest that students receiving personalized interventions were more time efficient in makerspaces and on assignments. Additionally, they reported a lower level of frustration. Students with personalized intervention, however, expressed a lower sense of community. This suggests that while additional data provided to instructors can support personalized assistance, a more nuanced approach may be needed to avoid unintended consequences.

Il n'y a pas de notion de prise médicamenteuse mais une exposition éventuelle à des allergènes. Le patient a été traité dans l'hypothèse d'une pneumopathie communautaire (éventuellement atypique), sans amélioration. Il est hypoxémique. Le TDM retrouve un aspect de verre dépoli diffus, sans autre atteinte parenchymateuse. Il n'y a pas d'atteinte pleurale ou parenchymateuse. Le LBA retrouve initialement une alvéolite panachée (PNE > 10 %) puis lymphocytaire. La démarche diagnostique est celle d'une pneumopathie interstitielle aiguë avec des opacités diffuses en verre dépoli Le verre dépoli (ground glass) est défini comme une opacification fine des poumons avec respect des structures vasculaires. Dans sa forme pure, cet aspect n'est pas associé à des condensations alvéolaires ou des déformations du parenchyme. Initialement décrit à l'apparition des coupes tomodensitométriques millimétriques, cet aspect peut se voir également sur les coupes plus épaisses. Cet aspect a été décrit comme un signe d'atteinte précoce dans les pathologies interstitielles, mais n'est pas constant et dans 1/3 des cas, cet aspect est retrouvé associé à des signes de fibrose. Ce signe est également souvent retrouvé à la périphérie de condensation alvéolaire et représente alors un comblement alvéolaire partiel. Enfin le verre dépoli peut être associé à un épaississement septal interlobulaire : l'association des deux signes donne l'aspect caractéristique en mosaique (crazy paving). Cas clinique n°1
b5bb2a61bd4207c1b808b291fabab77d3793cd2c	Sequencing analysis of the isolates of a recently identified pathogen associated with respiratory infections, human bocavirus (HBoV), allowed for identification of two virus genotypes of the virus. In the current article a new method for a simple and fast differentiation of HBoV genotypes in clinical materials is described. The test includes an amplification of a 309 bp fragment of VP1/VP2 gene of HBoV from nasopharyngeal aspirates with a subsequent incubation of a PCR mix with the BstAPI endonuclease. Upon such a digestion, the DNA fragment derived from the genotype I HBoV isolates forms two fragments of 150 and 159 bp, while that obtained from genotype 2 isolates remains unrestricted. The developed technique may be used in epidemiological studies of HBoV infection and analysis of the potential differences in biological characteristics of HboV genotypes.
a150d3ebcf4d4c4b3fec04262363d9b012c844cd	The age-specific prevalence of CF antibodies against 16 viral antigens was determined by using the computerized data registry of the routine diagnostic laboratory of the authors' department. The material consisted of data based on serum specimens from about 58,500 patients. All ages from newborn infants to 90-yearolds were represented. The sera had been collected and tested with a CF screening test over a period of 8 years (1971)(1972)(1973)(1974)(1975)(1976)(1977)(1978). Several different antibody prevalence patterns were distinguished in regard to the rapidity and timing of the initial increase of the prevalence, as well as to the mode of later changes in prevalence. For most respiratory viruses a rapid increase of the prevalence was seen through the childhood continuing, for some of them, up to the 30s (influenza A and coronavirus), while rather variable patterns were found in the older age groups. Herpes simplex and cytomegaloviruses showed, interestingly, another type of pattern: a slow increase of prevalence continuing through the whole age range. The frequency of herpes simplex antibodies reached 90% by the age of 80 years. Antibody levels against any antigen in infants less than one-month-old were equal to those in 20-to 40-year-old adults, and the expected rapid decrease of antibodies took place within the first 6 months of life. Possible influences of epidemics and repeated exposures to different viruses (external boosting), and of latent or chronic infections (internal boosting), as wells as of technical variations, on the observed prevalence patterns are discussed.
26efe2480c96d93ed23f8adf49ace5671c55d6d1	Respiratory infections remain a common and serious complication of transplantation and chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Manifestations are often more severe than in immunocompetent hosts and may be atypical. Human herpesviruses (HHVs) cause a major burden of disease in patients with impaired immunity and cause a wide spectrum of disease, including pulmonary infection. In addition, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and HHV-8 are oncogenic viruses, and in certain settings, infection with these pathogens may evolve into malignancy that can include respiratory tract involvement. This review will focus on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, treatment, and preventive strategies for infection by HHVs in immunocompromised persons, including hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), also known as HHV-5, is a ubiquitous human DNA virus of the subfamily β-Herpesviridae. It typically infects individuals early in life, with rates of seropositivity varying from 40% in industrialized countries to 100% in some underdeveloped countries. 1,2 Acute CMV infection in immunocompromised hosts such as SOTor HCT recipients and those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) not only causes direct morbidity and mortality, it may have widespread indirect effects on the host. 3 Despite progress in the management of CMV infection, it remains a leading complication of transplantation, and prevention and treatment of active CMV can positively impact transplant outcomes. 4 Among immunocompromised individuals, members of the human Herpesviridae family are frequently encountered pathogens. Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus-6, -7, and -8 all establish latency after infection and can reactivate during periods of immunosuppression, leading to both direct and indirect adverse effects on the host including severe organ dysfunction as well as allograft rejection and loss after transplantation. While not all herpesviruses are primary respiratory pathogens, many of their manifestations include involvement of the respiratory tract. This article discusses the individual viruses, their epidemiology, and clinical manifestations as well as recommended treatment and preventive strategies.
cceee3984733759b9df0d9e93282fc752e078472	Background: The relationship between inducible nitric oxide synthatase activity and disease severity in leptospirosis is unclear. Nitric oxide is converted to nitrites and nitrates, thus nitrite and nitrate levels (NO x ) in serum are considered surrogate markers for nitric oxide. NO x are excreted through the kidneys, and elimination is diminished in renal impairment. We assessed the correlation of NO x with disease severity in patients with leptospirosis, compared with healthy controls and non-leptospirosis fever patients.
7c3558549f196281b958744fc66cee604d0ef801	According to Beck's 'World at Risk' theory, global risks push nations towards a cosmopolitisation of their health policy and open opportunities for a democratic turn. This article provides an empirical analysis of Beck's theory, based on the experience of Vietnamese authorities from 2003 to 2007 in managing the emerging avian flu virus. It shows how Vietnam's framing of avian flu has shifted, under the pressure from international organisations and the US administration, from an epizootic and zoonotic risk (or a classic risk) to a pandemic threat (or a late modern risk). Vietnam's response was part of its overall strategy to join the World Trade Organization and it was limited by Vietnam's defence of its sovereignty. This strategy has been successful for Vietnam but has limited the possibility of cosmopolitan and democratic transformations. The case study highlights the constructed dimension of risks of late modernity and their possible instrumentalisation: it minimises the role of a community of fear relative to a community of trade.
a780aef42860533f02e613494ddb8283b9fbe83d	Infectious diseases are an important cause of human death. The study of the pathogenesis, spread regularity, and development trend of infectious diseases not only provides a theoretical basis for future research on infectious diseases, but also has practical guiding significance for the prevention and control of their spread. In this paper, a controlled differential equation and an objective function of infectious diseases were established by mathematical modeling. Based on cellular automata theory and a compartmental model, the SLIRDS (Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible) model was constructed, a model which can better reflect the actual infectious process of infectious diseases. Considering the spread of disease in different populations, the model combines population density, sex ratio, and age structure to set the evolution rules of the model. Finally, on the basis of the SLIRDS model, the complex spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was simulated. The simulation results are similar to the macroscopic characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in real life, thus the accuracy and rationality of the SLIRDS model are confirmed.

The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of PECV infection in pig farms in Korea, and to compare the evolutionary inter-relationships between Korean PECVs and other caliciviruses. Among 102 diarrhoeic faecal samples of sucking (n ¼ 50) and weaned (n ¼ 52) piglets from 31 different farms in Korea, five samples (4.9%) were detected positive by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but nine (8.8%) by nested-PCR. Furthermore, we found that Korean PECVs are closely related to SVs.
0749c43225ca186b835f7fb71b53cd74724a63b0	Objective: Antirheumatic disease therapies have been used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 and its complications. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the current evidence. Methods: A search of published and preprint databases in all languages was performed. Included studies described one or more relevant clinical outcomes in five or more people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and were treated with antirheumatic disease therapy between 01/01/2019 and 05/29/2020. Pairs of reviewers screened articles and extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A meta-analysis of effect sizes using the random-effects models was performed when possible. The search identified 3,935 articles, of which 45 were included (4 randomized controlled trials, 29 cohort studies, and 12 case series). All studies evaluated hospitalized patients and 29 out of 45 had been published in a peer-reviewed journal. In a meta-analysis of three cohort studies with a low risk of bias, hydroxychloroquine use was not significantly associated with mortality (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.42). In a meta-analysis of two cohort studies with some concerns/high risk of bias, anakinra use was associated with lower mortality (pooled HR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.4). Evidence was inconclusive with regard to other antirheumatic disease therapies and the majority of other studies had a high risk of bias. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, hydroxychloroquine use was not associated with benefit or harm with regard to COVID-19 mortality. The evidence supporting the effect of other antirheumatic disease therapies in COVID-19 is currently inconclusive. Accepted Article
30007dbcd10dad543792a597597030b43ff71d4e	Background The COVID-19 pandemic confronts healthcare workers, including neurosurgeons, with difficult choices regarding which patients to treat. Methods In order to assist ethical triage, this article gives an overview of the main considerations and ethical principles relevant when allocating resources in times of scarcity. Results We discuss a framework employing four principles: prioritizing the worst off, maximizing benefits, treating patients equally, and promoting instrumental value. We furthermore discuss the role of age and comorbidity in triage and highlight some principles that may seem intuitive but should not form a basis for triage. Conclusions This overview is presented on behalf of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies and can be used as a toolkit for neurosurgeons faced with ethical dilemmas when triaging patients in times of scarcity.
571ec1458866ae8ce9f2753aa468d45b0627c2f3	This chapter presents a new model of thinking for evaluating social development work. The social assessment framework put forward is based on TNS stakeholder management model, TRI*M, and focuses on the critical area of how aid and donor organizations can assess the effectiveness of social development programs. The Millennium Development Goals have opened up a two way street between donors and beneficiaries and has provided for a need to look at social development assessment from a new perspective. The reader is taken through a journey of how the model came about, challenges faced during the process, and a vision for how the model will be used in the future. The two basic components of the model, the Program Effectiveness Index and the TRI*M Grid for understanding program drivers, are explained. A case study covering the Tsunami relief effort in Aceh, where the model was used for the first time, is included as an example of how TNS was able to deliver insight and clear direction in an otherwise complex environment. A client perspective is also provided both in terms of needs assessment and actions taken by UNICEF as a result. The chapter concludes with a reflection of what the future holds and the opportunity to apply the framework in other countries as well as for different situations.
d12f22eb235332248406e89f3badacc97a0c2cbc	Focus group discussions were organized in each of the study areas to assess the knowledge and cultural beliefs of subjects on bats (1). To ensure unbiased representation from the community, subjects with diverse occupations and economic status were selected. Discussion guides were used to generate open discussions in three key areas: importance of bats, cultural beliefs about bats and negative impacts of bats in the communities. Subjects were organized in 8-12 per group and interviews were conducted by trained field research assistants. General discussions especially on sensitive subjects was led by a group leader selected by participants. The focus group leader concept was used to encourage participants to disclose information freely. Responses obtained from the groups were documented and similar results were aggregated using tallies. All discussions were conducted in the local dialect of respondents. The study site was divided into four areas based on the major roads. Social centers in each quadrant were identified, and every other adjacent house starting from the social center was marked and respondents were interviewed using structured questionnaires. Respondents were from 13 years and above. Data was collected on demographics, bat cave-associated activities, contact with bats, bites and scratches from bats and the use of bats for food, medicinal or ritual purposes. An exposure to bats was defined as a bite or scratch from a bat or circumstances such as direct skin contact with a bat, bat urine or guano. Quantitative data from questionnaires were recorded using EPI INFO version 5 (2), and imported into Microsoft® Excel. Subsequent analysis was performed using R statistical software version 3.0.2 (3). Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square or Fischer's
8ceaaa87a76db5f305006a242a690c597b302a5c	In many areas, researchers might think that a differential equation model is required, but one might be forced to use an approximate difference equation model if data is only available at discrete points in time. In this paper, a detailed comparison is given of the behavior of continuous and discrete models for two representative time-delay models, namely a model for HIV and an extended logistic growth model. For each model, there are seven different time-delay versions because there are seven different positions to include time delays. For the seven different time-delay versions of each model, proofs are given of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium points and for the existence of Andronov-Hopf bifurcations in the differential equations and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations in the difference equations. We show that only five of the seven time-delay versions have bifurcations and that all bifurcation versions have supercritical limit cycles with one having a repelling cycle and four having attracting cycles. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the analytical results and to show that critical times for Neimark-Sacker bifurcations are less than critical times for Andronov-Hopf bifurcations but converge to them as the time step of the discretization tends to zero.

In this report, we present chest CT findings from five patients with 2019-nCoV infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results. All five patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) (5 patients) and/or mixed GGO and mixed consolidation (2 patients). After isolation for presumed 2019-nCoV pneumonia, all patients were eventually confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection by repeated swab tests.

3b9caf9aa7ce03474dbaec94fe24cc6cd3150e55	Introduction: Yersinia enterocolitica infection is a zoonotic disease that varies from self-limited gastroenteritis to more severe forms. Its propensity to affect the terminal ileum and to spread to regional lymph nodes explains the potential misdiagnosis with appendicitis. Methods: We reviewed the Y. enterocolitica infection cases in a pediatric population for the last 12 years. Results: There were 11 cases of Y. enterocolitica infection in the selected period. Four patients had a suspected surgical diagnosis: 1 intussusception, 3 acute appendicitis. Patients who presented with appendicitis-like features were older, whereas younger children most commonly presented with diarrhea and fever. Ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were performed in appendicitis-like patients and ruled out appendicitis in 2 of the 3 cases. The only patient submitted to surgery had abnormal CT findings and an important risk factor for this infection that was not recognized at presentation. Conclusion: This condition should be considered in patients with known risk factors (such as iron overload) and with the right epidemiological setting when presenting with abdominal symptoms. The suspicion of this diagnosis in these particular cases might obviate unnecessary surgical interventions.

It is now a global pandemic and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be a Betacoronavirus (lineage B) closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it has been reported to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Subsequently, betacoronaviruses from pangolins were identified as close relatives to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we perform structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.
3e35ff32458a72969e8a16972a4d16bc9f89478d	COVID-19 pandemy has ignited a broad scientific interest in coronavirus research. The identification of coronaviridae species in natural reservoirs often requires de novo assembly. However, existing transcriptome assemblers often are not able to assemble coronaviruses into a single contig. We developed coronaSPAdes, a new module for SPAdes assembler for coronavirus species recovery. coronaSPAdes uses the knowledge about coronaviridae genome structure to improve assembly. We have shown that coronaSPAdes outperforms existing SPAdes modes and other popular short-read assemblers in the recovery of full-length coronavirus genomes. This should allow to better understand the coronaviridae spread and diversity. Background COVID-19 pandemy has increased a scientific interest in coronavirus research. The analysis of coronavirus dataset starts with obtaining full-length virus genome sequence that can be performed using read alignment[1,2] or de novo assembly [1,3]. The assembly pipeline based on read alignment is a tool of choice for the same strains of the close species, e.g. for SARS-CoV-2 SNP profiling of confirmed COVID-19 patients. De novo assembly is better suited for novel species recovery since read alignment for distant species is unreliable. Recently, there were multiple studies that used MEGAHIT[4] assembler to recover full-length sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Though previous studies show that different SPAdes[5] modes also perform well in virus recovery [6]. Nevertheless, none of these assemblers was initially designed for viral assemblies in general and for coronaviridae species recovery in particular. MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes[7] are metagenomic assemblers, SPAdes[8] is designed to assemble single-cell and isolate bacterial datasets. All these assemblers can produce fragmented assemblies due to sequencing artifacts, coverage variations, host contamination, multiple strains presence, and coronavirus splice events [9]. Fast and correct characterization of virus datasets might be a key step in predicting and preventing the future outbreaks. Coronaviruses have a conserved gene structure[10] that can help to better assemble full-length genomes. In this study, we present coronaSPAdes -a new mode for SPAdes assembler designed to assemble coronaviridae species.

For example , C57BL/6 (B6) mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (JHM strain , JHMV) develop severe encephalitis , with death occurring within 7 days. Here, we show that the host response to a single JHMVspecific immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitope is critical for severe disease. We engineered a recombinant JHMV with mutations in the immunodominant CD4 T-cell epitope (rJ.M Y135Q ). Infection of naïve B6 mice with this virus resulted in mild disease with no mortality. However , introduction of a CD4 T-cell epitope from Listeria monocytogenes into rJ.M Y135Q generated a highly virulent virus. The decrease in disease severity was not due to a switch from Th1 to Th2 predominance in rJ.M Y135Q -infected mice , an effect on CD8 T-cell function , or differential expression of tumor necrosis factor-␣ by JHMV-specific CD4 T cells. These results show that the response to a single virus-specific CD4 T-cell epitope may contribute to a pathogenic host response in the setting of acute viral disease and that abrogation of this response ameliorates clinical disease without diminishing virus clearance.
22dd310ddf6a5f0f728a520211d8617e6a7bca64	In this systematic literature review, a study of the factors involved in the spreading of fake news, have been provided. In this review, the root causes of the spreading of fake news are identified to reduce the encouraging of such false information. To combat the spreading of fake news on social media, the reasons behind the spreading of fake news must first be identified. Therefore, this literature review takes an early initiative to identify the possible reasons behind the spreading of fake news. The purpose of this literature review is to identify why individuals tend to share false information and to possibly help in detecting fake news before it spreads.
ab6bcf99f47aef2fcfaaeb674a6a7436a575581e	Different epidemiological models, from the classical SIR system to more sophisticated ones involving population compartments for socially distanced, quarantined, infection aware, asymptomatic infected, and other individuals, share some remarkable dynamic characteristics when contact rates are subject to periodic or one-shot changes. In simple pulsed isolation policies, a linear relationship is found among optimal start time and duration for reduction of the infected peak. If a single interval social distancing starts too early or too late it will be ineffective with respect to decreasing the peak of infection. On the other hand, the nonlinearity of epidemic models leads to non-monotone behavior of the peak of infected population under periodic relaxation policies. This observation led us to hypothesize that an additional single interval social distancing at a proper time can significantly decrease the infected peak of periodic policies, and we verified this improvement. 2. Modeling the effects of social distancing for an infection aware population. This can be done by changing the contact rates between the compartments, or by modeling the behavior of a population that alters its social interactions because of observed infections or deaths [44, 45] . The latter technique has recently been applied to 47] . 3. Sub-dividing populations into regions, each described by local parameters. Such regions may be cities, neighborhoods, or communities [48]. This framework allows modelers to capture the virus spread and population mobility geographically [49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. These models have been recently used to understand the spread of COVID-19 in China [54], Italy [55], Belgium [56], and India [57, 58].
c69550e29123d3f2c9ab39dd3ca65733df29864a	The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory parameters distinguishing viral from nonviral lower respiratory tract infection in elderly patients and to determine the yield of virological diagnostics in elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infection. The study was conducted in a 184-bed geriatric department in a university hospital during 4 winter months. All consecutive elderly persons admitted with a lower respiratory tract infection were included in the study. Clinical and laboratory parameters, a nasopharyngeal swab, and serological results for respiratory viruses were obtained for all participants. Available blood and sputum cultures were analysed. A total of 165 elderly persons (mean age, 82€6.8 years) were hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection. Familial flu-like illness (OR, 4.25; 95%CI, 1.4-13), better functionality (OR, 4; 95%CI, 1.3-14.15), and leucocyte count <10 10 /l (OR, 3; 95%CI, 1.3-7.1) were predictive for viral lower respiratory tract infection. Sixty (36.5%) definite diagnoses (positive blood culture, viral culture, or serological test) and seven (4.2%) probable diagnoses (positive sputum culture) were obtained. An early diagnosis (within 72 h) was possible in 38 (23%) and a late diagnosis in 29 (17.6%) participants. A nasopharyngeal swab contributed in 60.5% of the cases to an early diagnosis. Viral culture identified half (22/43) of the lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza but only one of six lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, a history of flu-like illness in family members and a total leucocyte count within normal limits makes a viral cause more likely in elderly people hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection during winter. Viral culture and rapid antigen detection are insensitive in elderly patients hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection.
f63f16b8f3f0922d4cb5af724af6eb06fc601e17	Existed evidences show that airborne transmission of human respiratory droplets may be related with the spread of some infectious disease, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 pandemic. Non-pharmaceutical approaches, including ventilation system and personal protection, are believed to have certain positive effects on the reduction of co-occupant's inhalation. This work then aims to numerically study the performances of mouth covering on co-occupant's exposure under mixing ventilation (MV), under-floor air distribution (UFAD) and displacement ventilation (DV) system, using drift-flux model. Desk partition, as one generally employed arrangement in plan office, is also investigated under MV. The dispersion of 1, 5 and 10 μm droplet residuals are numerically calculated and CO 2 is used to represent tracer gas. The results show that using mouth covering by the infected person can reduce the co-occupant's inhalation greatly by interrupting direct spread of the expelled droplets, and best performance can be achieved under DV since the coughed air is mainly confined in the microenvironment of the infected person. The researches under MV show that the two interventions, mouth covering and desk partition, achieve almost the same inhalation for fine droplets while the inhalation of the co-occupant is lower when using mouth covering for large droplets.
1c9b3aa2252e7d57adf0503f71d57f5bc17d49df	In December 2019, a novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged, causing an outbreak of lifethreatening pneumonia in the Hubei province, China, and has now spread worldwide, causing a pandemic. The urgent need to control the disease, combined with the lack of specific and effective treatment modalities, call for the use of FDA-approved agents that have shown efficacy against similar pathogens. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin have all been successful in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The initial results of a number of clinical trials involving various protocols of administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine mostly point towards their beneficial effect. However, they may not be effective in cases with persistently high viremia, while results on ivermectin (another antiparasitic agent) are not yet available. Interestingly, azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic in combination with hydroxychloroquine, might yield clinical benefit as an adjunctive. The results of clinical trials point to the potential clinical efficacy of antivirals, especially remdesivir (GS-5734), lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir. Other therapeutic options that are being explored J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Drożdżal et al., Clinically approved drugs … SARS-CoV-2 2 involve meplazumab, tocilizumab, and interferon type 1. We discuss a number of other drugs that are currently in clinical trials, whose results are not yet available, and in various instances we enrich such efficacy analysis by invoking historic data on the treatment of SARS, MERS, influenza, or in vitro studies. Meanwhile, scientists worldwide are seeking to discover novel drugs that take advantage of the molecular structure of the virus, its intracellular life cycle that probably elucidates unfolded-protein response, as well as its mechanism of surface binding and cell invasion, like angiotensin converting enzymes-, HR1, and metalloproteinase inhibitors.
de0eb1881721fde9e76d47c0aa2f585d65f8bab1	To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to prevent the further transmissions. 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), basic reproduction number, epidemiology
6009d1441521ff378e6fbc8f66a4700664c28796	The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus (IAV) is a multifunctional protein that antagonizes host antiviral responses, modulating virus pathogenesis. As such, it serves as a good target for research and diagnostic assay development. In this study, we have generated a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) 19H9 and epitope mapping revealed that two residues, P85 and Y89, of NS1 are essential for interacting with this mAb. Furthermore, residues P85 and Y89 are found to be highly conserved across different IAV subtypes, namely seasonal H1N1 and H3N2, as well as the highly pathogenic H5N1 and H5N6 avian strains. Indeed, mAb 19H9 exhibits broad cross-reactivity with IAV strains of different subtypes. The binding of mAb 19H9 to residue Y89 was further confirmed by the abrogation of interaction between NS1 and p85β. Additionally, mAb 19H9 also detected NS1 proteins expressed in IAV-infected cells, showing NS1 intracellular localization in the cytoplasm and nucleolus. To our knowledge, mAb 19H9 is the first murine mAb to bind at the juxtaposition between the N-terminal RNA-binding domain and C-terminal effector domain of NS1. It could serve as a useful research tool for studying the conformational plasticity and dynamic changes in NS1.
619c8d0974c2cc54d6f990c400c8587dba07cd40	We present a block preconditioner, based on the algebraic multigrid method, for solving systems of linear equations, that arise in incompressible flow simulations performed by the stabilized finite element method. We select a set of adjustable parameters for the preconditioner and show how to tune the parameters in order to obtain fast convergence of the standard GMRES solver in which the preconditioner is employed. Additionally, we show some details of the parallel implementation of the preconditioner and the achieved scalability of the solver in large scale parallel incompressible flow simulations.
768222201c6672c6a0a8bc172298d441b9ee9f4f	Background: The current outbreak caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected. : We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs. Results: An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10 -2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.a b c d
d12b31daa935e9043a9f526a2547b6216ada7cde	We tested samples collected from nine patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus was found in urine, blood, anal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs. It is the first time for SARS-CoV-2 found in urine, though no urinary irritation was found.
078025b470595541bbb492b1aaed90862cdca287	At the beginning of the 21st century, antimicrobial resistance is common, has developed against every class of antimicrobial drug, and appears to be spreading into new clinical niches. We describe determinants likely to influence the future epidemiology and health impact of antimicrobialresistant infections. Understanding these factors will ultimately optimize preventive strategies for an unpredictable future.
c909ec440809095e4c1ce74a6fa5b195def29e11	Objectives: To describe the prevalence and distribution of anxiety and depression among Mexican population, and to examine its association with internet addiction during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design: A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting: General population in México. Participants: 561 subjects were recruited (71% female, mean age 30.7 ± 10.6 years). Interventions: An online survey to assess personal attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19, sleep-disorders related, the Mexican version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) was applied. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Prevalence of anxiety, depression, internet addiction and sleep disorders and associated factors. Also, prevalence for anxiety and depression were compared to an historic control group. Results: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence for anxiety and depression was 50% (95% CI, 45.6% to 54.1%) and 27.6%, (95% CI 23.8% to 31.4%), respectively. We found a 51% (33% to 50%) increase in anxiety and up to 86% increase in depression during the initial weeks of the lock-down compared to the control group. According to the IAT questionnaire, 62.7% (95% CI 58.6% to 68.8%) of our population had some degree of internet addiction. Odds ratio for development of anxiety symptoms was 2.02 (95% CI1.56-2.1, p=0.0001) and for depression was 2.15 (95% CI 1.59-2.9, p=0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, younger age (p=0.006), sleep problems (p=0.000), and internet addiction ( p=0.000) were associated with anxiety and depression. Our study provides valuable information on the psychological impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the Mexican population. As in other parts of the globe, in Mexico, fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection has had devastating consequences on mental health, such as anxiety, depression and sleeping disturbances. Internet abuse and the consequent overexposure to rapidly spreading misinformation (infodemia) are associated to anxiety and depression. • Our study have addressed the immediate psychological effect of the pandemic in the general population in a Latin American country, specifically in Mexico, a nation with high population density. • Using the IAT ( a specific tool to assess internet dependency), we found internet addiction was highly prevalent and correlated to anxiety and depression. • We used the snowball sampling strategy; thus, our population is biased and may not reflect the actual pattern of general population. • We decided to compare anxiety and depression with an historic cohort, and although this control group is not exactly matched to our studied population, the prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders are like those reported previously in Mexico. • Other limitations include response bias due to fewer older subjects participating, the fact that sleep problems were not rigorously evaluated with a specific tool, and some states in our country were not represented in this work.
8806d2b5dd6c0709ed0fc8e99153cbef69fd4614	Background: Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major pathogens involved in the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex. The seroprevalence to BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear. The aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of BRD and to perform phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains. Results: BRSV infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. When serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were present, the number of BRSV positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view of BRSV as the main pathogen. Sequencing of the G gene of BRSV positive samples showed that the current circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong to genetic subgroup II, along with other North European isolates. One isolate from an outbreak in Norway in 1976 was also investigated. This strain formed a separate branch in subgroup II, clearly different from the current Scandinavian sequences. The currently circulating BRSV could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time. The sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the G protein. The results demonstrated that BRSV is the most important etiological agent of epidemics of BRD in Norway and that it often acts as the only viral agent. The phylogenetic analysis of the Norwegian strains of BRSV and several previously published isolates supported the theory of geographical and temporal clustering of BRSV.
4b17934f88f73e2414aab28cd49dd50e67915d34	An urgent demand of assessing passengers' exposure risks in airliner cabins was raised as commercial airliners are one of the major media that carrying and transmitting infectious disease worldwide. In this study, simulations were conducted using a Boeing 737 cabin model to study the transport characteristics of airborne droplets and the associated infection risks of passengers. The numerical results of the airflow field were firstly compared against the experimental data in the literature to validate the reliability of the simulations. Airborne droplets were assumed to be released by passengers through coughing and their transport characteristics were modelled using the Lagrangian approach. Numerical results found that the particle travel distance was very sensitive to the release locations, and the impact was more significant along the longitudinal and horizontal directions. Particles released by passengers sitting next to the windows could travel much further than the others. A quantifiable approach was then applied to assess the individual infection risks of passengers. The key particle transport information such as the particle residence time yielded from the Lagrangian tracking process was extracted and integrated into the Wells-Riley equation to estimate the risks of infection. Compared to the Eulerian-based approach, the Lagrangian-based approach presented in this study is more robust as it addresses both the particle concentration and particle residence time in the breathing zone of every individual passenger.
d3a1699f0d287bdf87132875b16c53a56a8d9d5d	The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.
1ac29ed81f2c555635d5fb80ffe38913b07a6c21	Recombinant canine coronaviruses, resembling the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) in a 5 fragment of the S glycoprotein, have been detected recently and showed to be present in canine populations. The 5 fragment of the S protein (S ) of a TGEV-like canine coronavirus (CCoV), strain 174/06, was expressed in an Escherichia coli cell-free system. The purified recombinant polypeptide was employed to develop an ELISA test for the detection of TGEV-like CCoV-specific antibodies in dog sera. Four canine sera positive for TGEV-like CCoV, six sera positive to classical CCoV-II strains and 10 negative control sera were examined. The recombinant S was not recognized by antibodies to classical CCoV-II, as only sera from dogs infected experimentally with TGEV-like CCoV reacted strongly with the recombinant S polypeptide whereas dog sera with antibodies to classical CCoV-II did not react. As classical CCoV-II and TEGV-like CCoVs are related antigenically, the recombinant S ELISA is a useful method to investigate serologically the prevalence of TGEV-like CCoVs in dogs.
72c999a8bc7d87b1c72590f52d1646d15f39f163	Italy was the first country in Europe which imposed control measures of travel restrictions, quarantine and contact precautions to tackle the epidemic spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in all its regions. While such efforts are still ongoing, uncertainties regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and ascertainment of cases make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of restrictions. Here, we employed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) model to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, working on the number of reported patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and deaths in Sicily (Italy), from 24 February to 13 April. Overall, we obtained a good fit between estimated and reported data, with a fraction of unreported SARS-CoV-2 cases (18.4%; 95%CI = 0-34.0%) before 10 March lockdown. Interestingly, we estimated that transmission rate in the community was reduced by 32% (95%CI = 23-42%) after the first set of restrictions, and by 80% (95%CI = 70-89%) after those adopted on 23 March. Thus, our estimates delineated the characteristics of SARS-CoV2 epidemic before restrictions taking into account unreported data. Moreover, our findings suggested that transmission rates were reduced after the adoption of control measures. However, we cannot evaluate whether part of this reduction might be attributable to other unmeasured factors, and hence further research and more accurate data are needed to understand the extent to which restrictions contributed to the epidemic control.
6c0c329acc452033187b0b26e4b78a1b7bb5945c	The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 prompted stringent mitigation measures to "flatten the curve" quickly leading to an asphyxiated US economy as a national side effect. The resulting flattened curve remain exponential and may still exceed available healthcare resources and capacity during and around its peak. Moreover, while isolation and containment can scale down daily cases significantly, such a mitigation strategy also prolong the outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely having disasterous repercussions. Mitigation for the duration of the outbreak may therefore be unsustainable and risk a second wave of infections. The method for active pandemic curve management (MAPCM) presented herein has the potential to shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which equates to the ramping up of economic activity, and it leaves breathing room for the economy from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as projected hospitalizations per day) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak. To be successful the method must be implemented early enough in the outbreak. Implementing the method incorrectly can result in a herd immunity levels of infections. MAPCM is a method and not a model. It is compatible with any appropriate model. In the paper a hybrid logistic model is used for illustration.
bf603ce616f92337f3b19b27b97b6bdbe5c1f21b	The flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis is an obligate human genitourinary parasite and the most frequent cause of sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Most clinical isolates of T. vaginalis are persistently infected with one or more double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses from the genus Trichomonasvirus, family Totiviridae, which appear to influence not only protozoan biology but also human disease. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 (TVV1) virions, as determined by electron cryomicroscopy and icosahedral image reconstruction. The structure reveals a T ‫؍‬ 1 capsid comprising 120 subunits, 60 in each of two nonequivalent positions, designated A and B, as previously observed for fungal Totiviridae family members. The putative protomer is identified as an asymmetric AB dimer consistent with either decamer or tetramer assembly intermediates. The capsid surface is notable for raised plateaus around the icosahedral 5-fold axes, with canyons connecting the 2-and 3-fold axes. Capsid-spanning channels at the 5-fold axes are unusually wide and may facilitate release of the viral genome, promoting dsRNA-dependent immunoinflammatory responses, as recently shown upon the exposure of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells to either TVV-infected T. vaginalis or purified TVV1 virions. Despite extensive sequence divergence, conservative features of the capsid reveal a helix-rich fold probably derived from an ancestor shared with fungal Totiviridae family members. Also notable are mass spectrometry results assessing the virion proteins as a complement to structure determination, which suggest that translation of the TVV1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in fusion with its capsid protein involves ؊2, and not ؉1, ribosomal frameshifting, an uncommonly found mechanism to date. HIV. It is an extracellular parasite that, in turn, commonly hosts infections with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, trichomonasviruses, which appear to exacerbate disease through signaling of immunoinflammatory responses by human epithelial cells. Here we report the first three-dimensional structure of a trichomonasvirus, which is also the first such structure of any protozoan dsRNA virus; show that it has unusually wide channels at the capsid vertices, with potential for releasing the viral genome and promoting dsRNA-dependent responses by human cells; and provide evidence that it uses ؊2 ribosomal frameshifting, an uncommon mechanism, to translate its RNA polymerase in fusion with its capsid protein. These findings provide both mechanistic and translational insights concerning the role of trichomonasviruses in aggravating disease attributable to T. vaginalis.

c4ced20e05b492ccad0924bd1bb48bd2458b5077	Influenza viruses cause respiratory infections every epidemic season regardless of the patient's age. The aim of this study was to determine the activity of respiratory viruses in the epidemic season 2016/2017 in Poland, with particular emphasis on influenza viruses among people aged over 14. There were 2982 clinical samples taken from patients from four age groups: 15-25, 26-44, 45-64, and 65 years tested under the Sentinel and non-Sentinel surveillance programs. The presence of influenza viruses was confirmed in more than 40% of cases, the predominant type was influenza A virus unsubtyped, followed by subtype A/H3N2/. The results for the four age groups indicate that the highest number of confirmed respiratory viruses was recorded in individuals 65 years of age, slightly less, in the decreasing order, in the age groups 45-64 years, 15-25 years, and 26-44 years. Influenza type B infections were observed only in sporadic cases. Given the epidemiological data, epidemic season 2016/ 2017 was characterized by similar dynamics compared to the previous season in Poland and also in most of the European countries. More than 4 million cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses have been reported in Poland, more than 16,000 hospitalizations, and 25 deaths, of which 20 cases occurred among people 65 years of age in the epidemic season 2016/2017.
d7788ab137f05cf1c247c60dbe388b80fb5764a7	The Spatiotemporal Epidemiologic Modeler (STEM) is an open source software project supported by the Eclipse Foundation and used by a global community of researchers and public health officials working to track and, when possible, control outbreaks of infectious disease in human and animal populations. STEM is not a model or a tool designed for a specific disease; it is a flexible, modular framework supporting exchange and integration of community models, reusable plug-in components, and denominator data, available to researchers worldwide at www.eclipse.org/stem. A review of multiple projects illustrates its capabilities. STEM has been used to study variations in transmission of seasonal influenza in Israel by strains; evaluate social distancing measures taken to curb the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico City; study measles outbreaks in part of London and inform local policy on immunization; and gain insights into H7N9 avian influenza transmission in China. A multistrain dengue fever model explored the roles of the mosquito vector, cross-strain immunity, and antibody response in the frequency of dengue outbreaks. STEM has also been used to study the impact of variations in climate on malaria incidence. During the Ebola epidemic, a weekly conference call supported the global modeling community; subsequent work modeled the impact of behavioral change and tested disease reintroduction via animal reservoirs. Work in Germany tracked salmonella in pork from farm to fork; and a recent doctoral dissertation used the air travel feature to compare the potential threats posed by weaponizing infectious diseases. Current projects include work in Great Britain to evaluate control strategies for parasitic disease in sheep, and in Germany and Hungary, to validate the model and inform policy decisions for African swine fever. STEM Version 4.0.0, released in early 2019, includes tools used in these projects and updates technical aspects of the framework to ease its use and re-use.
f3fcf48435d64507dd0a0c7e8e3bf25f489172f8	Objectives: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has presented clinicians with a difficult therapeutic dilemma. With supportive care as the current mainstay of treatment, the fatality rate of COVID-19 is 6.9%. There are currently several trials assessing the efficacy of different antivirals as treatment. Of these, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have garnered the most attention. Methods: In this study, the literature currently available on CQ and HCQ as treatment of COVID-19 was surveyed using EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and one clinical trial registry. Upon gathering published and preprint trials, risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Results: There are currently seven completed clinical trials and 29 registered clinical trials focusing on HCQ or CQ as a therapeutic avenue for COVID-19. Of these, five of seven trials have shown favorable outcomes for patients using CQ or HCQ and two of seven have shown no change compared to control. However, all seven trials carried varying degrees of bias and poor study design. Conclusion: There are currently not enough data available to support the routine use of HCQ and CQ as therapies for COVID-19. Pending further results from more extensive studies with more stringent study parameters, clinicians should defer from routine use of HCQ and CQ. There are several clinical trials currently under way with results expected soon.

Abstract-The proteolytic processing of polyproteins by the 3CL protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is essential for the viral propagation. A series of tripeptide a,b-unsaturated esters and ketomethylene isosteres, including AG7088, are synthesized and assayed to target the 3CL protease. Though AG7088 is inactive (IC 50 > 100 lM), the ketomethylene isosteres and tripeptide a,b-unsaturated esters containing both P1 and P2 phenylalanine residues show modest inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 11-39 lM). The Phe-Phe dipeptide inhibitors 18a-e are designed on the basis of computer modeling of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The most potent inhibitor 18c with an inhibition constant of 0.52 lM is obtained by condensation of the Phe-Phe dipeptide a,bunsaturated ester with 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamic acid. The cell-based assays also indicate that 18c is a nontoxic anti-SARS agent with an EC 50 value of 0.18 lM.
b587e795a806226c75fa4d9c0a577b63c5f49f04	The broad immunomodulatory properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has allowed for wide application in regenerative medicine as well as immune/inflammatory diseases, including unmatched allogeneic use. The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has unleashed a pandemic in record time accompanied by an alarming mortality rate mainly due to pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since there are no effective preventive or curative therapies currently, MSC therapy (MSCT) has emerged as a possible candidate despite the lack of preclinical data of MSCs for COVID-19. Interestingly, MSCT preclinical data specifically on immune/inflammatory disorders of the lungs were among the earliest to be reported in 2003, with the first clinical use of MSCT for graft-vs-host disease reported in 2004. Since these first reports, preclinical data showing beneficial effects of MSC immunomodulation have accumulated substantially, and as a consequence, over a third of MSCT clinical trials now target immune/inflammatory diseases. There is much preclinical evidence for MSCT in noninfectious-including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-as well as infectious bacterial immune/inflammatory lung disorders, with data generally demonstrating therapeutic effects; however, for infectious viral pulmonary conditions, the preclinical evidence is more scarce with some inconsistent outcomes. In this article,

Whereas the kinetics of the splenic antiviral response are conventional, i.e. expansion followed by a rapid drop in the frequency of speci®c CD8 T cells, dengue virus-speci®c CD8 T cells are retained in the CNS at a high frequency. These CD8 T cells display a partially activated phenotype (CD69 high , Ly-6A/E high , CD62L low ), characteristic for effector-memory T cells. CD43 expression, visualized by staining with the 1B11 mAb, decreased in time, suggesting that these persisting CD8 T cells differentiated into memory cells. These data add to the growing evidence implicating the CNS as a non-lymphoid tissue capable of supporting prolonged T cell survival/maintenance.
ab7e846fb15ceb1ad0f91c9c6995acbf01cf29ad	Sharing of notations and theories across an inheritance hierarchy of mathematical structures, e.g., groups and rings, is important for productivity when formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. The packed classes methodology is a generic design pattern to define and combine mathematical structures in a dependent type theory with records. When combined with mechanisms for implicit coercions and unification hints, packed classes enable automated structure inference and subtyping in hierarchies, e.g., that a ring can be used in place of a group. However, large hierarchies based on packed classes are challenging to implement and maintain. We identify two hierarchy invariants that ensure modularity of reasoning and predictability of inference with packed classes, and propose algorithms to check these invariants. We implement our algorithms as tools for the Coq proof assistant, and show that they significantly improve the development process of Mathematical Components, a library for formalized mathematics.
62b7f419bb3a4af2f439778b85c0b2582461053a	Nucleoli are the prominent contrasted structures of the cell nucleus. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs are synthesized, processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins. RNA polymerase I synthesizes the ribosomal RNAs and this activity is cell cycle regulated. The nucleolus reveals the functional organization of the nucleus in which the compartmentation of the diVerent steps of ribosome biogenesis is observed whereas the nucleolar machineries are in permanent exchange with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear bodies. After mitosis, nucleolar assembly is a time and space regulated process controlled by the cell cycle. In addition, by generating a large volume in the nucleus with apparently no RNA polymerase II activity, the nucleolus creates a domain of retention/sequestration of molecules normally active outside the nucleolus. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. The nucleolus is also a sensor of stress due to the redistribution of the ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm by nucleolus disruption. The nucleolus plays several crucial functions in the nucleus: in addition to its function as ribosome factory of the cells it is a multifunctional nuclear domain, and nucleolar activity is linked with several pathologies. Perspectives on the evolution of this research area are proposed.
14f67b5a1fd17a242532cf8f0bf6641478f8abb0	This study aims to understand how spatial structures, the interconnections between counties, matter in understanding COVID-19 period prevalence across the US. We assemble a county-level dataset that contains COVID-19 confirmed cases through June 28, 2020 and various sociodemographic measures from multiple sources. In addition to an aspatial regression model, we conduct spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial autoregressive combined models to systematically examine the role of spatial structure in shaping geographical disparities in COVID-19 period prevalence. The aspatial ordinary least squares regression model tends to overestimate the COVID-19 period prevalence among counties with low observed rates, but this issue can be effectively addressed by spatial modeling. Spatial models can better estimate the period prevalence for counties, especially along the Atlantic coasts and through the Black Belt. Overall, the model fit among counties along both coasts is generally good with little variability evident, but in the Plain states, model fit is conspicuous in its heterogeneity across counties. Spatial models can help partially explain the geographic disparities in COVID-19 period prevalence. These models reveal spatial variability in model fit including identifying regions of the country where fit is heterogeneous and worth closer attention in the immediate short term.
61365f253674c66dbb94d976e6945b9a68b4d273	To investigate the association between use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) and outcomes of hypertensive COVID-19 patients, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. We systematically searched PubMed, EuropePMC, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central Databases using the terms "(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme OR angiotensin receptor blocker)". The primary and second outcomes were mortality (non-survivor) and severe COVID-19, respectively. Totally, 7410 patients were included from 15 studies. Pooled analysis showed that the use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with mortality (OR 0.73 [0.38, 1.40], p=0.34; I 2 : 81%) and severity (OR 1.03 [0.73, 1.45], p=0.87; I 2 : 65%). Pooled adjusted OR showed no risk/benefit associated with ACEI/ARB use in terms of mortality (OR 0.83 [0.54, 1.27], p=0.38; I 2 : 0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the use of ARB was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.51 [0.29, 0.90], p = 0.02; I 2 : 22%) but not ACEI subgroup (OR 0.68 [0.39, 1.17], p = 0.16; I 2 : 0%). Meta-regression showed that the association between ACEI/ARB use and mortality in patients with COVID-19 do not varies by gender (p=0.104). GRADE showed a very low 6 certainty of evidence for effect of ACEI/ARB on mortality and severity. The certainty of evidence was very low for ACEI and ARB subgroups. Administration of a renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, was not associated with increased mortality or severity of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. Specifically, ARB and not ACEI use, was associated with lower mortality. The use of RAS inhibitor did not increase/decrease mortality in patients with Subgroup analysis for ARB showed reduced mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 The certainty of evidence was very low and randomized controlled trials are still required

577ff5b5b67f3367ba8ee8f469983f6270c0c8ee	J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights  A large population-representative was surveyed to better understand COVID-19related psychopathology.  We developed and validated the COVID Stress Scales, comprising 36 items on 5 scales.  The COVID Stress Scales offer promise for identifying people in need of pandemicrelated mental health services. Research and clinical observations suggest that during times of pandemic many people exhibit stress-or anxiety-related psychopathology that include fear of becoming infected, fear of coming into contact with possibly contaminated objects or surfaces, fear of foreigners who might be carrying infection (i.e., disease-related xenophobia), fear of the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic, compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking regarding possible pandemic-related threats, and traumatic stress symptoms about the pandemic (e.g., nightmares, intrusive thoughts). We developed the 36-item COVID Stress Scales (CSS) to measure these features, as they pertain to COVID-19. The CSS were developed to better understand and assess COVID-19-related psychopathology. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. The CSS were developed and initially validated in population-representative samples from Canada (N=3,479) and the United States (N=3,375). A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to scales assessing COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking, and (5) traumatic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 COVID Stress Scales stress symptoms about COVID-19. The scales performed well on various indices of reliability and validity. The scales were intercorrelated, providing evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome. The scales offer promise as tools for better understanding the psychopathology associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services.
ca9cf0e9944de44362d7464ef6eccac41b97a118	Since the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 2280 confirmed human infections and 800 associated deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization. MERS-CoV is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family. MERS-CoV infection leads to a variety of clinical outcomes in humans ranging from asymptomatic and mild infection to severe acute lung injury and multi-organ failure and death. To study the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection and development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for MERS, a number of genetically modified mouse models have been developed, including various versions of transgenic mice expressing the human DPP4 viral receptor. Tracking and quantifying viral infection, among others, in permissive hosts is a key endpoint for studying MERS pathogenesis and evaluating the efficacy of selected MCMs developed for MERS. In addition to quantifying infectious progeny virus which requires highcontainment biosafety level (BSL)-3 laboratory, here we outlined an established real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-based procedure to unequivocally quantify MERS-CoV-specific RNAs within the lungs of infected human DPP4 (hDPP4, transgenic (hDPP4 Tg) mice under a standard BSL-2 laboratory.

5e15233d1866349aee27a3feaeb00c8099984fbe	An ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the correlation between air pollution, and COVID-19 cases and fatality rates in London. The analysis demonstrated a strong correlation (R 2 >0.7) between increment in air pollution and an increase in the risk of COVID-19 transmission within London boroughs. Particularly, strong correlations (R 2 >0.72) between the risk of COVID-19 15 fatality and NO2 and PM2.5 pollution concentrations were also found. Although this study assumed the same level of air pollution across a particular London borough, it demonstrates the possibility to employ air pollution as an indicator to rapidly identify the city's vulnerable regions. Such an approach can inform the decisions to suspend or reduce the operation of different public transport modes within a city. The methodology and learnings from the study can thus aid in public 20 transport's response to COVID-19 outbreak by adopting different levels of human-mobility reduction strategies based on the vulnerability of a given region.

52ab5a88deeaf66cac9068488b1acfff454eea2f	Aims: COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. At the time of survey, fewer than 150 children in Australia and New Zealand had documented infection. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes, readiness and confidence in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic through an online survey of paediatric physicians and sub-specialists across Australia and New Zealand. Methods: Multiple email list groups were used to contact paediatric physicians to undertake an online Likert scale survey between 17 and 24 March. Respondents' specialty, experience and work setting were recorded. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine respondent factors. Results: There were 542 respondents from across Australia and New Zealand: an estimated 11% of the paediatric physician workforce. A minority (36.6%) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated; the majority (92.7%) agreed that senior-level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously. Most reported a good understanding of the natural history of COVID-19 in children, and knowledge of where to find local information. A large proportion of physicians (86.1%) were worried about becoming infected through their work; few (5.8%) reported that they would not come to work to avoid infection. Closure of school and childcares would reduce the ability to continue work at current capacity for 23.6% of respondents. Conclusion: Despite limited experience in pandemics, most paediatric physicians felt informed. Concern about exposure at work is common; most were willing to work regardless. The closure of schools and daycares may have an impact on staffing. Coordination and leadership will be critical.
6435c0a4110baa3e744bd194ec02d26b2eed6fb4	We report very low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in two San Francisco Bay Area populations. 44 Seropositivity was 0.26% in 387 hospitalized patients admitted for non-respiratory indications 45 and 0.1% in 1,000 blood donors. We additionally describe the longitudinal dynamics of 46 immunoglobulin-G, immunoglobulin-M, and in vitro neutralizing antibody titers in COVID-19 47 patients. Neutralizing antibodies rise in tandem with immunoglobulin levels following symptom 48 onset, exhibiting median time to seroconversion within one day of each other, and there is >93% 49 positive percent agreement between detection of immunoglobulin-G and neutralizing titers. 50 51 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory illness caused by the severe acute 52 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1 . The symptoms of COVID-19 range from 53 asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death, and the COVID-19 54 pandemic has resulted in substantial burdens on healthcare systems worldwide 2,3 . Given the 55 current state of diagnostic testing which largely relies on molecular techniques, the 56 seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in different populations remains unclear. 57 Accurate and large-scale serologic testing that includes detection of neutralizing antibodies is 58 essential in evaluating spread of infection in the community, informing public health 59 containment efforts, and identifying donors for convalescent plasma therapy trials. We first assessed the performance of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (FDA 64 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)) and IgM (prototype) assays from a cohort of five 65 outpatients and 38 hospitalized patients at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) 66 Medical Center and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs (SFVA) Health Care System. These 67 assays are chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays that target the nucleocapsid and spike 68 proteins, respectively. All patients received care at adult inpatient units or clinics and were RT-69 PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab testing (Figure 70 1A, Table S1). The percentage of patients seroconverting for IgG at weekly time intervals 71 following reported symptom onset reached 94.4% at ≥ 22 days (Figure 1B). Correspondingly, 72 IgG assay sensitivity from analysis of all 423 samples increased weekly to reach 96.9% at ≥ 22 73 days, and was 99% when samples from seven immunocompromised patients (see below) were 74 excluded (Figure 1D, Table 1). The percentage of patients seroconverting for IgM was also 75 94.4% at ≥ 22 days (Figure 1E) and IgM assay sensitivity from analysis of 346 samples was 76 97.9% (98.9% with immunocompromised patients excluded) (Figure 1G, Table 1). 77 Of the four patients who had not seroconverted for IgG by the end of 14 days (Figure 78 1B), two were kidney transplant recipients on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 79 immunosuppressive therapy; one was >90 years old; and one was an asymptomatic patient 80 receiving acute psychiatric care who provided an unreliable history. Both renal transplant 81 recipients were observed to ultimately seroconvert for IgG and IgM. Notably, delayed 82 seroconversion for IgG and IgM was not universal in immunosuppressed patients: three 83 additional solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients on tacrolimus and MMF, as well as one patient 84 with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and infliximab, all seroconverted within two weeks. A 85 further SOT recipient was positive for IgG and IgM in the earliest available serum sample from 86 day 17 post symptom onset (Figure 2D, E) . We did not have samples beyond day 18 for the 87 remaining two patients. However, as seroconversion was observed as late as three weeks after 88 symptom onset (Figure 2D, E) , it is possible that analysis of later samples would have 89 demonstrated detectable antibodies in their serum. The one patient who was still IgG negative in 90 the 22+ day time frame (Figure 1B) (from a plasma sample collected on day 29) had only mild 91 symptoms and was positive by IgM and neutralizing antibody testing (described below). tested for IgG (n=1,013) and IgM (n=1,492) seroreactivity. Two samples out of 1,013 were 98 positive by IgG testing, yielding a specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.3-100%) (Figure 1C), 99 concordant with the 99.9% specificity reported in a study by the University of Washington 4,5 . 100 Similarly, testing of 235 remnant plasma samples from 163 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative UCSF 101 patients collected from late March to early April 2020 resulted in detection of only one positive 102 sample, yielding a specificity of 99.6% (95% CI: 97.7-100%) (Figure 1H). The IgG positive 103 sample was from a patient admitted for syncope but who reported a cough of one-month 104 duration, suggesting a potential prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. Six samples out of 1,492 from 105 US blood donors were positive by IgM testing, yielding a specificity of 99.6% (95% CI: 99.2-106 99.9%) (Figure 1F) . This was consistent with more limited testing of 39 SARS-CoV-2 PCR 107 negative UCSF patients, none of whom were positive for IgM antibody ( Figure 1I) . Thus, the 108 Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assays demonstrated high sensitivity (96.9%-97.9% at ≥ 22 109 days in a primarily hospitalized patient cohort) and specificity (99.6-99.8% in pre-COVID blood 110 donors), with good correlation (rho = 0.65) between IgG anti-nucleocapsid protein and IgM anti-111 spike protein seropositivity (Figure 2A) .
85733c6036a832655e4b68713eac8c5ee0fff1c1	A safe and durable vaccine is urgently needed to tackle the COVID19 pandemic that has infected >15 million people and caused >620,000 deaths worldwide. As with other respiratory pathogens, the nasal compartment is the first barrier that needs to be breached by the SARS-CoV-2 virus before dissemination to the lung. Despite progress at remarkable speed, current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. We report the development of an intranasal subunit vaccine that contains the trimeric or monomeric spike protein and liposomal STING agonist as adjuvant. This vaccine induces systemic neutralizing antibodies, mucosal IgA responses in the lung and nasal compartments, and T-cell responses in the lung of mice. Single-cell RNA-sequencing confirmed the concomitant activation of T and B cell responses in a germinal center-like manner within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT), confirming its role as an inductive site that can lead to long-lasting immunity. The ability to elicit immunity in the respiratory tract has can prevent the initial establishment of infection in individuals and prevent disease transmission across humans.
0333b149fa1bad7b40013227fa125d7a90745265	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Governments have implemented combinations of 'lockdown' measures of various stringencies, including school and workplace closures, cancellations of public events, and restrictions on internal and external movements. These policy interventions are an attempt to shield high risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries' healthcare systems, or, colloquially, 'flatten the curve'. However, these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. These policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre-existing inequities, but also generate new ones. We developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorise adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures. We based our framework on Lorenc and Oliver's framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. To test its application we purposively sampled COVID-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical, psychological, and social harms, as well as opportunity costs, in each of the PROGRESS-Plus equity domains: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, and disability). We found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each COVID-19 lockdown policy example, stratified by LMIC and HIC, in every PROGRESS-Plus equity domain. We identified known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects. The same harms (anxiety; depression; food insecurity; loneliness; stigma; violence) appear to be repeated across many groups, and are exacerbated by several COVID-19 policy interventions. Conclusion: Our conceptual framework highlights the fact that COVID-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms. Applying this framework can help in three ways: (1) identifying areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects; (2) mitigating policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence; and (3) planning for lifting COVID-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world. categories with the remaining four adverse effects domains: direct health harms, psychological harms, group and social harms, and opportunity cost harms. This approach allowed us to (1) identify relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature of previously known inequities and emerging evidence of the impacts of the lockdown measures, (2) conceptualise how specific measures may exacerbate, or lead to, inequities, and (3) relate these considerations to potential mitigation measures. Conceptual frameworks represent a network of interlinked concepts in a particular area. They can provide a structure for understanding a phenomenon or subject.(13) Polit and Beck asserted that frameworks can in fact make research more comprehensible, and generalisable. (14) They are a way to bring together many components on a complex topic, such as COVID-19 related inequity. We drew from the literature on health equity impact assessments (HEIA) to develop and complete a 'proof-of-concept' framework. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health highlights the importance of undertaking HEIAs during policy development.(15) We iteratively and reflexively developed our framework to cover two dimensions: 1) socially-stratifying equity factors, and 2) types of harms. These frameworks were developed iteratively through application and testing in systematic reviews, epidemiologic studies, and policy analyses.(4,9,12) After testing our framework on emergent reports of COVID-19 equity harms, we refined it to capture policies (rather than programmes); to function on disparate geopolitical levels; and to capture mitigation strategies. (16) After we developed the framework, we purposively selected from the many emergent reports of COVID-19 policy interventions causing equity harms to demonstrate the application of the framework. We searched the peer-reviewed and emergent COVID-19 literature to identify pre-existing evidence on inequities related to the specific harms associated with a particular lockdown policy. We conceptualised the interplay between a given policy, and its equity harms, by drawing upon this literature, and through expert consultation and consensus discussions. We identified examples of ongoing efforts to mitigate the inequity effects generated by the lockdown measures through expert consultation with the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group. Systematic review of the literature was not performed given (1) the examples were intended to be illustrative but not exhaustive, (2) ongoing research and evaluation is needed to measure actual equity harms, and (3) the need to provide evidence-informed but timely tools in the context of a rapidly evolving situation to draw attention to inequities. We included examples of COVID-19 policies to demonstrate how the new framework could be used. We purposively selected our examples of policy interventions from emergent COVID-19 literature and media reports to cover: each WHO region, a range of lenient to stricter policies, one LMIC and HIC example per PROGRESS-Plus domain, and measures being monitored by the Oxford COVID-19 policy tracker.(2) We applied our framework to each COVID-19 policy case study.

Lactogenic immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine induced by the attenuated Nouzilly strain of TGE virus: passive protection of piglets and detection of serum and milk antibody classes by ELISA. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol., 24: 37-47. Piglets of eight sows vaccinated by different routes with the attenuated TGE mutant coronavirus, Nouzilly (N) strain, and piglets from two field seropositive sows were challenged with a virulent TGE strain. On the day of challenge and 10 days after challenge, milk and serum samples from sows were analysed for their level of neutralizing antibodies, total immunoglobulin classes and TGE antibody classes by an ELISA. No direct relationship was seen between the level of protection of the litters and the titres of the different antibody classes on the day of challenge. However, an inverse correlation was seen 10 days after challenge between protection and the level of TGE antibodies.
9d25506a4a2348f56c497d0fb4e247d2096b4a46	To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID19) total lockdown is in place in India from 24 th March 2020 for 21 days. In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the duration of the lockdown on glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library. A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets & diabetes-related complications. The predictive model was extremely robust (R2=0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown upto 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% & 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections. The duration of lockdown is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. Such increase in diabetes-related complications will put additional load on overburdened healthcare system, and also increase COVID19 infections in patients with such uncontrolled glycemia.
5c761b6013f53f9a59d3ed5a360c6dbf51a0e6d5	Background: Intraoperative mechanical ventilation may influence postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Current practice during thoracic surgery is not well described. Methods: This is a post-hoc analysis of the prospective multicenter cross-sectional LAS VEGAS study focusing on patients who underwent thoracic surgery. Consecutive adult patients receiving invasive ventilation during general anesthesia were included in a one-week period in 2013. Baseline characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative data were registered. PPCs were collected as composite endpoint until the 5th postoperative day. Patients were stratified into groups based on the use of one lung ventilation (OLV) or two lung ventilation (TLV), endoscopic vs. non-endoscopic approach and ARISCAT score risk for PPCs. Differences between subgroups were compared using χ 2 or Fisher exact tests or Student's t-test. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative probability of development of PPC and hospital discharge were performed. Cox-proportional hazard models without adjustment for covariates were used to assess the effect of the subgroups on outcome. (Continued on next page) Results: From 10,520 patients enrolled in the LAS VEGAS study, 302 patients underwent thoracic procedures and were analyzed. There were no differences in patient characteristics between OLV vs. TLV, or endoscopic vs. open surgery. Patients received V T of 7.4 ± 1.6 mL/kg, a PEEP of 3.5 ± 2.4 cmH 2 O, and driving pressure of 14.4 ± 4.6 cmH 2 O. Compared with TLV, patients receiving OLV had lower V T and higher peak, plateau and driving pressures, higher PEEP and respiratory rate, and received more recruitment maneuvers. There was no difference in the incidence of PPCs in OLV vs. TLV or in endoscopic vs. open procedures. Patients at high risk had a higher incidence of PPCs compared with patients at low risk (48.1% vs. 28.9%; hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% CI 1.05-3.61; p = 0.033). There was no difference in the incidence of severe PPCs. The in-hospital length of stay (LOS) was longer in patients who developed PPCs. Patients undergoing OLV, endoscopic procedures and at low risk for PPC had shorter LOS. Conclusion: PPCs occurred frequently and prolonged hospital LOS following thoracic surgery. Proportionally large tidal volumes and high driving pressure were commonly used in this sub-population. However, large RCTs are needed to confirm these findings. Trial registration: This trial was prospectively registered at the Clinical Trial Register (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT016 01223;
dcd7ba50d2dd32e9237d69e920ce1c4fa91f4df9	Porcine deltacoronavirus (δ-CoV) is the object of extensive research in several countries including the United States. In contrast, the epidemiology of δ-CoVs in wild birds in the US is largely unknown. Our aim was to comparatively assess the prevalence of δand γ-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin. A total of 1236 cloacal/fecal swabs collected during the period 2015-2018 were tested for γand δ-CoVs using genus-specific reverse transcription-PCR assays. A total of 61 (4.99%) samples were γ-CoV positive, with up to 29 positive samples per state. In contrast, only 14 samples were positive for δ-CoV (1.14%) with only 1-4 originating from the same state. Thus, unlike previous reports from Asia, γ-CoVs are more prevalent than δ-CoVs in the US, suggesting that δ-CoVs may spread in birds with lower efficiency. This may indicate δ-CoV emerging status and incomplete adaptation to new host species limiting its spread. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial N gene revealed that the newly identified δ-CoV strains were most closely related to the HKU20 (wigeon) strain. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of aquatic bird δ-CoVs in the epidemiology of δ-CoVs in swine and terrestrial birds. Viruses 2019, 11, 897 2 of 11 and mammals including pigs [4] . Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) emerged in the US in 2014 as a new enteropathogenic CoV causing diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in economic losses to the swine industry [4, 5] . Its origin is unknown, but it is hypothesized that it may have spilled over from an avian host. δ-CoV and γ-CoV are co-circulating in wild avian species, but their epidemiology (prevalence and diversity) differ [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In a screening study of 918 wild Australian birds, 141 of them tested positive for CoVs. After sequencing, δ-CoV was detected in pacific black ducks, curlew sandpiper, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, and pied herons [6] . However, γ-CoV (80% of sequenced samples) was identified more frequently than δ-CoV (20% of sequenced samples) [6] . γ-CoV was also detected in quails and pheasants in Italy [7] . RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) analyses found that quail were also infected with δ-CoV [7]. Wild birds harbor genetically diverse δ-CoV with some of them potentially transmittable to pigs [8] . A previous report from Brazil showed that δ-CoVs were detected in two species of wild terrestrial birds, purple-breasted-parrot and plain parakeet. These avian CoVs were monophyletically related to CoVs from Sparrow (SPaCoV HKU19) and swine (PorCoV HKU15), which were also found to be δ-CoV. This information supports the hypothesis that δ-CoV can cross inter-species barriers, with the potential to transmit from birds to swine [8] . Previous studies of CoVs in Hong Kong reported three novel CoVs in bulbuls (BuCoV HKU11), thrushes (ThCoV HKU12) and munias (MuCoV HKU13), which were hypothesized to belong to the novel genus δ-CoV [9]. These three novel δ-CoVs clustered with a δ-CoV detected in Asian leopard cats [10]; however, further studies are necessary to understand interspecies transmission from birds [9]. In a surveillance study in Hong Kong and Cambodia, δ-CoVs were found in different wild aquatic birds: gray herons, pond herons, great cormorants, black-faced spoonbills, and several duck species [11] . δ-CoVs do not cause severe illness in birds, leading to their endemic nature in the avian population [11] . In a screening study for δ-CoVs in China, none were found in Asian leopard cats, bats, domestic cats, cattle, chickens, dogs, humans, monkeys, and rodents [12] . The investigators discovered seven novel δ-CoVs in pigs and wild birds (white-eye, sparrow, magpie robin, night heron, wigeon, and common moorhen) [12] . Genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis showed that avian and swine δ-CoVs had similar genome characteristics and structures [12] . Similarly, a recent study in the US described a novel sparrow δ-CoV that clustered together with PDCoV [13] and other terrestrial, but aquatic bird δ-CoVs. In Brazil, screening revealed the presence of CoVs in vinaceous-breasted amazon and plain parakeet, that were closely related to δ-CoVs from birds (SpaCoV HKU17) and swine (PorCoV). This emphasizes the increased risk for direct interspecies transmission and that in contrast to waterfowl, terrestrial birds may act as intermediate hosts and are commonly found in the sites of bird-swine co-mingling [8]. In Finland, two different avian δ-CoV strains from lesser black-backed gull and black-headed gull were detected which shared 83% and 85% nucleotide identity with avian and mammalian δ-CoVs, respectively [14] . In summary, recently identified δ-CoVs are emerging globally that possess high genetic and antigenic plasticity. Porcine δ-CoV is being studied extensively in the US and elsewhere [4, 5] . In contrast, the diversity and epidemiology of δ-CoVs in wild birds in the US are largely unknown. The association of porcine δ-CoV with enteric disease in pigs and its continuous spread underscore an urgent need to further investigate the mechanisms of its persistence and spread. Extensive epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate δ-CoV prevalence in avian species, swine farms, pig-bird comingling sites and high pig-traffic sites such as abattoirs, assembly yards and truck washes. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of δand γ-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

d8a4109ac8947b1e80df71baa59c1689e801a2d5	The leader RNA of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of coronaviral genomes contains two stem-loop structures denoted SL1 and SL2. Herein, we show that SL1 is functionally and structurally bipartite. While the upper region of SL1 is required to be paired, we observe strong genetic selection against viruses that contain a deletion of A35, an extrahelical nucleotide that destabilizes SL1, in favor of genomes that contain a diverse panel of destabilizing second-site mutations, due to introduction of a non-canonical base pair near A35. Viruses containing destabilizing SL1-ΔA35 mutations also contain one of two specific mutations in the 3' UTR. Thermal denaturation and imino proton solvent exchange experiments reveal that the lower half of SL1 is unstable and that second-site SL1-ΔA35 substitutions are characterized by one or more features of the wild-type SL1. We propose a "dynamic SL1" model, in which the base of SL1 has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the 5' and 3' UTRs that stimulates subgenomic RNA synthesis. Although not conserved at the nucleotide sequence level, these general structural characteristics of SL1 appear to be conserved in other coronaviral genomes.
f19698201bf931ac46df8cd329c9b1d5fc4f15fc	Long-term endemicity of avian H5N1 influenza virus in poultry and continuous sporadic human infections in several countries has raised the concern of another potential pandemic influenza. Suspicion of the avian origin of the previous pandemics results in the close investigation of the mechanism of interspecies transmission. Entry and fusion is the first step for the H5N1 influenza virus to get into the host cells affecting the host ranges. Therefore receptor usage study has been a major focus for the last few years. We now know the difference of the sialic acid structures and distributions in different spe- cies, even in the different parts of the same host. Many host factors interacting with the influenza virus component proteins have been identified and their role in the host range expansion and interspecies transmission is under detailed scrutiny. Here we review current progress in the receptor usage and host factors. H5N1 influenza virus, interspecies transmission, virus adaptation, host factors
cde52b2daa66b1437cb99d53d55236a225ab4dd7	The purpose of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of adding nebulized antibiotics to systemic antimicrobials in critically ill patients with respiratory tract infections (pneumonia or tracheobronchitis) and the effect on renal function. A retrospective observational cohort study including critically ill patients with respiratory tract infections during a 2-year period was conducted. Intervention group included patients that received nebulized and systemic antimicrobials. Patients in the control group received only systemic antimicrobials. Clinical resolution was the primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes included change in fever, inflammatory parameters, and creatinine clearance; length of hospital stay, systemic therapy, and mechanical ventilation; hospital readmission; and mortality. Regression models were performed to estimate the effect of nebulized antibiotics on outcome variables adjusted by potential confounders. A total of 136 patients were included (93 in control group and 43 in intervention group). The intervention group had higher odds of clinical resolution (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 7.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.2, 43.3). Nebulized antibiotic therapy was independently associated with reduction in procalcitonin (adjusted OR: 12.4; 95% CI: 1.4, 109.7). There were no significant differences in the rest of the secondary outcomes or in creatinine clearance reduction. Adding nebulized antibiotics for the management of respiratory tract infections has a positive impact on clinical resolution without increasing the risk of renal toxicity.
05739a046083f4487662b8729ad28691a225c23e	The Variable Size and Cost Bin Packing Problem (VSCBPP) consists of minimizing the cost of all bins used to pack a set of items without exceeding the bins capacities. It is a well known NP-Hard problem with many practical applications. In this contribution we assume that the capacity of a bin can be understood in a flexible way (so it may allow some overload) thus leading to a fuzzy version of the VSCBPP with fuzzy constraints. We solve the proposed fuzzy VSCBPP by using the parametric approach based on α-cuts, thus defining a set of related crisp problems. By using three different solving algorithms and several instances, we explore the impact of different degrees of relaxation not only in terms of cost, but also in the structure of the solutions.
12adb19fc0e417f81387da0371171232ae2a0244	SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, particularly those preventing viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) interaction with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, could offer protective immunity, and may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 625 serial plasma samples from 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 170 SARS-CoV-2infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Severely ill patients developed significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. The development of plasma antibodies was correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, consistent with potential humoral immune clearance of virus. Using a novel competition ELISA, we detected antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interactions in 68% of inpatients and 40% of outpatients tested. Cross-reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV RBD were found almost exclusively in hospitalized patients. Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 decreased within 2 months, suggesting that humoral protection may be short-lived.
9e1e660682dbad673cb001d7556e1af24a83e781	Coronavirus has been in a global pandemic currently and relating symptoms were reported variously around the world. We reported a previously healthy man of COVID-19 presenting with anosmia as the obvious symptom with relevant radiological findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging.
daf33a68848e97ccce919dd77c627fccc1daee9b	Porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) and type 2 (PCV2) are two genotypes of porcine circovirus. Both of them are presumed to be widespread in the swine population. Currently, there is no specific treatment for their infections. RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific RNA degradation mechanism mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), which represents a possible therapeutic application for the treatment of viral infections. In this study, three siRNA expression plasmids (pS-RepA, pS-RepB and pS-RepC) were generated to target three different coding regions of the Rep protein (Rep) of PCV. These siRNAs were used to inhibit PCV production in a porcine kidney cell line, PK-15 cells. Our results revealed that Rep gene expression was inhibited by pS-RepA, pS-RepB and pS-RepC to different degrees. Moreover, our study also showed that the production of PCV1 and PCV2 was reduced by these siRNAs. pS-RepC, which targets the middle region of Rep gene, proved to be the most efficient siRNA for inhibition of Rep expression and viral production. Taken together, our data suggest that RNAi could be investigated as a potential treatment for PCV infection. #
88a0b7d6447839c09069588d1761364ce9045d61	Background: Within the genera Chlamydia, the development of refined diagnostic techniques has allowed the identification of four species that are capable of infecting pigs. The epidemiology, clinical, and zoonotic impacts of these species are however largely unknown. The study aimed to investigate the presence of Chlamydia spp. in the intestines of growing pigs and in conjunctival swabs from finisher pigs, and relate the findings to clinical signs. Results: By histology, 20 of 48 pigs had intestinal lesions that may be consistent with chlamydial infection. By PCR, forty-six of the pigs were positive whereas two samples were inhibited. Sequencing of 19 DNA extracts identified these as Chlamydia suis. By immunohistochemistry, 32 of 44 samples were positive and a significant relationship was detected between macroscopically visible intestinal lesions and a high degree of infection. By real-time PCR, a significant difference was detected between pigs with and without conjunctivitis when a Ct value of 36 was employed but not when a Ct value of 38 was employed. Conclusions: Chlamydia suis was demonstrated in most samples and overall, no correlation to clinical signs was detected. However, a correlation was noted between samples with a high degree of infection and the presence of clinical signs. It is possible, that the intensive pig production systems studied might predispose for the transmission and maintenance of the infection thus increasing the infectious load and the risk for disease in the pig.
c3c5b25cd70f8f07b93dca86e5f1de271c6e8017	Background: On January 30, COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern-a week after Singapore's first imported case and 5 days before local transmission. The National University Hospital (NUH) is Singapore's third largest hospital with 1200 beds, heavy clinical workloads, and major roles in research and teaching. Main body: With memories of SARS still vivid, there was an urgent requirement for the NUH Division of Infectious Diseases to adapt-undergoing major reorganization to face rapidly changing priorities while ensuring usual essential services and standards. Leveraging on individual strengths, our division mobilized to meet the demands of COVID-19 while engaging in high-level coordination, strategy, and advocacy. We present our experience of the 60 days since the nation's first case. During this time, our hospital has managed 3030 suspect cases, including 1300 inpatients, 37 confirmed cases, and overseen 4384 samples tested for COVID-19. Conclusion: Complex hospital adaptations were supported by an unprecedented number of workflows and coordination channels essential to safe and effective operations. The actions we describe, aligned with international recommendations and emerging evidence-based best practices, may serve as a framework for other divisions and institutions facing the spread of COVID-19 globally.
df9ae7874d92db3e29781f67fc10358247fd8c0d	The large size of the coronavirus (CoV) genome (around 30 kb) and the instability in bacteria of plasmids carrying CoV replicase sequences represent serious restrictions for the development of CoV infectious clones using reverse genetic systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense RNA viruses. To overcome these problems, several approaches have been established in the last 13 years. Here we describe the engineering of CoV full-length cDNA clones as bacterial artifi cial chromosomes (BACs), using the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) as a model.
d1b29169d6de340c519e75124d191609ba1a7bbb	 34/37 studies showed at least one measure of SEM associated with overdose  Associations of health insurance, income, education, incarceration, social support, and SES with overdose were significant in most studies J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f  Marginalization is associated with added precarity and risk for people who use opioids  Initiatives aiming to decrease SEM are a necessary part of combatting overdose Abstract Socioeconomic marginalization (SEM) is an important but under-explored determinant of opioid overdose with important implications for health equity and associated public policy initiatives. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the role of SEM in both fatal and non-fatal overdose among people who use opioids. Studies published between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2018 were identified through searching electronic databases, citations, and by contacting experts. The titles, abstracts, citation information, and descriptor terms of citations were screened by two team members. Data were synthesized using the lumping technique. A total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review, with 34 of 37 finding a significant association between at least one socioeconomic factor and overdose. The included studies contained variables related to eight socioeconomic factors: criminal justice system involvement, income, employment, social support, health insurance, housing/homelessness, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f education, and composite measures of socio-economic status. Most studies found associations in the hypothesized direction, whereby increased SEM was associated with a higher rate or increased likelihood of the overdose outcome measured. The review revealed an underdeveloped evidence base. Nearly all reviewed studies found a connection between a socioeconomic variable and overdose, but more research is needed with an explicit focus on SEM, using robust and nuanced measures that capture multiple dimensions of disadvantage, and collect data over time to better inform decision making around opioid overdose.

35216abe0a88edda40c6249dd732c68d60dc9e8c	The potential for environmental and occupational exposures of populations to nanomaterials (NMs) has fostered concerns of associated adverse health effects, with a particular emphasis on pulmonary injury and disease. Many studies have revealed that several types of NMs can evoke a variety of biological responses, such as pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress, which contribute to allergy, fibrosis, and granuloma formation. Less attention has been paid to health effects that may result from exposure to NMs and additional stressors such as pathogens, with a particular focus on susceptibility to viral infection. This chapter will summarize the current body of literature related to NMs and viral exposures with a primary focus on immune modulation. A summary of the studies performed and major findings to date will be discussed, highlighting proposed molecular mechanisms behind NM-driven host susceptibility, challenges, limitations, and future research needs. Specific mechanisms discussed include direct interaction between NMs and biological molecules, activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and related signaling pathways, production of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammasome activation, and modulation of lipid signaling networks.
802c4e9e532b2a48928179795754847a229252ec	Background: The genus Orthobornavirus comprises non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses able to infect humans, mammals, reptiles and various birds. Parrot bornavirus 1 to 8 (PaBV-1 to 8) causes neurological and/or gastrointestinal syndromes and death on psittacines. We aimed to identify and to produce epidemiologic knowledge about the etiologic agent associated with a death of two female Psittacus erithacus (grey parrot). Methods and Results: Both parrots were submitted for a complete standardised necropsy. Tissue samples were analysed by PCR. The findings in necropsy were compatible with bornavirus infection. Analysis revealed PaBV-4 related with genotypes detected in captive and in wild birds. The N and X proteins of PaBV-4 were more related to avian bornaviruses, while phosphoprotein was more related to variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1). Within the P gene/phosphoprotein a highly conserved region between and within bornavirus species was found. Conclusions: Portugal is on the routes of the intensive world trade of psittacines. Broad screening studies are required to help understanding the role of wild birds in the emergence and spread of pathogenic bornaviruses. PaBV-4 phosphoprotein is closer to VSBV-1 associated with lethal encephalitis in humans than with some of the avian bornaviruses. The highly conserved P gene/ phosphoprotein region is a good target for molecular diagnostics screenings. ARTICLE HISTORY
611f30fdfb213deb3b27547096a3e01b0ac7e518	Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) colonize the intestinal tract, however, due to not fully understood mutations, they can spread systemically and cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Recent studies on human medicine report that gut microbiota is involved in the development of systemic disorders and could influence the immune response to viral diseases. The aim of this study was to provide preliminary data on the fecal microbiota composition in healthy cats compared to FCoV-infected cats, with and without FIP. Cats were equally grouped as healthy FCoV-negative, healthy FCoV-positive or FIP affected (total n = 15). Fecal sample were evaluated for the microbiota composition. A total of 3,231,916 sequences were analyzed. The samples' alpha-diversity curves did not reach a proper plateau and, for the beta-diversity, the samples seemed not to group perfectly by category, even if the healthy FCoV-positive group showed a hybrid microbial composition between FCoV-negative and FIP groups. Although there were no taxa significantly linked to the different conditions, some peculiar patterns were recognized: Firmicutes was always the most represented phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. In FCoV-positive cats, the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were respectively over-and under-represented, compared to the other groups. Among FIP cats, three subjects shared a similar microbiome, one cat showed a different microbial profile and the other one had the lowest number of diverse phyla. Despite the limited number of animals, some differences in the fecal microbiome between the groups were observed, suggesting to further investigate the possible correlation between gut microbiota and FCoV infection in cats.

5b3fbfb0ff96a28c25c4d8926a1c034b2e48e02a	Following the spread of the infection from the new SARS-CoV2 coronavirus in March 2020, several surgical societies have released their recommendations to manage the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for the daily clinical practice. The recommendations on emergency surgery have fueled a debate among surgeons on an international level. We maintain that laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis, even in the COVID-19 era. Moreover, since laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not more likely to spread the COVID-19 infection than open cholecystectomy, it must be organized in such a way as to be carried out safely even in the present situation, to guarantee the patient with the best outcomes that minimally invasive surgery has shown to have.
669de8eb6d875a069cd9265f4378d9d7a51421e6	The aim of this study was to investigate Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens in 82 diarrheic dogs positive for canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV). Enterotoxigenic C. perfringens type A was isolated from three (3.6%) dogs. One (1.2%) strain was also positive for NetE-and NetF-encoding genes, which are commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs. Toxigenic C. difficile was isolated from one animal (1.2%), which was also positive for A/B toxins. The present study identified C. difficile and C. perfringens infection in CPV-positive dogs. Further studies are necessary to clarify if clostridial infections may predispose or potentiate CPV-infection in dogs or vice versa.
ae05274f4d697a91934241401db6606783cc75f8	We trained and validated late fusion deep learning-machine learning models to predict nonsevere COVID-19, severe COVID-19, non-COVID viral infection, and healthy classes from clinical, lab testing, and CT scan features extracted from convolutional neural network and achieved predictive accuracy of >96% to differentiate all four classes at once based on a large dataset of 689 participants. Abstract Effectively identifying COVID-19 patients using non-PCR clinical data is critical for the optimal clinical outcomes. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of various biomedical features and appropriate technical approaches to accurately detecting COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe (NS) and 148 in severe (S) clinical type, 198 non-infected healthy (H) participants and 129 non-COVID viral pneumonia (V) patients. The participants' clinical information (23 features), lab testing results (10 features), and thoracic CT scans upon admission were acquired as three input feature modalities. To enable late fusion of multimodality data, we developed a deep learning model to extract a 10-feature high-level representation of the CT scans. Exploratory analyses showed substantial differences of all features among the four classes. Three machine learning models (k-nearest neighbor kNN, random forest RF, and support vector machine SVM) were developed based on the 43 features combined from all three modalities to differentiate four classes (NS, S, V, and H) at once. All three models had high accuracy to differentiate the overall four classes (95.4%-97.7%) and each individual class (90.6%-99.9%). Multimodal features provided substantial performance gain from using any single feature modality. Compared to existing binary classification benchmarks often focusing on single feature modality, this study provided a novel and effective breakthrough for clinical applications. Findings and the analytical workflow can be used as clinical decision support for current COVID-19 and other clinical applications with high-dimensional multimodal biomedical features.
2ddf30e6851d38405b527b525c9db9681ce4ccac	Las infecciones de la esfera otorrinolaringológica son la causa más común de prescripción de antibióticos y uno de los motivos más frecuentes de consulta en Atención Primaria. Entre ellas destacan la otitis media aguda y externa difusa, las faringitis agudas y las rinosinusitis agudas. Son de evolución autolimitada y generalmente de etiología vírica, por ello sus complicaciones son poco frecuentes. En la actualidad, el uso indiscriminado de antibióticos predispone a la aparición de resistencias bacterianas en la población. Debido a esto, la decisión de prescripción de antibióticos, hoy día, debe ser más prudente, para ello existen numerosas estrategias diagnósticas que se exponen a continuación. En la presente actualización, destacamos los factores etiológicos y fisiopatológicos de cada infección, así como la estrategia diagnóstica y terapéutica a aplicar en Atención Primaria. Las complicaciones de cada patología y las indicaciones de derivación para ser valoradas por especialistas del área ORL. Abstract Infections are the most common cause of antibiotic prescription and one of the most frequent reasons for consultation in Primary Care. Among them, stand out acute media otitis and diffuse external otitis, acute pharyngitis and acute rhinosinusitis. Commonly they are viral and self-limited, so their complications are rare. Currently, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics have leaded to bacterial resistances; therefore antibiotic prescription should be more careful. Nowadays, several diagnostic strategies are available. In current updated etiological and pathophysiological factors of each infection, diagnostic and therapeutic strategy to be applied in Primary Care as well as the complications of each pathology and the referral indications to be assessed by specialists in the ENT area, will be reviewed. La patogénesis es multifactorial, desempeñando un papel primordial la ventilación de la trompa de Eustaquio, la madurez del sistema inmune del niño y los factores ambientales. *Correspondencia Correo electrónico: teresa.rivera@salud.madrid.org 5340 Medicine. 2019;12(91):5339-51 PATOLOGÍA OFTALMOLÓGICA Y OTORRINOLARINGOLÓGICA Los patógenos más frecuentes de la OMA son Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae y Moraxella catarrhalis, siendo los patógenos similares en los adultos y los niños. En total, S. pneumoniae y H. influenzae juntos son responsables del 50-60% de los casos pediátricos de OMA, mientras M. catarrhalis del 3-14% 3 . Otros patógenos menos implicados son: Streptococcus pyogenes grupo A (en OMA grave), Staphylococcus aureus (más frecuente en adultos), E. coli y Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4,5 . La infección vírica de vías respiratorias es un factor favorecedor de la OMA, aunque se considera la OMA como un proceso fundamentalmente bacteriano. Los factores de riesgo son los siguientes: 1. Disfunción de la trompa de Eustaquio. Es el factor más importante en el desarrollo de la OMA tanto en el niño como en el adulto. Los cambios anatómicos de la adolescencia, como el descenso del paladar blando, mejoran la función de la trompa y contribuyen a la disminución de la incidencia de la OMA en la vida adulta. 2. Obstrucción de la trompa de Eustaquio. 3. Enfermedades inmunológicas. 4. Factores de riesgo epidemiológicos: antecedentes familiares (hermano con historia de OMA), sexo (más frecuente en varones), alimentación con lactancia artificial, asistencia a guardería, fumadores en el medio familiar, clima frío.
a99df2b013ba692ac5836e1d1063c87b3f0b6eeb	The role of factors related to early wheezing and their associations with subsequent development of asthma are controversial. We reevaluated 81 children who had been prospectively followed up since hospitalization for wheezing at less than 2 years of age. The baseline data on characteristics of the children, family-related factors, and viral causes of wheezing were collected on entry into the study. At the median age of 12.3 years, current symptoms suggestive of asthma and allergy were recorded. As part of the clinical examination, an outdoor exercise challenge test and skin prick tests to common inhalant allergens were performed. Asthma, as indicated by current inhaled anti-inflammatory medication or repeated wheezing and positive result in the challenge test, was present in 32 (40%) children, and 90% of them were sensitized to at least one allergen. Early asthma-predictive factors were atopic dermatitis (odds ratio (OR), 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-10.1) and the presence of specific IgE to inhalant allergens (OR, 11.3; 95% CI, 1.9-67.6). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) identification during wheezing in infancy was relatively rare (20%) among later asthmatics compared with other or no viral identification (52%) or rhinovirus identification (58%). Since the prevalence of childhood asthma in our area is 4.0-5.0%, we conclude that the increased risk of asthma persists until the teenage years after hospitalization for wheezing in infancy. The risk was about 5-fold after respiratory syncytial virus-induced wheezing, and more than 10-fold after rhinovirus-induced wheezing in the present study.

01e3b313e78a352593be2ff64927192af66619b5	Viruses interact with hundreds to thousands of proteins in mammals, yet adaptation 6 against viruses has only been studied in a few proteins specialized in antiviral defense. Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or 8 affects a broad array of proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 9 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved 10 across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained 11 proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, 12 virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in 13 humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across 14 all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. Our results 15 demonstrate that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change 16 across mammalian and human proteomes. 17
20488171771062895127afbb276541247cf2b0e0	In order to adapt random forests to the dynamic nature of data streams, the state-of-the-art technique discards trained trees and grows new trees when concept drifts are detected. This is particularly wasteful when recurrent patterns exist. In this work, we introduce a novel framework called PEARL, which uses both an exact technique and a probabilistic graphical model with Lossy Counting, to replace drifted trees with relevant trees built from the past. The exact technique utilizes pattern matching to find the set of drifted trees, that co-occurred in predictions in the past. Meanwhile, a probabilistic graphical model is being built to capture the tree replacements among recurrent concept drifts. Once the graphical model becomes stable, it replaces the exact technique and finds relevant trees in a probabilistic fashion. Further, Lossy Counting is applied to the graphical model which brings an added theoretical guarantee for both error rate and space complexity. We empirically show our technique outperforms baselines in terms of cumulative accuracy on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

The aim of this work is to provide a detailed description of the human respiratory mechanics in healthy and diseased conditions. The model used for this purpose employs some known constitutive functions of the main components of the respiratory system. We give a detailed mathematical description of these functions and subsequently derive additional key ones. We are interested not only in the main output such as airflow at the mouth or alveolar pressure and volume, but also in other quantities such as resistance and pressure drop across each element of the system and even recoil and compliance of the chest wall. Pathological conditions are simulated by altering the parameters of the constitutive functions. Results show that increased upper airway resistance induces airflow reduction with concomitant narrowing of volume and pressure ranges without affecting lung compliance. Instead, increased elastic recoil leads to low volumes and decreased lung compliance. The model could be used in the study of the interaction between respiratory and cardiovascular systems in pathophysiological conditions.

df44bd591c6975c433622e9bfcf4e951c9b0b785	Objectives: As schools plan for re-opening, understanding the potential role children play in the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the factors that drive severe illness in children is critical. Study design: Children ages 0-22 years with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presenting to urgent care clinics or being hospitalized for confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) were offered enrollment in the MGH Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository. Enrolled children provided nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and/or blood specimens. SARS-CoV-2 viral load, ACE2 RNA levels, and serology for SARS-CoV-2 were quantified. Results: A total of 192 children (mean age 10.2 +/-7 years) were enrolled. Forty-nine children (26%) were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; an additional 18 children (9%) met criteria for MIS-C. Only 25 (51%) of children with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with fever; symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, if present, were non-specific. Nasopharyngeal viral load was highest in children in the first 2 days of symptoms, significantly higher than hospitalized adults with severe disease (P = .002). Age did not impact viral load, but younger children had lower ACE2 expression (P=0.004). IgM and IgG to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were increased in severe MIS-C (P<0.001), with dysregulated humoral responses observed. Conclusion: This study reveals that children may be a potential source of contagion in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in spite of milder disease or lack of symptoms, and immune dysregulation is implicated in severe post-infectious MIS-C.

f7778201dec1d1cf942577562819fa9841b1db50	The escalating number of emergency department (ED) visits, length of stay, and hospital overcrowding have been associated with an increasing number of critically ill patients cared for in the ED. Existing physiologic scoring systems have traditionally been used for outcome prediction, clinical research, quality of care analysis, and benchmarking in the intensive care unit (ICU) environment. However, there is limited experience with scoring systems in the ED, while early and aggressive intervention in critically ill patients in the ED is becoming increasingly important. Development and implementation of physiologic scoring systems specific to this setting is potentially useful in the early recognition and prognostication of illness severity. A few existing ICU physiologic scoring systems have been applied in the ED, with some success. Other ED specific scoring systems have been developed for various applications: recognition of patients at risk for infection; prediction of mortality after critical care transport; prediction of in-hospital mortality after admission; assessment of prehospital therapeutic efficacy; screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome; and prediction of pediatric hospital admission. Further efforts at developing unique physiologic assessment methodologies for use in the ED will improve quality of patient care, aid in resource allocation, improve prognostic accuracy, and objectively measure the impact of early intervention in the ED.

b216f710cf7a8d27ebb94fccf7da7650456d3eab	We introduce a compact pangenome representation based on an optimal segmentation concept that aims to reconstruct founder sequences from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Such founder sequences have the feature that each row of the MSA is a recombination of the founders. Several linear time dynamic programming algorithms have been previously devised to optimize segmentations that induce founder blocks that then can be concatenated into a set of founder sequences. All possible concatenation orders can be expressed as a founder block graph. We observe a key property of such graphs: if the node labels (founder segments) do not repeat in the paths of the graph, such graphs can be indexed for efficient string matching. We call such graphs segment repeat-free founder block graphs. We give a linear time algorithm to construct a segment repeat-free founder block graph given an MSA. The algorithm combines techniques from the founder segmentation algorithms (Cazaux et al. SPIRE 2019) and fully-functional bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler index (Belazzougui and Cunial, CPM 2019). We derive a succinct index structure to support queries of arbitrary length in the paths of the graph. Experiments on an MSA of SAR-CoV-2 strains are reported. An MSA of size 410 × 29811 is compacted in one minute into a segment repeat-free founder block graph of 3900 nodes and 4440 edges. The maximum length and total length of node labels is 12 and 34968, respectively. The index on the graph takes only 3% of the size of the MSA.

8ee3cbd80d164095b47332449f87b151a8bb33c2	Objectives: The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a novel infection caused by the coronavirus, which rapidly became a global pandemic. As disease outbreaks can adversely affect mental health, in this study, we explored the perceived stress levels among students during the COVID-19 outbreak that led to the adjournment of faceto-face teaching in KSA. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 367 students from KSA, which assessed their sociodemographic characteristics, Perceived Stress Scale, emotions Q5 , and concerns during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Most Q6 participants were female (74.7%) and secondary school (79.8%) students. More than half of the participants showed moderate levels of stress (55%), while 30.2% registered high levels . Females and university students showed a significant association with stress level (p-value ¼ 0.003 and 0.049, respectively). Conclusions: There was a moderate to high level of stress among students in KSA at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study found a significant correlation between a high level of stress and female university students. The integration of online counselling Q8 and stress management programs would help mitigate the stress of students during distance learning.
7559fa188d87ce8b0eea469a8d65eda6fb8c4c8c	Purpose Many patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer do not adhere to endocrine therapy (ET), and treatment-related side effects are often discussed by participants in online breast cancer forums. Our aim was to survey this unique group of patients about their ET-related experiences. Methods We partnered with patients active in breast cancer social media communities to develop a survey assessing ET-related side effects and medical team communication. Patients with a history of HR+ breast cancer who had received a recommendation to take ET were eligible to participate in the anonymous, online survey. Results Respondents included 2353 women and 54 men. Aromatase inhibitors were the most commonly used medication. Side effects were reported by 91.2%, were more often experienced by women than men (p < 0.001), and were primarily related to medication type. Approximately one-third of respondents discontinued therapy early. While most felt supported by their medical team, 31.5% reported that their side effects were dismissed or minimized. Survey respondents most frequently reported that a healthy diet and exercise, yoga/acupuncture, and vitamins/supplements were helpful in managing ET-related side effects. Conclusions ET-related side effects are very common, and one-third discontinued treatment early. Lifestyle changes and complementary therapies can be important tools for side effect management. One-third of patients did not feel that their side effects were taken seriously. Implications for Cancer Survivors This is the largest survey of ET use by participants in online breast cancer communities. Further research is needed to identify strategies to improve treatment adherence and to better manage ET-related side effects.

Some people may produce food they don't consume people consume the food they produce. As well as providing nutrition and supporting livelihoods, a range of negative health impacts result from this. Among the most important health impacts of livestock are those resulting from infectious diseases: especially, zoonoses, emerging infectious diseases, foodborne disease and antimicrobial resistance. These categories overlap. There are complex linkages between agriculture and agriculture associated disease. Zoonoses are diseases transmissible between animals and people and may be endemic (continually present) or epidemic (occur in outbreaks). Many zoonoses have mainly been controlled in high income countries but are serious health issues in low and middle income countries. Many zoonoses are considered neglected diseases. Diseases emerging from agriculture typically get high levels of attention. Many originate in wildlife and then spillover to people, often using livestock as bridges. There is consensus that emerging zoonotic pathogens are best managed by One Health approaches in which human health, animal health and the environmental sectors work together. Recent epidemics and pandemics of emerging disease highlight the importance of good surveillance and rapid response. The public health importance of foodborne disease is just starting to be recognised. The first global assessment of FBD, developed by the World Health Organisation, suggested the health burden of FBD was comparable to that of malaria, HIV-AIDS or tuberculosis. There are several strategies for managing foodborne disease including good practices, technologies and training. Human infections that do not respond to treatment impose a large burden of illness and death as well as entailing enormous health care costs. An unknown but potentially substantial amount of this burden is due to the use of antimicrobials in agriculture. Multiple initiatives are underway to promote prudent use. It is widely appreciated that agriculture development contributes significantly to public health outcomes. Collaborations that bridge the structural divisions between the agriculture and health sectors provides an opportunity for better managing these important diseases.
025ed2caa0ae1ab7f04d3479116e6ed2a334938d	Background: Cholesterol deficiency (CD), a newly identified autosomal recessive genetic defect in Holstein cattle, is associated with clinical signs of diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypocholesterolemia. Hypothesis/Objectives: The objective is to describe the clinicopathological phenotype of affected Holstein cattle homozygous for the causative apolipoprotein B gene (APOB) mutation. Animals: Six Holstein cattle, 5 calves with a clinical history of chronic diarrhea, and 1 heifer with erosions in the buccal cavity and neurologic symptoms were admitted to the Clinic for Ruminants. Methods: This case review included a full clinical examination, a complete blood count, blood chemistry, and measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides. The animals were euthanized and necropsied. A PCR-based direct gene test was applied to determine the APOB genotype. Results: All 6 animals were inbred, could be traced back to the sire Maughlin Storm, and were confirmed homozygous for the APOB mutation. The clinical phenotype included poor development, underweight, and intermittent diarrhea in the calves, and neurologic signs in the heifer included hypermetria and pacing. Hypocholesterolemia and low triglycerides concentrations were present in all animals. The pathological phenotype of all animals was steatorrhea with enterocytes of the small intestine containing intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles. The peripheral nervous system of the heifer displayed degenerative changes. Conclusions and clinical importance: Suspicion of CD in Holstein cattle is based on the presence of chronic diarrhea with no evidence of primary infections. Confirmation of the associated APOB gene mutation is needed. Additionally, the heifer demonstrated primarily signs of neurologic disease providing an unexpected phenotype of CD.
7274032555eb0d73921b324afa56ee4e9f8f459c	Bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, rabies and other lyssaviruses. Recently, a large number of viruses closely related to members of the genus Coronavirus have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and detected in bat species. In this study, samples were collected from 106 live bats of seven different bat species from 27 different locations in Slovenia. Coronaviruses were detected by RT-PCR in 14 out of 36 horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) fecal samples, with 38.8% virus prevalence. Sequence analysis of a 405-nucleotide region of the highly conserved RNA polymerase gene (pol) showed that all coronaviruses detected in this study are genetically closely related, with 99.5-100% nucleotide identity, and belong to group 2 of the coronaviruses. The most closely related virus sequence in GenBank was SARS bat isolate Rp3/2004 (DQ071615) within the SARS-like CoV cluster, sharing 85% nucleotide identity and 95.6% amino acid identity. The potential risk of a new group of bat coronaviruses as a reservoir for human infections is highly suspected, and further molecular epidemiologic studies of these bat coronaviruses are needed.
541e4b9cc19cdef991c78ff39e6ad79c1f5ecb09	The infectious pathway of the non-enveloped Human Papillomavirus Type 16 (HPV16) includes binding to the cell surface, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and penetration into an endosome. HPV16 infection was shown to decrease in the presence of the lysosomotrophic neutralizing agent ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl). NH 4 Cl neutralizes acidic endo-lysosome compartments, thus suggesting that pH was responsible for PV capsid conformational changes leading endosome escape. Results: However, our data suggested that NH 4 Cl blocked infection by preventing the movement of PV viral particles from the early endosome to the caveosome as was shown for JC virus [1,2]. We have confirmed that HPV 16 infection requires the trafficking of reporter-virions to the caveosome as is the case for BPV1 [3, 4] . In this manuscript we propose that the observed decrease in infection of PV in the presence of NH 4 Cl was due to a loss of movement of reporter-virions to caveosomes. We also demonstrate that cysteine proteases are involved in the infectious process, and that cathepsin B treatment of viral particles was shown to overcome the block of infection observed in the presence of furin inhibition. We confirmed the need for cathepsin B in HPV16 infection using cathepsin B null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We present data that suggest HPV16 infection is in part mediated by cysteine proteases, and that NH 4 Cl blocks the intracellular trafficking of infectious viral particles. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that cysteine proteases influence the infection of a nonenveloped virus.
ec498a8a5905f015c61a2f09c0cdfd7efe24ac8e	Background: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) related to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an emergent syndrome affecting children globally in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The clinical presentation has similarities to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. As knowledge of the cardiac and gastrointestinal manifestations has been emerging, little is known about the impact on the brain. Method: This case describes a 14-yearold boy who developed prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms including delirium followed by impairments in executive functioning in the context of MIS-C with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These symptoms improved in correlation with improvements in inflammatory markers. Results: Neuropsychiatric manifestations including confusion, irritability, and headaches have been reported in pediatric patients with MIS-C. Potential mechanisms include direct neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2, secondary effects of systemic inflammation, and/or adverse side effects of treatment. Conclusions: MIS-C is a novel and poorly understood syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 with effects on multiple organ systems including the central nervous system. As additional cases are reported and research expands, so too will our understanding of the neuropsychiatric manifestations. Better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology would aid in determining targeted interventions.
377d8d4560cb8cca5ca75e49f9f5be8047c767ea	The university environment poses a high risk of spreading infectious diseases, particularly the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1, as it is a mass gathering place for youth. This study aimed to evaluate the predictors of stress symptoms among Chinese university students during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Material/Methods: We used a self-reported questionnaire, the PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) to evaluate the stress symptoms among Chinese university students from Heilongjiang (n=455), Beijing (n=106), Shanghai (n=419) and Sichuan (n=102). We then analyzed the predictors of stress symptoms.
136d068ac5d3e5abaedf3a4690b8713a5df3fc88	Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization. However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years). All patients had comorbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. Conclusions: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.
8e0a624018b11784d1935de7589a21a5196850e9	While the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood, little is known about the postfusion events that precede RNA replication, such as nucleocapsid disassembly. We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replicationdefective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFVΔSK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFVΔSK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways and cellular factors, including clathrin-and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E and RPLP1 expression. The initial round of YFV translation was shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur. Importantly, translation of incoming YFV genomes also required valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large complexes. RNA transfection and washout experiments showed that VCP/p97 functions at a postfusion, pretranslation step in YFV entry. Finally, VCP/p97 activity was required by other flaviviruses in mammalian cells and by YFV in mosquito cells. Together, these data support a critical role for VCP/p97 in the disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a postfusion step in virus entry. IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses are an important group of RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. The mechanisms by which flavivirus nucleocapsids are disassembled during virus entry remain unclear. Here, we used a yellow fever virus entry reporter, which expresses a sensitive reporter enzyme but does not replicate, to show that nucleocapsid disassembly requires the cellular protein-disaggregating enzyme valosin-containing protein, also known as p97.
a4c4e9c1ccf67d2486ec9d37ee5d090f263dcc34	In May 2005, the World Health Organization adopted the new International Health Regulations (IHR), which constitute one of the most radical and far-reaching changes to international law on public health since the beginning of international health cooperation in the mid-nineteenth century. This article comprehensively analyses the new IHR by examining the history of international law on infectious disease control, the IHR revision process, the substantive changes contained in the new IHR and concerns regarding the future of the new IHR. The article demonstrates why the new IHR constitute a seminal event in the relationship between international law and public health and send messages about how human societies should govern their vulnerabilities to serious, acute disease events in the twenty-first century.
3c65766d448f1d73ad5a23b7f7abe951a8c89072	To prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government implemented a strict lockdown in Wuhan starting on 23 January, 2020, which inevitably led to the changes in indications for the mode of delivery. In this retrospective study, we present the changes in the indications for cesarean delivery (CD) and the birth weights of newborns after the lockdown in Wuhan. A total of 3,432 pregnant women in the third trimester of their pregnancies who gave birth in our hospital from 23 as the control group; control group was matched using propensity score matching (PSM). A comparative analysis of the two groups was performed with the chisquare test, t test and rank sum test. The difference in the overall rate of CD between the two groups was not statistically significant (p<0.05). Among the indications for CD, CD on maternal request (CDMR) and fetal distress were also significantly more common in the observation group (p<0.05) than the control group. Furthermore, we found that the weight of newborns was significantly heavier in the observation group than in the control group when considering full-term or close-to-fullterm births (p<0.05). The results may provide useful information to management practices regarding pregnancy and childbirth after lockdown in other cities or countries, enabling better control of the rate of PLOS ONE CD due to CDMR, reducing fetal distress, and controlling newborn weight. We recommend that pregnant women pay more attention to controlling the weight of newborns through diet and exercise.
6534983caa7929d993d00f4b932394737fa41d5b	Understanding the mechanism that leads to immune dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV2 virus is 2 crucial to develop treatment for severe Here, using single cell RNA-seq, we characterized 3 the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from uninfected controls and 4 and cells in paired broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We found a close association of decreased 5 dendritic cells (DC) and increased monocytes resembling myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) 6 which correlated with lymphopenia and inflammation in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients. 7 Those MDSC-like monocytes were immune-paralyzed. In contrast, monocyte-macrophages in BALFs 8 of COVID-19 patients produced massive amounts of cytokines and chemokines, but secreted little 9 interferons. The frequencies of peripheral T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in severe 10 COVID-19 patients, especially for innate-like T and various CD8 + T cell subsets, compared to health 11 controls. In contrast, the proportions of various activated CD4 + T cell subsets, including Th1, Th2 and 12 Th17-like cells were increased and more clonally expanded in severe COVID-19 patients. Patients' 13 peripheral T cells showed no sign of exhaustion or augmented cell death, whereas T cells in BALFs 14 produced higher levels of IFNG, TNF, CCL4 and CCL5 etc. Paired TCR tracking indicated abundant 15 recruitment of peripheral T cells to the patients' lung. Together, this study comprehensively depicts 16 how the immune cell landscape is perturbed in severe COVID-19. 17 : medRxiv preprint 20 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading rapidly 21 worldwide, causing serious public health crisis. Although most SARS-CoV-2 infected cases have 22 asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate diseases, around 10% of those infected may develop severe 23 pneumonia and other associated organ malfunctions 1 . Old age, the male sex and underlying 24 comorbidities are risk factors for causing severe COVID-19 2 , however, the pathogenesis mechanisms 25 remains unclear. Immune perturbations were thought to play crucial roles in the COVID-19 26 pathogenesis. Indeed, many reports showed that lymphopenia and increased blood cytokine levels 27 were closely associated with the development or recovery of severe COVID-19 and proposed to treat 28 the patients by inhibiting cytokine storms 3-6 . 29 Recent studies have revealed more aspects of different immune players in COVID-19 infections. 30 Although SARS-CoV-2 infection in host cells elicits robust secretion of chemokines and cytokines, it 31 only weakly induces the IFNs 7 . In our earlier studies, we showed increased recruitment of highly 32 inflammatory FCN1 + monocyte-derived macrophages in patients' BALFs, suggesting their implication 33 in the cytokine storm 8,9 . Intriguingly, T and B cell responses, and neutralizing antibodies recognizing 34 SARS-CoV-2 were detected among most of the infected patients, with higher levels in those with old 35 age and severe diseases 10-12 . The dysregulations of other immune cell compartments, such as 36 monocytes, DCs, and innate-like T cells are also likely present in severe COVID-19 13-16 .
c549c2bfbb9c30559757547bb42f2999cf286723	Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide. It is transmitted enterically but replicates in the liver. Recent studies indicate that HEV exists in two forms: naked, nonenveloped virions that are shed into feces to mediate inter-host transmission, and membrane-cloaked, quasienveloped virions that circulate in the bloodstream to mediate virus spread within a host. Both virion types are infectious, but differ in the way they infect cells. Elucidating the entry mechanism for both virion types is essential to understand HEV biology and pathogenesis, and is relevant to the development of treatments and preventions for HEV. This review summarizes the current understanding of the cell entry mechanism for these two HEV virion types.
80182e5c15fc88fe7d6aebbbaa6b8f7dbaa7d6de	SARS-CoV2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, uses ACE2 as a cell entry receptor. Soluble ACE2 has been shown to have neutralizing antiviral activity but has a short half-life and no active transport mechanism from the circulation into the alveolar spaces of the lung. To overcome this, we constructed an ACE2-human IgG1 fusion protein with mutations in the catalytic domain of ACE2. This fusion protein contained a LALA mutation that abrogates Fcr binding, but retains FcRN binding to prolong the half-life, as well as achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lung lavage. Interestingly, a mutation in the catalytic domain of ACE2, MDR504, completely abrogated catalytic activity, but significantly increased binding to SARS-CoV2 spike protein in vitro. This feature correlated with more potent viral neutralization in a plaque assay. Parental administration of the protein showed stable serum concentrations with a serum half-life of ~ 145 hours with excellent bioavailability in the epithelial lining fluid of the lung. These data support that the MDR504 hACE2-Fc is an excellent candidate for pre or postexposure prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19.
edabff4c7ec30c3802aceb31904905f404d3126c	Epidemic is a rapid and wide spread of infectious disease threatening many lives and economy damages. It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed. An experiment that is based on the recent coronavirus outbreak originated from Wuhan is conducted by applying this methodology. It is shown that an optimized forecasting model that is constructed from a new algorithm, namely polynomial neural network with corrective feedback (PNN+cf) is able to make a forecast that has relatively the lowest prediction error. The results showcase that the newly proposed methodology and PNN+cf are useful in generating acceptable forecast upon the critical time of disease outbreak when the samples are far from abundant.
2639345a20aef35be49b14c881ca69dd508211e0	The non-coding regions found at the 5 and 3 ends of alphavirus genomes regulate viral gene expression, replication, translation and virus-host interactions, which have significant implications for viral evolution, host range, and pathogenesis. The functions of these non-coding regions are mediated by a combination of linear sequence and structural elements. The capped 5 untranslated region (UTR) contains promoter elements, translational regulatory sequences that modulate dependence on cellular translation factors, and structures that help to avoid innate immune defenses. The polyadenylated 3 UTR contains highly conserved sequence elements for viral replication, binding sites for cellular miRNAs that determine cell tropism, host range, and pathogenesis, and conserved binding regions for a cellular protein that influences viral RNA stability. Nonetheless, there are additional conserved elements in non-coding regions of the virus (e.g., the repeated sequence elements in the 3 UTR) whose function remains obscure. Thus, key questions remain as to the function of these short yet influential untranslated segments of alphavirus RNAs.
79b207dad88813efd15891fd9f4c62c19d3a9f69	BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral infections can increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation, but the mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we determined whether symptomatic respiratory viral infections after lung transplantation induce circulating exosomes that contain lung-associated self-antigens and assessed whether these exosomes activate immune responses to self-antigens. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from lung transplant recipients with symptomatic lower-and upper-tract respiratory viral infections and from non-symptomatic stable recipients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation; purity was determined using sucrose cushion; and presence of lung self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens for rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were determined using immunoblot. Mice were immunized with circulating exosomes from each group and resulting differential immune responses and lung histology were analyzed. RESULTS: Exosomes containing self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens were detected at significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) in serum of recipients with symptomatic respiratory viral infections (n = 35) as compared with stable controls (n = 32). Mice immunized with exosomes from recipients with respiratory viral infections developed immune responses to self-antigens, fibrosis, small airway occlusion, and significant cellular infiltration; mice immunized with exosomes from controls did not (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating exosomes isolated from lung transplant recipients diagnosed with respiratory viral infections contained lung self-antigens, viral antigens, and 20S proteasome and elicited immune responses to lung self-antigens that resulted in development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction in immunized mice.
1ad7e8d2921058296481486bd41ab727b773105e	Objectives. Psychological stress may have an adverse impact on the voice. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between the change in levels of perceived psychological stress and vocal symptoms among Israeli academic college professors required to shift to synchronous online teaching during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. An online questionnaire was completed by 313 professors (156 men and 157 women) from 14 academic colleges in Israel at the end of the first week of online synchronous teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was assumed to be the most burdened and stressful week of the transition. Participants provided self-reports for the current levels of psychological stress and vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching, as well as general psychological stress and general vocal symptoms during previous periods of teaching. Results. The results revealed higher levels of psychological stress but not vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching compared with previous periods of teaching. Psychological stress during the transition to online synchronous teaching was positively associated with vocal symptoms during this period but this association was moderated by general stress. Although there was a positive association between psychological stress and vocal symptoms for individuals who reported low levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching, this association was especially strong for individuals who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. Conclusions. It is important to examine vocal symptoms of professors in specific contexts that are potentially stressful. The psychological stress surrounding the transition to online synchronous teaching was associated with elevated levels of vocal symptoms especially for those who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. These results with professors accord with the notion that psychological stress may have a negative impact on the voice. Tuomainen J, Sellman J, Rönnemaa A-M.

8dc3e3104105b1c360fdfe01de88e4f35d6977d0	The silkworm baculovirus expression system is widely used to produce recombinant proteins. Several strategies for constructing recombinant viruses that contain foreign genes have been reported. Here, we developed a novel defective-rescue BmNPV Bacmid (reBmBac) expression system. A CopyControl origin of replication was introduced into the viral genome to facilitate its genetic manipulation in Escherichia coli and to ensure the preparation of large amounts of high quality reBmBac DNA as well as high quality recombinant baculoviruses. The ORF1629, cathepsin and chitinase genes were partially deleted or rendered defective to improve the efficiency of recombinant baculovirus generation and the expression of foreign genes. The system was validated by the successful expression of luciferase reporter gene and porcine interferon γ. This system can be used to produce batches of recombinant baculoviruses and target proteins rapidly and efficiently in silkworms.

A mechanism of immunization of the population via spread of weakly mutated strain as a natural factor terminating the epidemic is indicated. An epidemic model which details this mechanism is proposed.
bbffc856997da6915317bac594300ed88d2c0026	In this work we present useful techniques and possible enhancements when applying an Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) tool to the linear algebra library Eigen using our in-house AD by overloading (AD-O) tool dco/c++ as a case study. After outlining performance and feasibility issues when calculating derivatives for the official Eigen release, we propose Eigen-AD, which enables different optimization options for an AD-O tool by providing add-on modules for Eigen. The range of features includes a better handling of expression templates for general performance improvements as well as implementations of symbolically derived expressions for calculating derivatives of certain core operations. The software design allows an AD-O tool to provide specializations to automatically include symbolic operations and thereby keep the look and feel of plain AD by overloading. As a showcase, dco/c++ is provided with such a module and its significant performance improvements are validated by benchmarks.
80ba88a1c5134895084c10e3610387e2763c7335	Symbiogenesis is a form of horizontal evolution that occurred 2 billion years ago, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells. It will be argued that, just as we can develop universal selection theories based upon a general account of natural selection, we can also develop a universal symbiogenetic principle that can serve as a general framework to study the origin and evolution of language. (1) Horizontal evolution will be compared with and distinguished from vertical evolution. (2) Different examples of intra-and interspecific horizontal evolution will be given to show that horizontal evolution is quantitatively and qualitatively the most commonly occurring form of evolution throughout the history of life. (3) Finally, three examples are given of how a universal symbiogenesis principle can be implemented in the study of language origins and evolution, more specifically within: (a) the study of language variation, (b) language genes and (c) conceptual blending.
7ee798b6104d800e4c3aee14cec31ada51dd26c7	Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) 1 . To a lesser extent, KSHV is etiologically associated with rare neoplastic disorders like primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) 2 . KS is a malignant vascular tumor characterized by lesions occurring mainly on the skin, but can also affect the mucosa and visceral organs 3 . Hallmarks of KS are angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and inflammation 4 . KSHV is among the list of viral pathogens estimated to cause 12-25% of human cancers worldwide 5 . KSHV has a biphasic life cycle comprised of latent and lytic phases of replication that are distinguished based on divergent gene expression profiles 6 . The dynamics between latent and lytic phases of replication allows the virus to persist for the duration of the host's lifetime 7 . Notably, KSHV establishes latency in the majority of infected cells 8 ; at any given instance, only a subpopulation (<3%) of infected cells display evidence of lytic gene expression 9 . MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the main classes of non-coding RNAs 10 . These are small non-coding RNAs that regulate expression of genes in cells 11 . The human genome encodes thousands of miR-NAs 12 . Of late, miRNAs have emerged as a pivotal component of host cell responses to a pathogen including viruses, bacteria, and fungi 13 . KSHV, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are few examples of the limited number of viruses that encode their own miRNAs 14,15 . KSHV encodes 12 pre-miRNAs which are processed to yield 25 mature miRNAs 16 . The roles of these KSHV-encoded miRNAs is to establish and/or maintain KSHV latency, enhance angiogenesis, spread infected cells, and interfere with the host immune system; all of which are crucial to oncogenesis 17 . Extensive work has been conducted on KSHV encoded miRNAs and the manner by which KSHV replication alters cellular miRNAs 18, 19 . However, there is limited work along the lines of understanding the effects of cellular miRNAs in response to early stages of KSHV infection of cells; specifically internalization of the virus. Recently, we employed deep sequencing for the first time, to analyze the miRNA expression profile in KSHV-infected BJAB cells during early stages of infection 20 . In this study, we attempted to decipher how the cellular miRNA-36 (miR-36) alters KSHV infection in physiologically relevant
dbfed393cd4805e391e8135c3ac31bef87da8847	The main aim of this study is to examine the leading transformations that have occurred throughout the period 2000-2018 in the Spanish publishing industry as a consequence of technological change and its adaptation to the new digital environment. Firstly, this work focuses on the economic importance of Spanish publishing sector studying three key variables: production, employment, and export capacity; secondly, the analysis moves along the structural changes in the Spanish publishing sector through the new millennium, and thirdly, this study discusses on the main business models emerged in the heat of technological disruption. Finally, conclusions close this research.
19fc55dbef34b03dd94cad3565cf48628bfbe842	Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of immunoglobulin M (IgM) during the different stages of sepsis. Methods: In this prospective multicenter study, blood sampling for IgM measurement was done within the first 24 hours from diagnosis in 332 critically ill patients; in 83 patients this was repeated upon progression to more severe stages. Among these 83 patients, 30 patients with severe sepsis progressed into shock and IgM was monitored daily for seven consecutive days. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 55 patients and stimulated for IgM production. Results: Serum IgM was decreased in septic shock compared to patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and patients with severe sepsis. Paired comparisons at distinct time points of the sepsis course showed that IgM was decreased only when patients deteriorated from severe sepsis to septic shock. Serial measurements in these patients, beginning from the early start of vasopressors, showed that the distribution of IgM over time was significantly greater for survivors than for non-survivors. Production of IgM by PBMCs was significantly lower at all stages of sepsis compared with healthy controls. Conclusions: Specific changes of circulating IgM occur when patients with severe sepsis progress into septic shock. The distribution of IgM is lower among non-survivors.
d1e2ca07d5d3c5a380637f69b88d55a2bb18f967	The authors prospectively studied ionizing radiation exposure in consecutive 107 very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates, admitted to their Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Number of X-rays, their indications and calculated dose of radiation were documented. Their mean birth weight (+SD) and gestational age (+SD) were 1077 (±219.8) g and 29.7 (+2.57) wk respectively. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates underwent significantly higher radiographs when compared with VLBW neonates; 7.5(5-13.25) vs. 2(1-6); p < 0.0001. ELBW neonates received 3 times higher dose of radiation, when compared with VLBW neonates; 139.4 μsv (81.6-256.15) vs. 46.6 μsv (14.4-115.7); p < 0.0001. Seven percent of ELBW neonates received >1msv radiation. Lifetime risk associated with high radiation exposure during neonatal period is unknown. Every effort should be taken to reduce number of radiographs. Imaging modalities without radiation exposure such as, point of care ultrasound should be used wherever possible.
3c8fa182d782957ade3296881a99ac4bfe97cd4c	Large amounts of airborne microorganisms are emitted from livestock production. These emitted microorganisms may associate with dust, and are suspected to pose a risk of airborne infection to humans in vicinity and to animals on other farms. However, the extent to which airborne transmission may play a role in the epidemic, and how dust acts as a carrier of microorganisms in the transmission processes is unknown. The authors present the current knowledge of the entire process of airborne transmission of microorganisms-from suspension and transportation until deposition and infection-and their relation to dust. The sampling and the mitigation techniques of airborne microorganisms and dust in livestock production systems are introduced as well. Airborne Microorganisms and Dust in Livestock Houses airborne microorganisms and dust from livestock production systems, as well as the factors affecting their concentrations. In section 3, the physical and biological decay of airborne microorganisms and dust during transmission is described. In section 4, the deposition of airborne microorganisms and dust in respiratory tracts, and the infective dose of pathogenic microorganisms to animals are introduced. In section 5, the strategies and techniques for sampling microorganisms and dust in livestock production systems are proposed. In section 6, the mitigation techniques are described.
bdf801cca01f04b858d3012e609664b4a84ccc12	Different parasitic life strategies are described including four new life cycles: complex rebrooding, micro-male, mesoparasite and prey-predator transfer. Four new life cycle behaviours are named: nursery hiding, mid-moult stage, positive precursor (intraspecific antagonism) and negative precursor (ambush strategy). Further strategies discussed are opossum attack, double parasitism (doubling of the normal reproductive set), duplex arrangement (separated male-female pairs), simple rebrooding, and describing how displaced parasites and superinfections may partly elucidate life cycles. Proportional stunting masks life history effects of parasitism; cuckoo copepods are true parasites and not just associates; burrowing barnacles (acrothoracicans) are not parasites. Further findings based on life cycle information: branchiurans and pentastomes are possibly not related; firefly seed shrimp are not parasites; copepod pre-adult life cycle stages are common in the western pacific but rare in Caribbean; harpacticoids on vertebrates are not parasites; cuckoo copepods are true parasites; explained the importance of pennellid intermediate hosts. Crustacean parasite life cycles are largely unknown (1% of species). Most crustacean life cycles represent minor modifications from the ancestral freeliving mode. Crustacean parasites have less complex and less modified life cycles than other major parasite groups. This limits their exploitation of, and effectiveness, in parasitism. However, these life cycles will be an advantage in Global Change. Most metazoan parasites will be eliminated while crustaceans (and nematodes) will inherit the new world of parasites.
0bafea46c1a1b57ea327df699502a75bf94bc875	Monitoring older adults with wearable sensors and IoT devices requires collecting data from various sources and proliferates the number of data that should be collected in the monitoring center. Due to the large storage space and scalability, Clouds became an attractive place where the data can be stored, processed, and analyzed in order to perform the monitoring on large scale and possibly detect dangerous situations. The use of fuzzy sets in the monitoring and detection processes allows incorporating expert knowledge and medical standards while describing the meaning of various sensor readings. Calculations related to fuzzy processing and data analysis can be performed on the Edge devices which frees the Cloud platform from performing costly operations, especially for many connected IoT devices and monitored people. In this paper, we show a solution that relies on fuzzy rules while classifying health states of monitored adults and we investigate the computational cost of rules evaluation in the Cloud and on the Edge devices.
1aa091c222e1c37ab245b60ed6432ab597480149	Infectious pathogens are known for their rapid evolutionary rates with new mutations arising over days to weeks. The ability to rapidly recover whole genome sequences and analyze the spread and evolution of pathogens using genetic information and pathogen collection dates has lead to interest in real-time tracking of infectious transmission and outbreaks. However, the level of temporal resolution afforded by these analyses may conflict with definitions of what constitutes protected health information (PHI) and privacy requirements for de-identification for publication and public sharing of research data and metadata. In the United States, dates and locations associated with patient care that provide greater resolution than year or the first three digits of the zip code are generally considered patient identifiers. Admission and discharge dates are specifically named as identifiers in Department of Health and Human Services guidance. To understand the degree to which one can impute admission dates from specimen collection dates, we examined sample collection dates and patient admission dates associated with more than 270,000 unique microbiological results from the University of Washington Laboratory Medicine Department between 2010 and 2017. Across all positive microbiological tests, the sample collection date exactly matched the patient admission date in 68.8% of tests. Collection dates and admission dates were identical from emergency department and outpatient testing 86.7% and 96.5% of the time, respectively, with >99% of tests collected within 1 day from the patient admission date. Samples from female patients were significantly more likely to be collected closer to admission date that those from male patients. We show that PHI-associated dates such as admission date can confidently be imputed from deposited collection date. We suggest that publicly depositing microbiological collection dates at greater resolution than the year may not meet routine Safe Harbor-based requirements for patient de-identification. We recommend the use of Expert Determination to determine PHI for a given study and/or direct patient consent if clinical laboratories or phylodynamic practitioners desire to make these data available.
e395779849eac652b43533ff0617dba25d213753	The rat Rattus norvegicus is widely used in experimental work, both providing a rodent model for human ocular disease and as a species for toxicologic screening. In addition, the rat is more and more widely kept as a pet, being both friendly and intelligent. Diagnosis and treatment of ocular disease is important for the welfare of individual animals and whole colonies, but also to ensure that spontaneous disease is not compromising experimental work. Here, ophthalmic conditions are reviewed in order to provide a survey of ocular disease in the rat both for veterinary ophthalmologists and for laboratory animal veterinarians and research workers.
7364613efdf21241a54ae67572eb0a2e39c76683	In this study, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV 2 RNA extract were tested using RT-dPCR using three different primer-probe assays aiming SARS-CoV 2 nucleocapsid coding region. Narrower confidence intervals, indicating high quantification precision were obtained in 100 and 1000-fold serial dilution and RT-dPCR results were equivalent between different assays in the same dilution. High accuracy of this test allowed conclusions regarding the ability of this technique to evaluate precisely the amount of genomic copies present in a sample. We believe that this fast and safe method can assist other researchers in titration of SARS-CoV2 controls used in RT-qPCR without the need of virus isolation.
97ab5bad794553f1af287d9ee88c0113e1ba80ed	We undertook enhanced surveillance of those presenting with respiratory symptoms at five healthcare centers by testing all symptomatic outpatients between November 2013 and January 2014 (winter time). Nasal swabs were collected from 182 patients and screened for MERS-CoV as well as other respiratory viruses using RT-PCR and multiplex microarray. A total of 75 (41.2%) of these patients had positive viral infection. MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples. Human rhinovirus (hRV) was the most detected pathogen (40.9%) followed by non-MERS-CoV human coronaviruses (19.3%), influenza (Flu) viruses (15.9%), and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) (13.6%). Viruses differed markedly depending on age in which hRV, Flu A, and hCoV-OC43 were more prevalent in adults and RSV, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-NL63 were mostly restricted to children under the age of 15. Moreover, coinfection was not uncommon in this study, in which 17.3% of the infected patients had dual infections due to several combinations of viruses. Dual infections decreased with age and completely disappeared in people older than 45 years. Our study confirms that MERS-CoV is not common in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia and shows high diversity and prevalence of other common respiratory viruses. This study also highlights the importance and contribution of enhanced surveillance systems for better infection control.
882567b9731ea3104816803158c4fd2c94152532	The current consensus view is that a higher hierarchical taxonomy of viruses cannot be established for two reasons. Firstly, viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different times. Secondly, subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host/vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material. Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced. Further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes, gene duplication, deletions, frameshift mutations, point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing, unused reading frames.

The assays can detect human H1N1 , H3N2 , and swine-origin (S-OIV) H1N1 Flu A viruses and were effectively used to distinguish Flu A infections (of all subtypes) from Flu B and RSV infections during the current S-OIV outbreak in Milwaukee , WI. The analytical limits of detection were 10 ؊2 to 10 1 TCID 50 /ml depending on the platform and analyte and showed only one minor cross-reaction among 23 common respiratory pathogens (intermittent cross-reaction to adenovirus at >10 7 TCID 50 /ml). A total of 100 clinical samples were tested by tissue culture , both automated assays , and the US Food and Drug Administration-approved ProFlu؉ assay. Both the semiautomated and fully automated assays exhibited greater overall (Flu A , Flu B , and RSV combined) clinical sensitivities (93 and 96% , respectively) and individual Flu A sensitivities (100%) than the Food and Drug Administration-approved test (89% overall sensitivity and 93% Flu A sensitivity). All assays were 99% specific. During the S-OIV outbreak in Milwaukee , WI , the fully automated assay was used to test 1232 samples in 2 weeks. Flu A was detected in 134 clinical samples (126 H1N1 S-OIV , 5 H1N1 [human] , and 1 untyped) with 100% positive agreement compared with other "in-house" validated molecular assays , with only 2 false-positive results. Such accurate testing using automated high-throughput molecule systems should allow clinicians and public health officials to react quickly and effectively during viral outbreaks.

This article reports on the recent consequences of the pandemic for early childhood education in Sweden, Norway, and the United States. The authors illustrate the effects of the pandemic on preschools in their countries, against a backdrop of frequent changes in infection and mortality rates, epidemiological understandings, government strategies, and mitigation strategies regarding preschool closures. Teachers report their experiences and actions in specific early childhood education settings, across the three national contexts. These experiential snapshots identify program priorities, parents' and children's reactions, and the commitment and concerns of teachers. The conversations reveal culturally situated similarities of early childhood educational practices but also differences across contexts. Teachers report on the challenges of their experiences but also benefits for their practice and how they engage with children and their families. Ideas about future preparedness for such pandemics are also discussed. Le nouveau coronavirus, également connu sous le nom de COVID-19, s'est déplacé rapidement à travers le monde en 2020.

aff6401fad7ddccec2a7286d6b593bc474e9f07b	Here, we report the first quantitative experimental study into the molecular basis of the transmission of mechanical signal that originates from biochemical reaction focusing on the length of carbon chain. We designed an experiment by using n-alkanethiols with a same carboxyl group and different chain lengths (n = 1, 5, 10 and 15) to immobilize a same receptor molecule on the gold surface of a microcantilever, and detected the nanomechanical response of biochemical reaction. The sensitivity of the microcantilever was found to be greatly influenced by the chain length of linker that is between the receptor molecule and the microcantilever surface. The efficiency of stress transmission increases significantly with decreasing length of carbon chain. At the same time, we develop a label-free microcantilever sensor for highly sensitive detection of Glycyrrhizic acid (GL). The detection limit of the microcantilever sensor for GL is found to be as low as 20 pg/mL for the shortest linker (n = 1), which is 500 times lower than the longest linker (n = 15) and 50 times lower than that of the corresponding icELISA. These findings will provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of stress transmission, which may be exploited for biochemical sensor and nanoactuation applications.

ce9bb578da4c90de5ff42521070445a83f4a01f0	Since late 2019 the world is facing the rapid spreading of a novel viral disease (SARS-CoV-2) provoked by the coronavirus 2 infection (COVID-19), declared pandemic last 12 March 2020. As of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths worldwide. In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate.
3dd802acc9f1012fabd6433546b8afb5c1524662	Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with chronic inflammation of liver, which leads to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of severe side effects and only a 50-70% cure rate in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients upon current standard treatment with pegylated interferon-a plus ribavirin, new therapeutic regimens are still needed. San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang (SHXT) is a transitional Chinese herbal formula, composed of Rhei rhizoma, Scutellaria radix and Coptidis rhizome, and possesses anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we describe a (+)-catechin-containing fraction extracted from SHXT, referred as SHXT-frC, exhibited effective inhibition of HCV replication, with selectivity index value (SI; CC 50 /EC 50 ) of 84, and displayed synergistic anti-HCV effects when combined with interferon-a, HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir or polymerase inhibitor 2¢-C-methylcytidine. The activation of factor-jB (NF-jB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) signalling pathway has particular relevance to HCV-associated HCC. SHXT-frC treatment also caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the induction of COX-2 and NF-jB expression caused by either HCV replication or HCV NS5A protein. Collectively, SHXT-frC could be an adjuvant treatment for patients with HCV-induced liver diseases.
45336567d3e6da6d00d89bd3c4d6da9eb408ac9c	Background: Coagulopathy is a common abnormality in patients with COVID-19. However, the exact incidence of venous thromboembolic event is unknown in anticoagulated, severe COVID-19 patients. Objectives: Systematic assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) using complete duplex ultrasound (CDU) in anticoagulated COVID-19 patients. We performed a retrospective study in 2 French intensive care units (ICU) where CDU is performed as a standard of care. A CDU from thigh to ankle at selected sites with Doppler waveforms and images was performed early during ICU stay in patients admitted with COVID-19. Anticoagulation dose was left to the discretion of the treating physician based on the individual risk of thrombosis. Patients were classified as treated with prophylactic anticoagulation or therapeutic anticoagulation. Pulmonary embolism was systematically searched in patients with persistent hypoxemia or secondary deterioration. From March 19 to April 11, 2020, 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 were screened for VTE. Eight patients (31%) were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas 18 patients (69%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation. The overall rate of VTE in patients was 69%. The proportion of VTE was significantly higher in patients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation when compared with the other group (100% vs 56%, respectively, P = .03). Surprisingly, we found a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56% of VTE and 6 pulmonary embolisms. Our results suggest considering both systematic screening of VTE and early therapeutic anticoagulation in severe ICU COVID-19 patients.
8b25bae266584f12c3b5af9e5cf3e81c84808c36	Late endosome-resident interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits fusion of diverse viruses, including Influenza A virus (IAV), by a poorly understood mechanism. Despite the broad antiviral activity of IFITM3, viruses like Lassa virus (LASV), are fully resistant to its inhibitory effects. It is currently unclear whether resistance arises from a highly efficient fusion machinery that is capable of overcoming IFITM3 restriction or the ability to enter from cellular sites devoid of this factor. Here, we constructed and validated a functional IFITM3 tagged with EGFP or other fluorescent proteins. This breakthrough allowed live cell imaging of virus co-trafficking and fusion with endosomal compartments in cells expressing fluorescent IFITM3. Three-color single virus and endosome tracking revealed that sensitive (IAV), but not resistant (LASV), viruses become trapped within IFITM3-positive endosomes where they underwent hemifusion but failed to release their content into the cytoplasm. IAV fusion with IFITM3-containing compartments could be rescued by amphotericin B treatment, which has been previously shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of this protein. By comparison, virtually all LASV particles trafficked and fused with endosomes lacking detectable levels of fluorescent IFITM3, implying that this virus escapes restriction by utilizing endocytic pathways that are distinct from the IAV entry pathways. The importance of virus uptake and transport pathways is further reinforced by the observation that LASV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion is inhibited by IFITM3 and other members of the IFITM family expressed in target cells. Together, our results strongly support a model according to which IFITM3 accumulation at the sites of virus fusion is a prerequisite for its antiviral activity and that this protein traps viral fusion at a hemifusion stage PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.by preventing the formation of fusion pores. We conclude that the ability to utilize alternative endocytic pathways for entry confers IFITM3-resistance to otherwise sensitive viruses. Expression of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) in target cells potently inhibits fusion of many unrelated enveloped viruses, including the Influenza A virus, whereas arenaviruses, such as the Lassa fever virus, are resistant to these factors. The mechanism by which IFITMs interfere with the viral fusion step and the mechanism of virus escape from these restriction factors are poorly understood. Here, we tagged the late endosome-resident IFITM3 with fluorescent proteins and visualized single virus entry and fusion with endosomes in living cells expressing these constructs. Single virus and endosome tracking experiments demonstrate that the sensitive Influenza A virus is trapped within acidic IFITM3-positive endosomes that are not permissive for viral fusion. In contrast, the resistant Lassa virus consistently enters and fuses with endosomes lacking IFITM3. Our results imply that accumulation of IFITM3 in virus-carrying endosomes is a prerequisite for blocking fusion of diverse enveloped viruses and that viruses insensitive to this protein escape restriction by entering through distinct endosomal trafficking pathways that do not converge with IFITM3-positive compartments. Virus endosomal trafficking pathways define resistance to IFITM3 PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.org/10.

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a pandemic globally with its syndrome COVID-19. 2. Obesity has recently been shown to be a risk factor for hospitalization for patients with COVID-19. 1. Our findings suggest that younger patients (age < 50 years) hospitalized with COVID-19 have a higher BMI than older patients (age >= 50 years) hospitalized with COVID-19, and this remains true in subgroups of patients without diabetes and hypertension. 2. Our findings demonstrate a negative correlation of BMI and age for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, suggesting degree of obesity matters relative to age (not observed in patients without COVID-19). 1. For those hospitalized with COVID-19, additional attention needs to be paid to BMI, especially with young patients. 2. Weight-related medical conditions may play a role in more severe COVID-19 and require further study. Objective: Obesity has been found to be a risk factor for hospitalization with COVID-19. We were interested in understanding whether patients hospitalized with COVID-19 differed in BMI at older versus younger ages, and if trends were independent of diabetes and hypertension. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-. We compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 above and below the age of 50, and to those hospitalized without COVID-19. We found patients younger than 50 years of age hospitalized with COVID-19 without diabetes or hypertension had mean BMI greater than those older than 50 years of age, with BMI 43.1 (95%CI 34.5 -51.7) kg/m 2 vs 30.1 (95%CI 27.7 -32.5) kg/m 2 (p=0.02). Furthermore, BMI appears to inversely correlate with increasing age amongst patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We did not detect the same difference or trend for patients hospitalized without COVID-19. We found younger patients (age <50 years) with COVID-19 had higher mean BMI than older patients with COVID-19, with and without diabetes and hypertension. This trend did not exist in patients without COVID-19 hospitalized during the same time-period. Accepted Article
732a9865c01df127310a1183fbb97932be1f30e6	Limited access to essential hygiene supplies and facilities, poor nutrition, lack of access to basic medical care, and difficulty complying with mask-wearing and social-distancing recommendations pose significant risks to the homeless community during the coronavirus pandemic. Health systems are experiencing challenges in safely discharging patients who are homeless. The goal of this project was to create a process by which our health system can identify Covid-19 patients who are at risk for inability to self-quarantine due to homelessness, assist in meeting their quarantine needs, and refer them to an appropriate and safe facility when appropriate. The Ability to Self-Quarantine Screener (ASQS) was created and integrated into the EMR and in the first 30 days; this screener and workflows resulted in avoiding 4 discharges to shelters, identifying 17 referrals to social work for specific quarantine needs, and designating 3 placements in a state quarantine facility designed for housing-insecure patients. The success of this project cannot be attributed to a single factor. Each of the following contributed to achieving the objectives on time: » Make expectations clear at the outset regarding time and task commitment for all stakeholders » Anchor the problem scope with an insight from a key informant interview
89e162115392f120533361ea7ed71657dfb6e05e	Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-nB) is a critical regulator of innate and adaptive immune function as well as cell proliferation and survival. The present study demonstrated for the first time that a virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family activates NF-nB in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. In porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-infected cells, NF-nB activation was characterized by translocation of NF-nB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, increased DNA binding activity, and NF-nB-regulated gene expression. NF-nB activation was increased as PRRSV infection progressed and in a viral dose-dependent manner. UV-inactivation of PRRSV significantly reduced the level of NF-nB activation. Degradation of InB protein was detected late in PRRSV infection, and overexpression of the dominant negative form of InBa (InBaDN) significantly suppressed NF-nB activation induced by PRRSV. However, InBaDN did not affect viral replication and viral cytopathic effect. PRRSV infection induced oxidative stress in cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants inhibited NF-nB DNA binding activity in PRRSV-infected cells, suggesting ROS as a mechanism by which NF-nB was activated by PRRSV infection. Moreover, NF-nB-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was observed in PRRSV-infected cells, an observation which implies that NF-nB activation is a biologically significant aspect of PRRSV pathogenesis. The results presented here provide a basis for understanding molecular pathways of pathology and immune evasion associated with disease caused by PRRSV. D
b7afb00c0a51a30372992a1e79f9b5ae48ef48a1	The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly described member of the Paramyxoviridae family belonging to the Metapneumovirus genus. Since its initial description in 2001, hMPV has been reported in most parts of the world and isolated from the respiratory tract of subjects from all age groups. Despite the fact that prospective and case-control studies have been limited, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations associated with hMPV have been found to be reminiscent of those of the human respiratory syncytial virus, with most severe respiratory tract infections occurring in infants, elderly subjects, and immunocompromised hosts. Additional research is needed to define the pathogenesis of this viral infection and the host's specific immune response. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A variety of viruses, including the influenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses, have been associated with clinical syndromes ranging from mild illnesses, such as the common cold, to more severe devastating conditions, such as pneumonia. However, ∼50% of the cases of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and 15%-35% of cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in pediatric patients are still without a known etiology [1-3]. Along with inadequate diagnostic methods, this observation also suggests that other respiratory tract infectious agents may exist and remain to be identified. A new respiratory virus, the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was first isolated in 2001 from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) obtained from young children in The Netherlands [4] . On the basis of morphological, biochemical, and genetic features, hMPV was tentatively classified with avian metapneumovirus (APV), the causative agent of an upper respiratory tract disease in turkeys and other birds [5], in the Metapneumovirus genus. The latter, together with the Pneumovirus genus (containing hRSV as the type species), is Note added in proof. Human metapneumovirus was recently isolated from previously virus-negative nasal wash specimens from 49 (20%) of 248 young children consulting at the Vanderbilt Clinic (Nashville, TN) for lower respiratory tract illnesses [44] . Extrapolation of these results to the entire cohort of patients observed at this institution over a 25-year period (1976-2001) suggests that the prevalence of human metapneumovirus infection was ∼12% in all outpatient children with lower respiratory tract diseases.
b79db4efd34aef38404c9d31e87dc09f2dd9532a	1. Parasites and pathogens of wildlife can threaten biodiversity, infect humans and domestic animals, and cause significant economic losses, providing incentives to manage wildlife diseases. Recent insights from disease ecology have helped transform our understanding of infectious disease dynamics and yielded new strategies to better manage wildlife diseases. Simultaneously, wildlife disease management (WDM) presents opportunities for large-scale empirical tests of disease ecology theory in diverse natural systems. 2. To assess whether the potential complementarity between WDM and disease ecology theory has been realized, we evaluate the extent to which specific concepts in disease ecology theory have been explicitly applied in peer-reviewed WDM literature. 3. While only half of WDM articles published in the past decade incorporated disease ecology theory, theory has been incorporated with increasing frequency over the past 40 years. Contrary to expectations, articles authored by academics were no more likely to apply disease ecology theory, but articles that explain unsuccessful management often do so in terms of theory. 4. Some theoretical concepts such as density-dependent transmission have been commonly applied, whereas emerging concepts such as pathogen evolutionary responses to management, biodiversity-disease relationships and within-host parasite interactions have not yet been fully integrated as management considerations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Theory-based disease management can meet the needs of both academics and managers by testing disease ecology theory and improving disease interventions. Theoretical concepts that have received limited attention to date in wildlife disease management could provide a basis for improving management and advancing disease ecology in the future.
bf2e37de0cae4bde40bcdc42930227843afb1f2d	Despite the increased attention given to the health impact assessment of air pollution and to the strategies to control it in both scientific literature and concrete interventions, the results of the implementations, especially those involving traffic, have not always been satisfactory and there is still disagreement about the most appropriate interventions and the methods to assess their effectiveness. This state-of-the-art article reviews the recent interpretation of the concepts that concern the impact assessment, and compares old and new measurements of attributable risk and attributable fraction. It also summarizes the ongoing discussion about the designs and methods for assessing the air pollution impact with particular attention to improvements due to spatio-temporal analysis and other new approaches, such as studying short term effects in cohorts, and the still discussed methods of predicting the values of attributable risk (AR). Finally, the study presents the more recent analytic perspectives and the methods for directly assessing the effects of not yet implemented interventions on air quality and health, in accordance with the suggestion in the strategic plan 2020−2025 from the Health Effect Institute. Keywords: attributable risk; attributable fraction; health impact assessment; air pollution This state-of-the-art review makes a contribution to current knowledge about the impact assessment of air pollution on population health, by reflecting on the relevance of attributable risk to public health and also on the scientific, methodological problems of defining it, with the aim of contributing to future advances of research in this field.
a9f9f5fc1a2c1decd5f1c135e177ec552dc04a4d	effects of DPP4 inhibitors. Randomized trials assessing DPP4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), their meta-analyses and pharmacovigilance studies reported conflicting results. Since the last meta-analyses assessing the risk of infections with DPP4 inhibitors, powerful cardiovascular outcomes randomized trials (CVOTs) became available. Recent practical recommendations for the management of diabetes during COVID-19 suggested that DPP4 inhibitors could be continued. We updated our previous meta-analysis of CVOTs and focused to the overall risk of respiratory infection associated with DPP4 inhibitors. We searched for published and unpublished CVOTs in Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov, up to January 27, 2020, using key word as "diabetes mellitus", "hypoglycemic agents", "glucose control", "randomized controlled trial", "cardiovascular diseases". We included CVOTs comparing a DPP4 inhibitor versus placebo, in people with T2D, and analysed the risk of respiratory infection with DPP4 inhibitors. We focused on placebocontrolled CVOTs to avoid the pitfalls of small study effect and heterogeneous comparators. We added a sensitivity analysis integrating non-CVOTs and non-placebo CVOTs to challenge our results and to increase the statistical power. Our meta-analysis provides the most powerful and least biased estimation of the association of DPP4 inhibitors and the risk of overall (non COVID-19) respiratory infection. Our analyses integrated 11 349 events of any respiratory infections through 82 644 patients from randomized trials. Our results did not find any association between DPP4 inhibitors use and risk of non-COVID respiratory infections. The current COVID-19 pandemic has raised some questions about pros and cons of certain cardiovascular drugs. Our results support the recent practical recommendations for the management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19, suggesting that DPP4 inhibitors should not be discontinued regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
e762a626fdf32ef0386acee70e5564f31d4ca165	Up to now, various approaches for phylogenetic analysis have been developed. Almost all of them put stress on analyzing nucleic acid sequences or protein primary sequences. In this paper, we propose a new sequence distance for efficient reconstruction of phylogenetic trees based on the distribution of length about common subsequences between two sequences. We describe some applications of this method, which not only show the validity of the method, but also suggest a number of novel phylogenetic insights.
aa5b0a76391aecf1b9875fadebf9f8e2220192b2	Reading is a crucial skill in the 21st century. Thus, scaffolding text comprehension by automatically generated questions may greatly profit learners. Yet, the state-of-the-art methods for automatic question generation, answer-aware neural question generators (NQGs), are rarely seen in the educational domain. Hence, we investigate the quality of questions generated by a novel approach comprising an answer-aware NQG and two novel answer candidate selection strategies based on semantic graph matching. In median, the approach generates clear, answerable and useful factual questions outperforming an answer-unaware NQG on educational datasets as shown by automatic and human evaluation. Furthermore, we analyze the types of questions generated, showing that the question types differ across answer selection strategies yet remain factual.
cebac9562fc77371bff1b6604039bbd98c772f7e	Background: Aminoglycosides have a concentration-dependent therapeutic effect when peak serum concentration (C max ) reaches eight to tenfold the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). With an amikacin MIC of 8 mg/L, the C max should be 64-80 mg/L. This objective is based on clinical breakpoints and not on measured MIC. This study aimed to assess the proportion of patients achieving the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target C max /MIC ≥ 8 using the measured MIC in critically ill patients treated for documented Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) infections. Methods: Retrospective analysis from February 2016 to December 2017 of a prospective database conducted in 2 intensive care units (ICU). All patients with documented severe GNB infections treated with amikacin (single daily dose of 25 mg/kg of total body weight (TBW)) with both MIC and C max measurements at first day of treatment (D1) were included. Results are expressed in n (%) or median [min-max]. Results: 93 patients with 98 GNB-documented infections were included. The median C max was 55.2 mg/L [12.2-165.7] and the median MIC was 2 mg/L [0. . C max /MIC ratio ≥ 8 was achieved in 87 patients (88.8%) while a C max ≥ 64 mg/L was achieved in only 38 patients (38.7%). Overall probability of PK/PD target attainment was 93%. No correlation was found between C max /MIC ratio and clinical outcome at D8 and D28. Conclusion: According to PK/PD parameters observed in our study, single daily dose of amikacin 25 mg/kg of TBW appears to be sufficient in most critically ill patients treated for severe GNB infections.
972701bc4b66493f6bed639cc4f4c3f2b09467fd	In a field trial on a farm in Turkey, we tested whether specific egg-yolk antibodies had a prophylactic effect on neonatal diarrhea. Owing to its antibody spectrum, this egg powder was very suitable for this farm since mainly rotavirus was identified. Regardless of the dosage (2 g, 4 g, or 8 g egg powder), the calves (n = 164) which received specific egg-yolk antibodies via the whole egg during the first 14 days of life showed significant improvements in risk and duration of diarrhea and in body weight gain compared with calves of the control group (n = 80) which had not received any egg powder. These significant differences in body weight still persisted after 3 months of life. The mortality risk in the control group amounted to 8.8%, while in all egg powder groups (n = 164) only one calf died as a result of diarrhea. Breed-dependent differences in the parameters were not observed.
cf01ed843b6e8860b8a87c629852805514d149ae	Point of care test Pili Mycobacterial pili Biomarker s u m m a r y Novel biomarkers are urgently needed for point of care TB diagnostics. In this study, we investigated the potential of the pilin subunit protein encoded by the mtp gene as a diagnostic biomarker. BLAST analysis of the mtp gene on published genome databases, and amplicon sequencing were performed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) strains and other organisms. The protein secondary structure of the amino acid sequences of non-tuberculous Mycobacteria that partially aligned with the mtp sequence was analysed with PredictProtein software. The mtp gene and corresponding amino acid sequence of MTBC were 100% homologous with H37Rv, in contrast to the partial alignment of the non-tuberculous Mycobacteria. The mtp gene was present in all 91 clinical isolates of MTBC. Except for 2 strains with point mutations, the sequence was 100% conserved among the clinical strains. The mtp gene could not be amplified in all non-tuberculous Mycobacteria and respiratory organisms. The predicted MTP protein structure of Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium ulcerans and Mycobacterium abscessus differed significantly from that of the M. tuberculosis, which was similar to Mycobacterium marinum. The absence of the mtp gene in non-tuberculous Mycobacteria and other respiratory bacteria suggests that its encoded product, the pilin subunit protein of M. tuberculosis may be a suitable marker for a point of care TB test.
7ab854e488ea41f8d1187bce92b235ff1d6f0618	Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been detected worldwide in several bat species, which are considered the main reservoir. The attention to the high diversity of CoVs hosted by bats has increased during the last decade due to the high number of human infections caused by two zoonotic Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that cause several respiratory diseases. Among coronaviruses, two Alpha-CoV strains (HuCoV-229E and HuCoV-NL63) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to severe disease in children, elderly and individuals affected by illnesses. Phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat Alpha-CoV strains revealed their evolutive correlation to human strains, suggesting their origin in bats. The genome of CoVs is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and recombination events, increasing their ability to switch hosts and their zoonotic potential. In this study, three strains of Alpha-CoV genera detected in Italian bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) were fully sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and characterized. The complete genome analysis showed the correlation of the Italians strains with a Chinese strain detected in 2013 and, based on CoV molecular species demarcation, two new Alpha-CoV species were established. The analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed the correlation of the Italian strains with CoVs that was only detected in the bat Pipistrellus genera (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus Pipistrellus) in European countries.
be0d6fb3b99b467756a0f5a26e3976a91d49ec2e	The past few months have yielded disconcerting news about viruses carried in mammalian reservoirs. What is the relevance of virus discoveries mushrooming in the literature? Will bats yield the next pandemic virus? Animal ecologists and virologists need to join forces.
5f72fd41d7ba8d4d7de7aa1f83fc5c90ffa50b03	The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the 2019-nCoV, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a timevarying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 -February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential interprovince routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV.

a4d27546d0c58950f8d8e84a0de97d90a1d4cf52	See the Editorial Commentaries by Musher on pages 824-5 and Jain and Pavia on pages 826-8.) Background. The frequent lack of a microbiological diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) impairs pathogendirected antimicrobial therapy. This study assessed the use of comprehensive multibacterial, multiviral molecular testing, including quantification, in adults hospitalized with CAP. Methods. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for 323 adults with radiologically-confirmed CAP admitted to 2 UK tertiary care hospitals. Sputum (96%) or endotracheal aspirate (4%) specimens were cultured as per routine practice and also tested with fast multiplex real-time polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assays for 26 respiratory bacteria and viruses. Bacterial loads were also calculated for 8 bacterial pathogens. Appropriate pathogen-directed therapy was retrospectively assessed using national guidelines adapted for local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Results. Comprehensive molecular testing of single lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens achieved pathogen detection in 87% of CAP patients compared with 39% with culture-based methods. Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the main agents detected, along with a wide variety of typical and atypical pathogens. Viruses were present in 30% of cases; 82% of these were codetections with bacteria. Most (85%) patients had received antimicrobials in the 72 hours before admission. Of these, 78% had a bacterial pathogen detected by PCR but only 32% were culture-positive (P < .0001). Molecular testing had the potential to enable de-escalation in number and/or spectrum of antimicrobials in 77% of patients. Conclusions. Comprehensive molecular testing significantly improves pathogen detection in CAP, particularly in antimicrobialexposed patients, and requires only a single LRT specimen. It also has the potential to enable early de-escalation from broadspectrum empirical antimicrobials to pathogen-directed therapy.
0ecc36ef369e1d2b3f2d1b00e66123c9e089d98d	African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large double-stranded DNA virus responsible for a lethal pig disease, to which no vaccine has ever been obtained. Its genome encodes a number of proteins involved in virus survival and transmission in its hosts, in particular proteins that inhibit signaling pathways in infected macrophages and, thus, interfere with the host's innate immune response. A recently identified novel ASFV viral protein (pI329L) was found to inhibit the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway, TLR3 being a crucial ''danger detector.'' pI329L has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing extracellular putative leucine-rich repeats similar to TLR3, suggesting that pI329L might act as a TLR3 decoy. To explore this idea, we used comparative modeling and other structure prediction protocols to propose (a) a model for the TLR3-Toll-interleukin-1 receptor homodimer and (b) a structural fold for pI329L, detailed at atomistic level for its cytoplasmic domain. As this later domain shares only remote sequence relationships with the available TLR3 templates, a more complex modeling strategy was employed that combines the iterative implementation of (multi)threading/assembly/refinement (I-TASSER) structural prediction with expertise-guided posterior refinement. The final pI329L model presents a plausible fold, good structural quality, is consistent with the available experimental data, and it corroborates our hypothesis of pI329L being a TLR3 antagonist.
17bbe32558609da8c1aceab2b751383aa9c3c18b	Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion is a multistep process that involves a spectrum of interactions that are not well characterized. We have characterized a 113-kDa immunogenic protein, PF3D7_1431400 (PF14_0293), that possesses coiled-coil structures. The protein is localized on the surfaces of both merozoites and gametocytes, hence the name Plasmodium falciparum surface-related antigen (PfSRA). The processed 32-kDa fragment of PfSRA binds normal human erythrocytes with different sensitivities to enzyme treatments. Temporal imaging from initial attachment to internalization of viable merozoites revealed that a fragment of PfSRA, along with PfMSP1 19, is internalized after invasion. Moreover, parasite growth inhibition assays showed that PfSRA P1 antibodies potently inhibited erythrocyte invasion of both sialic acid-dependent and -independent parasite strains. Also, immunoepidemiological studies show that malaria-infected populations have naturally acquired antibodies against PfSRA. Overall, the results demonstrate that PfSRA has the structural and functional characteristics of a very promising target for vaccine development.
bed1c9834dbd81a9e254940379f80c3447a122e9	The study of virus disease emergence, whether it can be predicted and how it might be prevented, has become a major research topic in biomedicine. Here we show that efforts to predict disease emergence commonly conflate fundamentally different evolutionary and epidemiological time scales, and are likely to fail because of the enormous number of unsampled viruses that could conceivably emerge in humans. Although we know much about the patterns and processes of virus evolution on evolutionary time scales as depicted in family-scale phylogenetic trees, these data have little predictive power to reveal the short-term microevolutionary processes that underpin cross-species transmission and emergence. Truly understanding disease emergence therefore requires a new mechanistic and integrated view of the factors that allow or prevent viruses spreading in novel hosts. We present such a view, suggesting that both ecological and genetic aspects of virus emergence can be placed within a simple population genetic framework, which in turn highlights the importance of host population size and density in determining whether emergence will be successful. Despite this framework, we conclude that a more practical solution to preventing and containing the successful emergence of new diseases entails ongoing virological surveillance at the human-animal interface and regions of ecological disturbance. Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future. -Niels Bohr
a61e5889417eb9962a005eadfba3c9d28e73a9af	Conjugation or deconjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) or ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) to or from cellular proteins is a multifaceted and universal means of regulating cellular physiology, controlling the lifetime, localization, and activity of many critical proteins. Deconjugation of Ub or UBL from proteins is performed by a class of proteases called isopeptidases. Herein is described a readily quantifiable novel isopeptidase assay platform consisting of Ub or UBL fused to the reporter enzyme phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ). Isopeptidase activity releases PLA 2 , which cleaves its substrate, generating a signal that is linear with deubiquitylase (DUB) concentration and is able to discriminate DUB, deSUMOylase, deNEDDylase, and deISGylase activities. The power and sensitivity of the UBL-PLA 2 assay are demonstrated by its ability to differentiate the contrasting deISGylase and DUB activities of two coronavirus proteases: severe acute respiratory syndrome papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) and NL63 CoV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). Furthermore, direct comparisons with the current Ub-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) assay demonstrated that the Ub-PLA 2 assay is an effective tool for characterizing modulators of isopeptidase activity. This observation was expanded by profiling the inhibitory activity of the nonselective isopeptidase inhibitor NSC 632839 against DUBs and deSUMOylases. Taken together, these studies illustrate the utility of the reporter-based approach to measuring isopeptidase activity. Supplemental material: see www.proteinscience.org The content of most proteins in the cell is governed by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (Hershko and Ciechanover 1998). Ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) such as SUMO, NEDD8, and ISG15 regulate proteins by additional mechanisms, for example, intracellular compartmentation, signal transduction, and the regulation of some E3 ligases (Welchman et al. 2005) . Degradation of a targeted protein by the ubiquitin system typically involves the concerted action of two to three enzymes (for review, see Hershko and Ciechanover 1998). Typically, polyubiquitylated polypeptides are delivered to the proteasome complex, which hydrolyzes the polypeptide into short oligopeptides and releases free ubiquitin, which is recycled. The process is reversible; ubiquitin, as well as other
6a407d060dcd275b1b12219e3effc80afee81cc4	Real-time RT-PCR assay, based on light upon extension (LUX) fluorogenic primer and LightCycle technology, was developed for rapid detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Viral RNA from different TGEV isolates and clinical specimens was detected. To evaluate the sensitivity of the assay, a gel-based RT-PCR method targeted at the same 101 bp sequence was also developed. Serial 10-fold dilutions of TGEV RNA were detected by the two methods. Although the real time method used only 2 l RNA for each reaction, a 10-fold increase of sensitivity over that of the gel-based method, which used 10 l RNA was demonstrated. The study indicates that the LUX assay reported below is rapid, reliable and sensitive and it has the potential for use as an alternative molecular method for TGEV diagnosis.
eccb1d20058e89005a7cbb6936b2e10f107b221f	Inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) is critical in the development of the neuropathology associated with the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent studies have identified a family of soluble proinflammatory molecules called chemokines that are able to direct leukocyte infiltration into the CNS in response to infection or injury. Identification of chemokines within and around demyelinating lesions in MS patients indicate a potential role for these molecules in contributing to the pathogenesis of MS. To address this issue, we have used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the CNS to understand the dynamic interaction of chemokine expression as it relates to inflammation and neuropathology. Our results indicate that chemokine expression within the CNS results in persistent recruitment of both T lymphocytes and macrophages and results in subsequent myelin destruction. Herein, we demonstrate the complexity of the chemokine response to MHV infection of the CNS and the delicate balance that exists between host defense and development of disease.

However, the use of HTS for the characterization of viral pathogens from clinical samples remains limited. Here, we report the identification of a novel Orthobunyavirus species isolated from horse plasma. The identification was based on a straightforward HTS approach. Following enrichment in cell culture, RNA was extracted from the growth medium and rapid library preparation, HTS and primary bioinformatic analyses were performed in less than 12 hours. Taxonomical profiling of the sequencing reads did not reveal sequence similarities to any known virus. Subsequent application of de novo assembly tools to the sequencing reads produced contigs, of which three showed some similarity to the L, M, and S segments of viruses belonging to the Orthobunyavirus genus. Further refinement of these contigs resulted in high-quality, full-length genomic sequences of the three genomic segments (L, M and S) of a novel Orthobunyavirus. Viruses are a global source of significant health and economic burdens. Interactions between humans and animals are the paramount driving force for the ever-growing distribution and emergence of novel viruses. Other reasons for the spread of new viruses include climate change, globalization, social mobilization and intensive farming 1-3 . A novel virus might emerge in the form of an outbreak, and in this scenario, rapid diagnosis is of extreme importance for the selection of prevention and treatment strategies. However, such a diagnosis is not trivial, especially for RNA viruses, since the viruses in this category have small but highly variable genomes 4 . Viruses can be identified by a wide range of techniques. Traditional methods rely on morphological characteristics observed by light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in various specimens such as cell cultures and fertilized eggs. Serology, as well as antibody-based diagnostics, allow to identify the virus and in some cases even at the species level. However, these methods provide only morphological clues, depend on the availability of an antiserum and, for the most part, are not strain specific 5 . In recent decades, molecular methods such as PCR, RT-PCR and microarrays, which are in most cases more sensitive than traditional techniques, have been used to complement and even replace traditional techniques. However, most of the molecular assays bromide gel electrophoresis. The agarose gel was then visualized under UV light using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc 2000 gel documentation system. A 50-bp DNA ladder (Cat# N3236L, New England Biolabs) was used for RT-PCR product size determination.

fbc87e1030a9acf23a6000af98c37d38b1bba918	The construction of DENV2 Rluc reporter replicon has been described previously (Manzano et al., 2011). To establish a stable BHK-21 cell line expressing the DENV2 Rluc reporter replicon, the Neo r gene is inserted downstream from the Rluc gene and 19aa sequence encoding the FMDV2A autoprotease (Ryan et al., 1991; Vakharia et al., 1987) fused in-frame, followed by encephalomyocarditis virus 5'-leader sequence containing the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the open reading frame encoding the 7 NS proteins similar to arrangement in the DENV2 Rluc reporter replicon (Manzano et al., 2011). The construction of DENV2 Rluc reporter replicon containing the Neo r gene was achieved in several steps. Rluc-FMDV2A-Neo r -IRES in pGEMTEasy vector: This clone was constructed using sequence overlap extension PCR method consisting of 5 PCRs. In the first PCR, using DENV2 RepRluc plasmid as a template (Manzano et al., 2011), the Rluc gene was amplified using 5'Rluc-F and 3'Rluc5'2A-R (Table 1) and Supplemental Fig. 1 . In a second PCR using pIRESNeo3 (Clontech) as a template, the Neo gene was amplified with primers 3'2A5'Neo-F and 3'Neo5'Ires-R yielding Neor gene with sequence extensions of FMDV 2A and IRES at the 5'-and 3'end of Neo r gene, respectively ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). In the third PCR using DENV2 RepRluc plasmid as a template, the IRES element was amplified with 3'Neo5'Ires-F and 3'Ires-R yielding a IRES element containing a Neo r sequence extension at the 5'-end ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). In the fourth PCR, the products from PCR 1 and PCR 2 were combined and amplified with primers 5'Rluc-F and 3'Neo5'Ires-R producing a PCR product composed of Rluc-2A-Neo r -5'-IRES extension. In the 5 th PCR, the PCR product from PCR 4 was mixed with the product from PCR 3 and amplified with primers 5'Rluc-F and 3'Ires-R to produce 100 µl) were plated into each well of a 96-well plate and were incubated for 24 h at 37 o C. AQ at 0, 0.1, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 100 µM was added during cell lysis. Substrate was added and the Rluc activities were measured as described (Fig. S3 ). Assays were performed in triplicate in 96-well half area black plates (Greiner Bio-One). The reaction mixture (100 µl) contained 200 mM Tris pH 9.5, 30% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, 1% DMSO, 50 nM DENV2 NS2BH-(QR)-NS3pro (Lai et al., 2013; Yon et al., 2005), 10 µM of fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate, Bz-Nle-Lys-Arg-Arg-AMC, and 0, 7.81, 15.63, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 µM. AQ (DMSO 1%). The compoundenzyme complex was pre-incubated for 15 min at room temperature before addition of the substrate. The reaction was continued at 37 ο C for 30 min. The release of AMC from the substrate was recorded every 1.5 min at 380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission in a SpectraMax Gemini EM spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). DMSO (1%) alone was used as the no-inhibitor control (100% protease activity) and the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI or aprotinin at 5 µM), which has a Ki of ~62 nM against the DENV2 protease, was used as a positive control (0% protease activity). Data was calculated with Microsoft Excel and plotted using the GraphPad Prism v5 software. RNA 1-200 template was amplified from pSY2 plasmid template (You and Padmanabhan, 1999) using SB-F and SB-R as forward and reverse primers (Table 1). The RNA template was synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Epicentre, Charlotte, NC). Radiolabeled capped RNA was generated in a reaction containing 1 µCi α-[ 32 P]-GTP, 1 µM unlabeled GTP and vaccinia virus-encoded capping enzyme (m7ScriptCap from CellScript, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed by P-30 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the RNA was recovered by RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo research, Irvine, CA). The MTase reaction contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4 units RNase inhibitor, 500 nM DENV2 NS5 FL , 1 µg RNA, and 0, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 µM AQ in water. The compound-enzyme mixture was preincubated for 15 min before addition of the substrate, 400 nM S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The reaction was incubated at 37 o C for 1 h. The RNA was extracted by RNA clean and concentrator (Zymo research), and treated with nuclease P1 (Sigma Aldrich). The reaction products were fractionated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on cellulose PEI plate (Sigma Aldrich) using 0.45 M ammonium sulfate as solvent. The plate was dried, exposed to a phosphorimaging screen (Amersham Bioscience, Sunnyvale, CA), and spots were quantified by ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The positive and negative sense subgenomic RNA templates were constructed and transcribed in vitro as described for DENV2 and WNV (Nomaguchi et al., 2003; Nomaguchi et al., 2004; You and Padmanabhan, 1999). The RdRP assay was performed using DENV2 NS5 FL enzyme as described (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Nomaguchi et al., 2003). Briefly, the mixture of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 µg RNA template, 500 µM of ATP, CTP, and UTP, 10 µM unlabeled GTP and 10 µCi α-[ 32 P]-GTP, 500 nM DENV2 NS5 FL , and AQ (50 µM) at 30 o C for 1 h. The RNA product was extracted by acid phenol/chloroform, and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radioactive signals from the newly synthesized RNAs were quantified by PhosphorImager (Amersham Bioscience). In addition to determining the PFU in the supernatants from the AQ-treated BHK-21 cells as described above, the virus titers were also determined directly in the AQ-treated cell monolayers as follows. BHK-21 cells were seeded into 12-well plates as described in (vi) and incubated until reaching ~90% confluence. AQ at 0, 1, 5, 10, and 25 µM and DENV2 (MOI of 0.01) were added to BHK-21 cells. After incubation for 1 h at 37 o C, cells were washed with 1X PBS, and were overlaid with a medium containing MEM supplemented with 2% FBS, Penn-Strep, and 1% methylcellulose. After incubation for 3-4 days at 37 o C, cells were fixed and stained as previously described. Each set of experiments was done in duplicate and confirmed by two independent experiments.

d2940b9d521b020e01f3ac9beab3d62286266b1a	Objectives. After two outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from March-June 2003, we reviewed the unexpected role and responsibilities of pharmacists during these two crises, and present strategies for better crisis preparedness. Methods and Results. Pharmacists were actively involved in battling the SARS crises. After conducting extensive literature searches and evaluations, pharmacists prepared administration and dosing guidelines for the two investigational drugs, ribavirin and interferon alfacon-1, that were being used to treat the syndrome. They provided direct patient care under modified conditions. They revised drug distribution procedures and developed new ones to meet more stringent infection-control standards. Collaborative teamwork with key stakeholders was important in accomplishing tasks in an efficient and timely manner. Regular communication with health care staff took place internally and externally. Education and updated information for pharmacists was crucial. Conclusion. Pharmacists can play a vital role during crises in the areas of drug distribution, drug information, and direct patient care. Collaborative teamwork and close communication are keys to success. Pharmacists must be proactive and take a leadership role in assuming pharmacy-related responsibilities.

He developed leukocytosis as soon as ARDS required intubation and aggressive mechanical ventilation: hence he underwent 3 early therapeutic leukapheresis treatments in order to avoid the worsening of related cardiopulmonary complications, according to recent literature on pertussis infection in infants. The infant was discharged from PICU healthy.
22aa3907c854fe265261d1950a68177bc90e2a83	We report a naturally occurring human astrovirus (HAstV) strain detected in two different geographic locations. We identified two isolates of this strain in a diarrhea outbreak at a child care center in Houston, Texas; and two isolates in diarrhea stool samples from two children in Mexico City. All four isolates were detected in stool samples by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). One of the Mexican isolates was typed by EIA and all four isolates were HAstV-5 by typing RT-PCR. The four isolates were >97% nucleotide-identical in two different genomic regions: ORF1a (246nt), and the 3 end of the genome (471nt). One isolate from each geographic location was further sequenced in the transition region from ORF1b to ORF2 (1255nt) and this region of the two isolates showed ≥ 99% nt identity. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of eight HAstV antigenic types and the novel strain in the transition region demonstrated the new strain being closely related to HAstV-3 in ORF1b, but closest to HAstV-5 in ORF2. These results and high sequence identity among all HAstV antigenic types in the transition region and RNA structural predictions supported a potential recombination site at the ORF1b/ORF2 junction. This is the first evidence that recombination occurs among human astroviruses.

Here we report the results of a survey in which scientists in Germany were asked about their attendance at conferences, their reasons for attending, and their willingness to explore new approaches that would reduce the impact of conferences on the environment. A majority of respondents were keen to reduce their own carbon footprint and were willing to explore alternatives to the traditional conference.
1e4e1f0244348c74423087362d72302b3c213898	The original idea of profiling implies attacking one device with a leakage model generated from an "identical copy", but this concept cannot be always enforced. The leakage model is commonly generated with traces from an "open device", assuming that a model which works for one device should work for another copy as well. In practice, applying a leakage model to a different copy of the same device (commonly called portability) is a hard problem to deal with, as intrinsic differences in the devices or the experimental setups used to obtain the traces cause behavioural variations which lead to an unsuccessful attack. In this paper we propose a novel similarity assessment technique that allows evaluators to quantify the differences among various copies of the same device. Moreover, we support this technique with actual experiments to show that this metric is directly related to the portability issue. Finally, we derive a method that improves the performance of template attacks.

Much has been written and disseminated regarding protocols for death investigation, infection mitigation and risks, and management of dead. However, in many contexts, the ability of forensic practitioners to follow best-practice procedures is limited by the resources available to them. This article examines some of the impact of the novel coronavirus in Brazil, with emphasis on management of the dead and challenges faced by medicolegal services.

3f06c41154ff140670ba10f54eeaf640c39f29b9	The mitochondrial protein repertoire varies depending on the cellular state. Protein component modifications caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion are related to a wide range of human diseases; however, little is known about how nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (mt proteome) changes under such dysfunctional states. In this study, we investigated the systemic alterations of mtDNA-depleted (r 0 ) mitochondria by using network analysis of gene expression data. By modularizing the quantified proteomics data into protein functional networks, systemic properties of mitochondrial dysfunction were analyzed. We discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules are involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while up-regulated proteins are responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that r 0 cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. Our results demonstrate that mt protein composition changed to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. Human mt protein functional networks provide a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions. Citation: Jeon J, Jeong JH,
1e88d68fd702c8accc72cece9a8df345c64b0b8c	Blockade of the CEACAM1 signaling pathway has recently been implicated as a novel mechanism for cancer immunotherapy. CC1, a mouse anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), has been widely used as a pharmacological tool in preclinical studies to inform on CEACAM1 pathway biology although limited data are available on its CEACAM1 blocking characteristics or pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic profiles. We sought to investigate CEACAM1 expression on mouse tumor and immune cells, characterize CC1 mAb binding, and evaluate CC1 in syngeneic mouse oncology models as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 mAb. CEACAM1 expression was observed at high levels on neutrophils, NK cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), while the expression on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was low. Unexpectedly, rather than blocking, CC1 facilitated binding of soluble CEACAM1 to CEACAM1 expressing cells. No anti-tumor effects were observed in CT26, MBT2 or A20 models when tested up to 30 mg/kg dose, a dose that was estimated to achieve >90% target engagement in vivo. Taken together, tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells express low levels of CEACAM1 and CC1 Ab mediates no or minimal anti-tumor effects in vivo, as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1 treatment.
f2d560b5f6bd9fcad15c0b5e6e4284cfe9386e3c	The clinical application of HIV fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide (T20), was limited mainly because of its short half-life. Here we designed and synthesized two PEGylated C34 peptides, PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34, with the PEG chain length of 2 and 5 kDa, respectively, and evaluated their anti-HIV-1 activity and mechanisms of action. We found that these two PEGylated peptides could bind to the HIV-1 peptide N36 to form high affinity complexes with high α-helicity. The peptides PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 effectively inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion with an effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC 50 ) of about 36 nM. They also inhibited infection of the laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain NL4-3 with EC 50 of about 4-5 nM, and against 47 HIV-1 clinical isolates circulating in China with mean EC 50 of PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 of about 26 nM and 32 nM, respectively. The plasma half-life (t 1/2 ) of PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 was 2.6 h and 5.1 h, respectively, and the t 1/2 of PEGylated C34 was about 2.4-fold and 4.6-fold longer than C34 (~1.1 h), respectively. These findings suggest that PEGylated C34 with broad-spectrum anti-HIV-1 activity and prolonged half-life can be further developed as a peptide fusion inhibitor-based long-acting anti-HIV drug for clinical use to treat HIV-infected patients who have failed to respond to current anti-retrovirus drugs.
441421494c2a4ed45a8d6b711842ed8ee43ec038	Fever screening based on infrared (IR) thermographs (IRTs) is an approach that has been implemented during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. A recently published international standard indicates that regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi provide accurate estimates of core body temperature and are preferred sites for fever screening. Therefore, rapid, automated identification of the canthi regions within facial IR images may greatly facilitate rapid fever screening of asymptomatic travelers. However, it is more difficult to accurately identify the canthi regions from IR images than from visible images that are rich with exploitable features. In this study, we developed and evaluated techniques for multi-modality image registration (MMIR) of simultaneously captured visible and IR facial images for fever screening. We used free form deformation (FFD) models based on edge maps to improve registration accuracy after an affine transformation. Two widely used FFD models in medical image registration based on the Demons and cubic B-spline algorithms were qualitatively compared. The results showed that the Demons algorithm outperformed the cubic B-spline algorithm, likely due to overfitting of outliers by the latter method. The quantitative measure of registration accuracy, obtained through selected control point correspondence, was within 2.8 ± 1.2 mm, which enables accurate and automatic localization of canthi regions in the IR images for temperature measurement.
540ccda8bb32d2b9192782b878cc2759da109212	The phosphoprotein (P) gene of most Paramyxovirinae encodes several proteins in overlapping frames: P and V, which share a common N-terminus (PNT), and C, which overlaps PNT. Overlapping genes are of particular interest because they encode proteins originated de novo, some of which have unknown structural folds, challenging the notion that nature utilizes only a limited, well-mapped area of fold space. The C proteins cluster in three groups, comprising measles, Nipah, and Sendai virus. We predicted that all C proteins have a similar organization: a variable, disordered N-terminus and a conserved, a-helical Cterminus. We confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant C proteins from Tupaia paramyxovirus (measles group) and human parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai group). We also found that the C of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity, indicating a common origin. Although the C of the Sendai group lack sequence similarity with them, we speculate that they also have a common origin, given their similar genomic location and structural organization. Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae. Intriguingly, in measles virus and Nipah virus, PNT encodes STAT1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the C-terminus of C, indicating they have probably originated independently. This arrangement, in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif (a STAT1-binding site) and a highly constrained region (the C-terminus of C), seems paradoxical, since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt. The fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage, perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations.

d179adef5b8b2c84baa05a6d0e14a12f9e11c27c	Current evidence suggests that Echinacea supplementation may decrease the duration and severity of acute respiratory tract infections; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Few adverse events were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. Because Echinacea can increase immune function, there is a concern that it could worsen over-activation of the immune system in cytokine storm; however, clinical trials show that Echinacea decreases levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm. Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents.

8586ac6debb079c48da68c3073203a22e0de67a0	Decades of research on differences in the language of men and women have established postulates about preferences in lexical, topical, and emotional expression between the two genders, along with their sociological underpinnings. Using a novel dataset of male and female linguistic productions collected from the Reddit discussion platform, we further confirm existing assumptions about gender-linked affective distinctions, and demonstrate that these distinctions are amplified in social media postings involving emotionally-charged discourse related to COVID-19. Our analysis also confirms considerable differences in topical preferences between male and female authors in spontaneous pandemic-related discussions.
ab6d4e29549359ce647a22e67e1e83c4873ce388	Consider the situation where an analyst has a Bayesian statistical model that performs well for continuous data. However, suppose the observed data set consists of multiple response types (e.g., continuous, count-valued, Bernoulli trials, etc.), which are distributed from more than one class of distributions. We refer to these types of data as "multi-response" data sets. The goal of this article is to introduce a reasonable easy-to-implement all-purpose method that "converts" a Bayesian statistical model for continuous responses (call this the preferred model) into a Bayesian model for multi-response data sets. To do this, we consider a transformation of the data, such that the transformed data can be be reasonably modeled using the preferred model. What is unique with our strategy is that we treat the transformations as unknown and use a Bayesian approach to model this uncertainty. The implementation of our Bayesian approach to unknown transformations is straightforward, and involves two steps. The first step produces posterior replicates of the transformed data from a latent conjugate multivariate (LCM) model. The second step involves generating values from the posterior distribution implied by the preferred model. We demonstrate the flexibility of our model through an application to Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), spatial mixed effects (SME) models, and the multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM). To further illustrate the potential wide use of this approach, we provide an analysis of zero-inflated records of public costs due to natural disasters obtained from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association's (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
2b66ed26516699b02d14bcf0d59671fb611f12ca	 The effects of climatology factors and population density on the infection rate of the COVID 19 are investigated.  Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and virus optimization algorithms (VOA) are used.  Population density shows the most significant effect on the infection rate.  An increase in maximum temperature reduces the infection rate. Recently, a novel coronavirus virus disease (COVID-19) has become a serious concern for global public health hazards. Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 can also 3 significantly affect the sustainable development of urban areas. Several factors such as population density and climatology parameters could potentially affect the spread of the COVID-19. In this study, a combination of the virus optimization algorithm (VOA) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to investigate the effects of various climaterelated factors and population density on the spread of the COVID-19. For this purpose, data on the climate-related factors and the confirmed infected cases by the COVID-19 across the U.S counties was used. The results show that the variable defined for the population density had the most significant impact on the performance of the developed models, which is an indication of the importance social distancing in reducing the infection rate and spread rate of the COVID-19. Among the climatology parameters, an increase in the maximum temperature was found to reduce the infection rate. Average temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, and average wind speed were not found to significantly affect the spread of the COVID-19 while an increase in the relative humidity was found to slightly increase the infection rate. The findings of this research show that it could be expected to have reduced infection rate over the summer season. However, it should be noted that the models developed in this study were based on limited onemonth data. Future investigation can benefit from using more comprehensive data covering a wider range for the input variables.
4a5bedf760df7254411080fa445a34f5d964f054	There is a growing interest in One Health, reflected by the rising number of publications relating to One Health literature, but also through zoonotic disease outbreaks becoming more frequent, such as Ebola, Zika virus and COVID-19. This paper uses bibliometric analysis to explore the state of One Health in academic literature, to visualise the characteristics and trends within the field through a network analysis of citation patterns and bibliographic links. The analysis focuses on publication trends, co-citation network of scientific journals, cocitation network of authors, and co-occurrence of keywords. The bibliometric analysis showed an increasing interest for One Health in academic research. However, it revealed some thematic and disciplinary shortcomings, in particular with respect to the inclusion of environmental themes and social science insights pertaining to the implementation of One Health policies. The analysis indicated that there is a need for more applicable approaches to strengthen intersectoral collaboration and knowledge sharing. Silos between the disciplines of human medicine, veterinary medicine and environment still persist. Engaging researchers with different expertise and disciplinary backgrounds will facilitate a more comprehensive perspective where the human-animal-environment interface is not researched as separate entities but as a coherent whole. Further, journals dedicated to One Health or interdisciplinary research provide scholars the possibility to publish multifaceted research. These journals are uniquely positioned to bridge between fields, strengthen interdisciplinary research and create room for social science approaches alongside of medical and natural sciences. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof the characteristics and trends within the field through a network analysis of citation patterns and bibliographic links. A bibliometric analysis is a quantitative method to capture, in this case, the networks of journals, authors and occurrences of keywords. By investigating these citation indices, it is possible to get an overview of the academic features and dynamics, the strengths and the shortcomings, that characterise a particular scientific field (3). Previous bibliometric studies have investigated the use of One Health documents, examining journals over time, tracking the increase of public health research involving animals, or investigating the issue of citation indices in relation to veterinary medicine and One Health publications (4-6). This paper is the first to use bibliometric analysis to explore One Health contributions across disciplines and sectors. The study documents an increased academic attention for the One Health concept across multiple disciplines and sectors. However, the bibliometric analysis revealed some thematic and disciplinary shortcomings, in particular with respect to the incl usion of environmental themes and social science insights pertaining to the implementation and management of One Health policies. Rigid silos J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof sample. Second, the abstract of the remaining contributions (1.417) were manually screened to determine whether One Health was included as a concept or was just a generic syntax. This screening exercise led to 937 contributions being discarded. The final sample consisted of 1.067 contributions pertaining to the concept of One Health. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof FAO, OiE, and the World Bank. Generally, the network shows that the field is dominated by the WHO and Zinsstag (red and purple cluster), these clusters are also the most central to the flow of information in the network. Scholars within the biodiversity and ecohealth cluster are less connected with the other clusters but especially scholars in the green cluster are more isolated from the other clusters. More specific, the network shows that, Degeling and Steve Hinchliffe are often cited together with Zinsstag by other authors, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof indicating similar characteristics in their research. The network also shows that Zinsstag is often cited with the Schelling and Roth, which again signifies that the authors share similar properties. The organisations in the network are also co-cited by each other. Especially the WHO was co-cited heavily within the network. Notably, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is not cited together with the American counterpart, the CDC. Further, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), an EU funded agency that provides independent scientific advice on food security, animal and plant health shows no direct connection to the ECDC or any other organisations. It indicates that the two European institutions are not commonly cited together despite covering similar One Health topics. Within the bibliometric analysis, the co-occurrence of Keywords Plus in the reviewed articles is analysed to reveal topics and concepts that are the most mentioned and interconnected. The clustering algorithm produces five distinct thematic clusters within the network (red: microbiology; blue: medical science; green: veterinary science; orange: public health management; purple: anthropology). Figure 5 illustrates that the blue 'medical science'-cluster is very central, connecting to all other disciplines and showing strong relations within and outside the cluster. Most central keywords are prevalence, epidemiology, infection, risk factors and disease. The green cluster of veterinarian science is also central in the network with many and strong links to the other clusters. The microbiology cluster is also a prominent cluster in the network, although it is primarily a self-referential cluster with limited keyword links to other thematic clusters. The public health management and anthropology clusters are the least prominent clusters. In the anthropology cluster, there are only seven nodes, which are sparsely distributed with distant connections and no central nodes. The orange cluster is more central but key concepts such as strategies, knowledge, management and attitudes play a peripheral role. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof There has been a steady increase of One Health articles, in particular in the wake of the FAO/OiE/WHO collaboration in 2010. External pressures primarily in the form of disease outbreaks such as Ebola and Zika virus also appear to have facilitated further research into One Health. In short, more and more scholars appear to display an interest in the holistic approach of One Health. While this is indeed a welcome development, the bibliometric analysis reveals certain shortcomings in the academic field of One Health that can be structured around three important dimensions: 1) diversity of sectors and disciplines; 2) themes and interfaces addressed; 3) scholars and institutions involved. The citation network of journals showed that One Health is heavily researched in the sciences, particularly in the fields of microbiology, parasitology, infectious diseases and general sciences. The mostly cited journals for One Health themes are the epidemiological journal Emerging Infectious Diseases and the medical journal PLOS One. This is certainly merited, as many One Health issues directly concern humans and animals, such as infectious diseases, foodborne illnesses and antimicrobial resistance. Comprehensive research in these areas is crucial to combat health challenges within a One Health approach. However, One Health is also a tool to inform policy-makers, to manage infectious disease outbreaks, to implement strategies and to enhance institutionalisation (1). The current COIVID-19 pandemic has made it painstakingly clear that attention to these broader sets of socio-economic issues are essential in public health responses. Scholars have long expressed concern of silo research in One Health, advocating for more interdisciplinary research to include diverse perspectives (e.g. social, political, anthropological) (14,21-24). The network analysis indicates that there is a general lack of journals for the type of interdisciplinary research that is promoted by the One Health approach. The network analysis does identify some interdisciplinary journals well-positioned to capture broader socio-economic and management perspectives such as Social Science & Medicine and Ecohealth. Interestingly, the bibliometric analysis did not reveal One J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Health research in monodisciplinary social science outlets such as political science, global governance or public administration. Neither did it reveal dedicated One Health outlets. There are a few established One Health journals such as One Health Outlook published by BioMed Central and the present One Health outlet published by Elsevier for the International Federation for Tropical Medicine. However, these journals are recently established and have not yet made it into the WoS. Stronger cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary One Health research can be promoted by either expanding the thematic areas in existing journals or by increasing the engagement of other types of journals such as those dedicated to One Health or interdisciplinary journals. One Health journals can provide a platform that encourages holistic research from multiple angles, combining quantitative and qualitative research that investigates One Health issues not only as medical and biological themes, but as political as well as socio-cultural themes. Social and political contributions can foster One Health institutionalisation and facilitate policy dialogue. However, the journal network reveals few journals that bridge not just disciplines but whole research traditions, most notably between the medical and social sciences. Hence, interdisciplinary work should be encouraged, as it can promote collaboration, communication as well as knowledge sharing across scientific traditions, disciplines and sectors. One Health and broader public health outlets can facilitate the understanding of complex problems and promote the development of innovations also in the fields of implementation, management, strategy or institutionalisation. One of the defining features of a One Health approach is the attention paid to the nexus between human, animal and environment. However, the field of environment is often disregarded in much One Health research. The colour coding of the co-citation networks of journals and authors reveal that environmental perspectives are dwarfed in comparison to epidemiological, microbiological and public health perspectives. Additionally, the co-occurrence of keywords shows that keywords relating to environment, ecology and biodiversity are scarce. These finding are in line with Khan et al. and Lebov et al. who both found that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof strategy to inform policy-making (16). Lebov et al. have also devised concrete planning guidelines for One Health researchers on how to construct an interdisciplinary and holistic study design that covers all three health domains (24). Further, guidance documents such as the 2019 published tripartite guide should be considered when implementing One Health activities (2). 3) Scholars and institutions J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The study reveals a high degree of author proximity within and across departments and universities. The physical and academic closeness of the most active scholars might indicate the presence of homophily. Homophily is the tendency of individuals to associate and interact with other individuals similar to them (28). The proximity might increase effectiveness and create synergies, but risks resulting in a lack of diversity in approaches and themes (29). Some of these themes might be the environmental issues or social science perspectives. The citation network also illustrates the centrality of organisations such as the WHO, FAO, CDC, OiE and the World Bank. These organisations appear to have a key role in scientific communication. The organisations have been working together, sharing information, which pushed forward the One Health approach and contributed to the recognition of the approach. This is illustrated by the increase in publications of One Health articles after their engagement in 2010. Especially the WHO is co-cited heavily by various authors and institutes, which is reflective of the institute's engagement with research and guidance on One Health related topics. However, these international organisations appear to completely dominate the policycluster at the expense of academic scholars. Thus, there is clearly an opportunity for academic scholars to engage more with the policy field of management, implementation, strategies and policy collaboration in the context of One Health. Furthermore, to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and to strengthen the engagement of the environment field into One Health, the FAO/OiE/WHO collaboration could involve the environmental sector. For example, the United Nations Environment Programme could be engaged to push forward and connect human and animal health to the environment. Maybe the tripartite could evolve to a quadripartite agreement? The co-citation network for the ECDC, EFSA and CDC indicates that although they all contribute to similar research areas, only limited connections between them could be traced in their research. The lack of co-citations indicates a potential barrier for cooperation beyond the limits of the own organisation. The organisations share core principles of the One Health approach but appear to work in epistemological and/or institutional silos, as evidenced by limited cross-citations between organisations. To facilitate cross-institutional collaboration on One Health research, more focus could be on activities that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof not only promote interdisciplinarity but cross-institutional engagements such as hosting One Health workshops with broad participation, establishing cross-organisational research groups and encouraging coauthored research projects. It is essential to take advantage of the current momentum to advance the One Health approach. The momentum is not only reflected by the rising number of publications relating to One Health literature, but also through zoonotic disease outbreaks becoming more frequent, such as Ebola, Zika virus and the current case of COVID-19. The bibliometric analysis showed the potential and increasing interest for One Health. However, it also revealed little engagement with the environmental sector. It indicated that there is a need for more applicable approaches to strengthen intersectoral collaboration and knowledge sharing. Engaging researchers with different expertise and disciplinary backgrounds will facilitate a more comprehensive perspective where One Health is researched in an interdisciplinary way that conceives of the humananimal-environment interface not as separate entities but as a coherent whole. Existing frameworks and guidelines should be used to promote One Health activities. Further, journals dedicated to One Health or interdisciplinary research provide scholars the possibility to publish multifaceted research. Journals, such as this one, are uniquely positioned to bridge between fields and strengthen interdisciplinary research. With case studies of One Health implementation and themes of governance as well as interdisciplinary collaboration, the journals can also create room for social science approaches alongside of medical and natural sciences. Despite the success of One Health, there is a need to pay attention to the persistent challenges of integrating social science disciplines, the environmental sector and researchers from diverse disciplines. Nevertheless, the One Health approach has the potential to be established as a comprehensive research field, engaging multifaceted expertise across disciplines.

04ed44ad0aed30771e1ba0f38e4aa00101d1b8c3	As the predominant aetiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed that a monovalent formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine efforts. Here, we test the hypothesis that increasing virus input titres in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine may result in broad nAb responses. We show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response. Thus, we have generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to numerous and diverse HRV types.
4d124b37e288a897cd92c9513f7f6915858b1d0b	Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by cells that have an important biological function in intercellular communication by transferring biologically active proteins, lipids, and RNAs to neighboring or distant cells. While a role for exosomes in antimicrobial defense has recently emerged, currently very little is known regarding the nature and functional relevance of exosomes generated in vivo, particularly during an active viral infection. Here, we characterized exosomes released into the airways during influenza virus infection. We show that these vesicles dynamically change in protein composition over the course of infection, increasing expression of host proteins with known anti-influenza activity, and viral proteins with the potential to trigger host immune responses. We show that exosomes released into the airways during influenza virus infection trigger pulmonary inflammation and carry viral antigen that can be utilized by antigen presenting cells to drive the induction of a cellular immune response. Moreover, we show that attachment factors for influenza virus, namely α2,3 and α2,6-linked sialic acids, are present on the surface of airway exosomes and these vesicles have the ability to neutralize influenza virus, thereby preventing the virus from binding and entering target cells. These data reveal a novel role for airway exosomes in the antiviral innate immune defense against influenza virus infection.

We analyzed admitted patients' clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019. Total admissions experienced a reduction of 45% during the lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (16 vs 29, respectively), as well as a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS>10) at admission (n=8, 50% vs n=8, 28%). A dramatic prevalence of stroke of unknown symp tom onset was observed in 2020 (n=8, 50% vs n=3, 10%). During lockdown, worse functional and independence outcomes were found, despite the similar proportion of reperfused patients. Similar 'symptoms alert-to-admission' and 'door-to-treatment' times were observed. During lockdown hospitalization was shorter and fewer patients completed the stroke work-up. In conclusion, the adopted strategies for stroke management during the COVID-19 emergency have suggested being effective, while suffering a reduced and delayed reporting of symptoms. Therefore, we recommend raising awareness among the population against possible stroke symptoms onset. Thus, think F.A.S.T. and do not stay-at-home at all costs.

dca12728182107f40c7e34a928175d694752a3a9	The interest around the graphene family of materials is constantly growing due to their potential application in biomedical fields. The effect of graphene and its derivatives on cells varies amongst studies depending on the cell and tissue type. Since the toxicity against non-adherent cell lines has barely been studied, we investigated the effect of graphene and two different graphene oxides against four multiple myeloma cell lines, namely KMS-12-BM, H929, U226, and MM.1S, as well as two non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells lines, namely KARPAS299 and DOHH-2. We performed two types of viability assays, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide conversion) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate detection), flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis induction and cell cycle, cell morphology, and direct interaction analysis using two approaches-visualization of living cells by two different systems, and visualization of fixed and dyed cells. Our results revealed that graphene and graphene oxides exhibit low to moderate cytotoxicity against cells, despite visible interaction between the cells and graphene oxide. This creates possibilities for the application of the selected graphene materials for drug delivery systems or theragnostics in hematological malignancies; however, further detailed studies are necessary to explain the nature of interactions between the cells and the materials.

Sepsis consequently has a high mortality rate and a high rate of complications for survivors, despite modern medical advances. therefore, drug identification and validation for the treatment of sepsis is of the utmost importance. As a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, rolipram also exhibits the abilities of inhibiting multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines production in macrophages and toxin-induced inflammation in mice. However, this drug has never been studied as a sepsis treatment method. We found that rolipram significantly improves survival in mice challenged with gram-negative bacterium E. coli, cLp, or E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide. We have also found that rolipram inhibits organ damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and intracellular migration of early-stage inflammatory elements. Our results also show that rolipram increases anti-inflammatory cytokine production. The protective effects of rolipram on septic mice may result from inhibition of the MAP kinase and NF-κB signaling pathways. Rolipram may therefore be a potential novel sepsis treatment, one that would bypass the time-consuming and costly drug-discovery process. Sepsis is triggered by an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response to pathogenic microorganisms, and may lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. Sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality, even under optimal conditions of critical care. It is the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units 1 . The hospital case-fatality rate of severe sepsis patients has been estimated at approximately 25%, while close to 50% of septic shock patients die 2 . Most importantly, the incidence of sepsis has risen by nearly 30% in the past decade 3 . Because sepsis can be induced by different microorganisms, vaccine development is difficult to impossible. Moreover, the abuse of antibiotics in the hospital setting has induced drug resistance in common pathogens. Therefore, despite enormous advancements in understanding the pathogenesis of sepsis, drug treatment remains largely ineffective. The identification, validation, and development of more effective drug treatments is extremely important. While sepsis can be induced by a number of traumatic and/or pathogenic events, it is commonly induced by a host inflammatory reaction to a number of different microbes and their products 3-6 . Gram-negative bacteria are the leading cause of infection in both hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, and is itself the biggest player in induction of this antibacterial immune response 7 . LPS induces inflammation by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 on the host cell surface. Upon activation of this receptor, the adaptor protein MyD88 is recruited to the receptor, which in turn triggers a cascade of signaling events that leads to the transcription of the transcription factor NF-κB and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. A subsequent series of downstream pro-inflammatory reactions leads to the expression of cytokines, chemokines, stress-responsive proteins, and other inflammatory elements 8 . NF-κB plays a pivotal role in the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6. MAP kinases, including extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, also modulate cytokine expression at multiple levels. ERK is required 1 open Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:175 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56899-6 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ for the transportation of TNF-α mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm 9 . p38 is a critical mediator of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and has been identified as the target of a class of small-molecule inhibitors capable of inhibiting this process 10,11 . LPS-induced transcription and translation of inflammatory mediators leads to inflammatory reactions, organ damage, and ultimately shock in the host 12 . Rolipram is a typical phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, which can inhibit TNF production in activated mouse macrophages. Furthermore, studies have shown that rolipram markedly restrains carrageenan-induced acute inflammatory responses in mice 13 . Both human and animal experiments have shown that rolipram is also an effective antidepressant, indicating significant bioavailability and effectiveness in the blood 14,15 . However, rolipram has never been studied as a sepsis treatment. We therefore hypothesized, based on preliminary results, that rolipram may protect mice from E. coli induced septic shock and E. coli derived LPS resultant massive inflammatory response. Our findings indicate that rolipram may protect mice from sepsis and septic shock-like symptoms induced by E. coli, CLP, or E. coli derived LPS, through inhibition of the NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways. Rolipram is already approved and in use for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder in the United States. As a result, if rolipram is shown to be a viable sepsis treatment in future experiments, significant time and money that would otherwise be spent on the drug-discovery process may be avoided altogether.

e8b2520f8223794e5e6afed548d688f0f74f189e	A seroprevalence study can estimate the percentage of people with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population. Most existing reports have used a convenience sample, which may bias their estimates. Objective: To estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 based on a random sample of adults living in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. Design: Cross-sectional. We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020 and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies between June 10 and July 6, 2020. Participants: 505 respondents, aged ≥18 years, residing in non-congregate settings who completed both the survey and the serology test. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies among the overall population and across pre-specified subgroups. We also assessed the prevalence of symptomatic illness, risk factors for virus exposure, and self-reported adherence to risk mitigation behaviors among this population. Of the 505 respondents (mean age 50 [±17] years; 54% women; 76% non-Hispanic White individuals) included, 32% reported having at least 1 symptom suggestive of COVID-19 since March 1, 2020. Overall, 18 respondents had SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in the state-level weighted seroprevalence of 3.1 (90% CI 1.4-4.8). Individuals who were asymptomatic had significantly lower seroprevalence (0.6% [90% CI 0.0-1.5]) compared with the overall state estimate, while those who reported having had ≥1 and ≥2 symptoms had a seroprevalence of 8.0% (90% CI 3.1-12.9) and 13.0% (90% CI 3.5-22.5), respectively.
384f32cfc1c0011b6984771ca33a225e9ded6f48	Background: Viral upper respiratory tract infection (vURI) may or may not present with a cold/flu-like illness (CFLI). Objectives: For common upper respiratory viruses that cause vURIs, to determine the relative frequencies of virus detection by PCR in subjects with and without CFLIs. Study design: Prospective follow-up of 170 children aged 1-8.6 years through the CFLI season by daily parental diary for CFLI episodes and nasal secretion sampling using PCR assays for adenovirus, coronavirus (types 229E and OC43), influenza virus (types A and B), parainfluenza (types 1-3) virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Results: Virus was detected in 415 of 956 independent assays: 425 CFLI episodes and 531 non-CFLI periods were sampled; samples from 270 (64%) CFLI episodes and 145 (27%) non-CFLI periods contained virus detected by PCR. Rhinovirus was most frequently detected at 64%, followed by mixed viruses at 12%, RSV at 7%, and the other viruses at 3-5% of all detections. About 85% of RSV, influenza A and adenovirus detections were associated with a CFLI, whereas less than 62% of other virus detections were associated with CFLI. Conclusions: The frequency of PCR virus detection without CFLI was different among viruses. This introduces virus-specific biases to estimating the frequencies of specific complications attributable to a vURI when ascertained by CFLI identification.
ac2d8a1d73af15edaac54abaca97b45d5dcd285b	In this Letter we show that multiband observations of stellar-mass binary black holes by the next generation of ground-based observatories (3G) and the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) would facilitate a comprehensive test of general relativity by simultaneously measuring all the post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients. Multiband observations would measure most of the known PN phasing coefficients to an accuracy below a few percent-two orders-of-magnitude better than the best bounds achievable from even 'golden' binaries in the 3G or LISA bands. Such multiparameter bounds would play a pivotal role in constraining the parameter space of modified theories of gravity beyond general relativity. Introduction: Gravitational wave (GW) observations have provided a first glimpse of the strong-field dynamics of binary black holes (BBHs) [1, 2]. They have also allowed us to place the first ever constraints on the possible departures from general relativity (GR) [3, 4] in this regime. Parametrized tests of the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to GR [5][6][7][8] are among the most important theory-agnostic, null-tests of GR that are performed using GW observations. These tests make use of the analytical prediction of the structure of the phase evolution using the PN approximation to GR [9]. In the PN approximation the dynamics of the binary is treated as an adiabatic process and Einstein's field equations are solved under the assumption of slow motion and weak gravitational fields. This is an excellent approximation for the "inspiral" phase of the compact binary dynamics where the two stars spiral-in under the influence of radiation back reaction, but the time-scale of radiation reaction is large compared to the orbital time-scale. Gravitational waveform from a compact binary coalescence, in the frequency domain, have the well-known form [10] 
bac5b2d4132134fc849f70a3340f68c9be8f3163	There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after bariatric surgery. Four gastric bypass operations, performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were complicated with COVID-19. The mean age and body mass index were 46 ± 12 years and 49 ± 3 kg/m 2 . Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery. One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery. Three patients were readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. In two patients who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents were also administered. All patients survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery. Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.
6f6a250f3aff31bb8315d124050ec9d064d2cd50	Introduction: Neonates are less responsive to vaccines than adults, making it harder to protect newborns against infection. Neonatal differences in antigen-presenting cell, B and T cell function, all likely contribute. A key question is whether novel adjuvants might be able to make neonatal vaccines more effective. Areas covered: This review addresses the issues of how to improve neonatal vaccines, which we have defined as vaccines given in the first 4 weeks of life in a human infant or the first week of life in a mouse. A search was performed using keywords including 'neonatal immunity', 'neonatal immunisation', 'vaccine' and 'adjuvant' of PubMed articles published between 1960 and 2018. Expert opinion: Sugar-like structures have recently been shown to prime the infant adaptive immune system to respond to vaccines, being potentially more effective than traditional adjuvants. Sugar-based compounds with beneficial adjuvant effects in neonatal vaccine models include delta inulin (Advax), curdlan, and trehalose 6,6ʹ-dibehenate. Such compounds make interesting neonatal adjuvant candidates, either used alone or in combination with traditional innate immune adjuvants. ARTICLE HISTORY
5f89b412b92800d560575f03614b9f798b7a8835	The objective of this study was to apply the pertinent findings from gamma inactivation of virus infectivity to the production of high quality diagnostic reagents. A Gammacell 220 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ottawa, Canadas) was used to subject 38 viruses grown in either susceptible tissue cultures or embryonated chicken eggs to various doses of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source. The radiation required to reduce viral infectivity was 0.42 to 3.7 megarads (Mrad). The effect of gamma treatment on the antigenic reactivity of reagents for the complement fixation (CF), hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminadase assays was determined. Influenza antigens inactivated with 1.7 Mrad displayed comparable potency, sensitivity, specificity and stability to those inactivated by standard procedures with beta-propiolactone (BPL). Significant inactivation of influenza Nl and B neuraminidase occurred with >2.4 Mrad radiation at temperatures above 4°C. All 38 viruses were inactivated, and CF or HA antigens were prepared successfully. Antigenic potency remained stable with all antigens for 3 years and with 83% after 5 years storage. Influenza HA antigens evaluated after 9 years of storage demonstrated 86% stability. Gamma radiation is safer than chemical inactivation procedures and is a reliable and effective replacement for BPL in preparing diagnostic reagents,
55844fc8a5cb75ffa1a249436ad30d6d93792df5	Background: On 31 March 2013, the first human infections with the novel influenza A/H7N9 virus were reported in Eastern China. The outbreak expanded rapidly in geographic scope and size, with a total of 132 laboratoryconfirmed cases reported by 3 June 2013, in 10 Chinese provinces and Taiwan. The incidence of A/H7N9 cases has stalled in recent weeks, presumably as a consequence of live bird market closures in the most heavily affected areas. Here we compare the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other emerging pathogens and evaluate the impact of intervention measures in an effort to guide pandemic preparedness. We used a Bayesian approach combined with a SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) transmission model fitted to daily case data to assess the reproduction number (R) of A/H7N9 by province and to evaluate the impact of live bird market closures in April and May 2013. Simulation studies helped quantify the performance of our approach in the context of an emerging pathogen, where human-to-human transmission is limited and most cases arise from spillover events. We also used alternative approaches to estimate R based on individual-level information on prior exposure and compared the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other recent zoonoses. Results: Estimates of R for the A/H7N9 outbreak were below the epidemic threshold required for sustained human-to-human transmission and remained near 0.1 throughout the study period, with broad 95% credible intervals by the Bayesian method (0.01 to 0.49). The Bayesian estimation approach was dominated by the prior distribution, however, due to relatively little information contained in the case data. We observe a statistically significant deceleration in growth rate after 6 April 2013, which is consistent with a reduction in A/H7N9 transmission associated with the preemptive closure of live bird markets. Although confidence intervals are broad, the estimated transmission potential of A/H7N9 appears lower than that of recent zoonotic threats, including avian influenza A/H5N1, swine influenza H3N2sw and Nipah virus. Conclusion: Although uncertainty remains high in R estimates for H7N9 due to limited epidemiological information, all available evidence points to a low transmission potential. Continued monitoring of the transmission potential of A/H7N9 is critical in the coming months as intervention measures may be relaxed and seasonal factors could promote disease transmission in colder months.
86436b22b4e572a03f1a6411469224d9b47e3286	Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. A SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The majority of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units with confirmed severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 developed an acute respiratory distress like syndrome. The main objective of this opinion paper is to raise the discussion about the possible benefit of keeping the patient with COVID-19 disease and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in the prone position during the perioperative period, especially where this position is not a required factor for the surgical or invasive procedure. We believe that the prone position, due to its favorable pulmonary physiology, can improve the V / Q ratio in the perioperative period.
453f11e130ec3975f27d601da20140338101dc15	Investigating type I feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) in tissue culture is critical for understanding the basic virology, pathogenesis, and virus-host interactome of these important veterinary pathogens. This has been a perennial challenge as type I FCoV strains do not easily adapt to cell culture. Here we characterize replication kinetics and plaque formation of a model type I strain FIPV Black in Fcwf-4 cells established at Cornell University (Fcwf-4 CU). We determined that maximum virus titers (> 10 7 pfu/mL) were recoverable from infected Fcwf-4 CU cellfree supernatant at 20 h post-infection. Type I FIPV Black and both biotypes of type II FCoV formed uniform and enumerable plaques on Fcwf-4 CU cells. Therefore, these cells were employable in a standardized plaque assay. Finally, we determined that the Fcwf-4 CU cells were morphologically distinct from feline bone marrow-derived macrophages and were less sensitive to exogenous type I interferon than were Fcwf-4 cells purchased from ATCC. 1991; Pedersen et al., 1984) , but a recent study proposes a more https://doi.
3acbd6e6bb0e683cf6818c1ac8e761d9ac9911d8	Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) present distinct physiological and social considerations for the emergency physician. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these considerations may generate unique challenges for emergency physicians managing patients with SCIs. Physiological disruptions may alter the way SCI patients present with COVID-19. The same disruptions can affect management of this vulnerable patient group, perhaps warranting early aggressive treatment. The medical picture will often be complicated by unique social characteristics. The reliance on caregivers for activities of daily living can, as an example, increase the human resource requirement of an ED. Considering the vulnerabilities and complexities of patients with SCI, the community should prioritise prevention of COVID-19 infections in this group. In the event that they do present to an ED, planning for and understanding their complexities will facilitate optimal management.
6ead974b5b07697c36ad42b5f58d9a75c6e2fe75	Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is one of the most important vector-borne viruses in Europe and Asia. Its transmission mainly occurs by the bite of an infected tick. However, consuming milk products from infected livestock animals caused TBEV cases. To better understand TBEV transmission via the alimentary route, we studied viral infection of human intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 cells were used to investigate pathological effects of TBEV infection. TBEV-infected Caco-2 monolayers showed morphological changes including cytoskeleton rearrangements and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Ultrastructural analysis revealed dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and further enlargement to TBEV containing caverns. Caco-2 monolayers maintained an intact epithelial barrier with stable transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) during early stage of infection. Concomitantly, viruses were detected in the basolateral medium, implying a transcytosis pathway. When Caco-2 cells were pre-treated with inhibitors of cellular pathways of endocytosis TBEV cell entry was efficiently blocked, suggesting that actin filaments (Cytochalasin) and microtubules (Nocodazole) are important for PI3Kdependent (LY294002) virus endocytosis. Moreover, experimental fluid uptake assay showed increased intracellular accumulation of FITC-dextran containing vesicles. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed co-localization of TBEV with early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) as well as with sorting nexin-5 (SNX5), pointing to macropinocytosis as trafficking mechanism. In the late phase of infection, further evidence was found for translocation of virus via the paracellular pathway. Five days after infection TER was slightly decreased. Epithelial barrier integrity was impaired due to increased epithelial apoptosis, leading to passive viral translocation. These findings illuminate pathomechanisms in TBEV infection of human intestinal epithelial cells and viral transmission via the alimentary route.
12e39ce894b904578ed6742f5c0de2fca576ad6f	HTLV-1 was the first described human retrovirus and was soon found to be associated with severe clinical diseases, including a devastating lymphoma/leukemia and other inflammatory diseases. Although HTLV-2 is not usually pathogenic, it is widely distributed among native Indian populations in Brazil, particularly in the Amazon region of the country. Presently, HTLV spreads mainly by the sexual route and from mother to child, and virus persistence is an active biological factor aiding its transmission. Recently, the use of illicit drugs has been shown to be an additional risk factor, showing the influence of new habits on the epidemiology of HTLV in the region. Despite the detection of the virus in several different populations in the Amazon region of Brazil for almost 30 years, the exact prevalence of HTLV-1/2 is not well defined. The original biases in sampling and the selection of epidemiologically unsuitable populations were commonly repeated in most prevalence studies, generating unreliable and conflicting figures that do not represent the actual prevalence of HTLV. The improvements in clinical and laboratory facilities have resulted in the description of several clinical manifestations that were previously unknown in the region. The extent of the spread of the virus must be defined in this region, which is the largest geographical area of the country. As prophylaxis advances toward the use of vaccines against HTLV-1, it is important to determine who is at risk of being infected and developing a disease to successfully implement preventive measures, particularly as proposals are made to eradicate the virus among humans.
c86dde4e07e6c295d41960bdde42d9196918a2dd	Scientific conferences provide valuable opportunities for researchers across career stages and disciplines to present their latest work and to network with their peers. The advent of the internet has opened new possibilities for interaction, collaboration and networking, yet the uptake of tools enabling remote participation at scientific meetings has been slow. Academic conferences have become more international with high proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees, but the format and quality of their organization lags behind what is possible. As a result, the experience of attending conferences in many disciplines today is not appreciably different in many respects. A few conferences in some disciplines have recently implemented valuable changes for the community and have become more receptive to attendees with families. Many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and more importantly, reducing the meetings' carbon footprint. These issues are openly visible and to some extent discussed among researchers on social media. It is important to accelerate and mandate these efforts so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We examined the current state of over 260 national and international academic meetings in various disciplines for features of inclusivity and sustainability and propose solutions to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet.

cfb06153bd9db651c6c7c268aecf6e65113fe008	Background: Coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV) and mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) have evolved strategies to disable the innate immune system for productive replication and spread of infection. We have previously shown that papain-like protease domain 2 (PLP2), a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of MHV-A59, encodes a deubiquitinase (DUB) and inactivates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) thereby the type I interferon (IFN) response. Principal Findings: Here we provide further evidence that PLP2 may also target TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1), the upstream kinase of IRF3 in the IFN signaling pathway. Overexpression experiments showed that PLP2 deubiquitinated TBK1 and reduced its kinase activity, hence inhibited IFN-b reporter activity. Albeit promiscuous in deubiquitinating cellular proteins, PLP2 inactivated TBK1 and IFN-b response in TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) deficient cells, suggesting that targeting TBK1 would be sufficient for PLP2 to inhibit IRF3 activation. This notion was further supported by in vitro kinase assays, in which prior treatment of TBK1 with PLP2 inhibited its kinase activity to phosphorylate IRF3. Intriguing enough, results of PLP2 overexpression system and MHV-A59 infection system proved that PLP2 formed an inactive complex with TBK1 and IRF3 in the cytoplasm and the presence of PLP2 stabilized the hypo-phosphorylated IRF3-TBK1 complex in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: These results suggest that PLP2 not only inactivates TBK1, but also prevents IRF3 nuclear translocation hence inhibits IFN transcription activation. Identification of the conserved DUB activity of PLP2 in suppression of IFN signaling would provide a useful clue to the development of therapeutics against coronaviruses infection.
486c1c6061e21e0ee4a901d503f5a7c46efe5427	The NMR structure of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein 7 (nsp7) in aqueous solution at pH 6.5 was determined and compared with the results of previous structure determinations of nsp7 in solution at pH 7.5 and in crystals of a hexadecameric nsp7/nsp8 complex obtained from a solution at pH 7.5. All three structures contain four helices as the only regular secondary structures, but there are differences in the lengths and sequence locations of the four helices, as well as between the tertiary folds. The present study includes data on conformational equilibria and intramolecular rate processes in nsp7 in solution at pH 6.5, which provides further insights into the polymorphisms implicated by comparison of the presently available three nsp7 structures.
44346ee6a8dc71d2d78915a44b407ef7cee177a9	The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in different countries around the world. Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols, facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification, are urgently needed. Given the situation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that "in settings where facemasks are not available, healthcare personnel might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for the care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort." Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, there are a series of non-medical materials available on the market, such as household air filters, coffee filters, and different types of fabrics, which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials. The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size-dependent filtration performances. The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials. The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance. Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes, it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators.
e27b2ec189028052ab97b7b959087ac012222a98	The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among the singlestranded positive-sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3=-to-5= exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV highfidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication. IMPORTANCE Uniquely among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] either are nonviable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we showed that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt during long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoNinactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogues that is explained only partially by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogues is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.

28776e324c2128443197d2c9bc2a9eaa77ed1bf5	Isothermal amplification assays, such as loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), show great utility for the development of rapid diagnostics for infectious diseases because they have high sensitivity, pathogen-specificity and potential for implementation at the point of care. However, elimination of non-specific amplification remains a key challenge for the optimization of LAMP assays. Here, using chlamydia DNA as a clinically relevant target and high-throughput sequencing as an analytical tool, we investigate a potential mechanism of non-specific amplification. We then develop a real-time digital LAMP (dLAMP) with high-resolution melting temperature (HRM) analysis and use this single-molecule approach to analyze approximately 1.2 million amplification events. We show that single-molecule HRM provides insight into specific and non-specific amplification in LAMP that are difficult to deduce from bulk measurements. We use real-time dLAMP with HRM to evaluate differences between polymerase enzymes, the impact of assay parameters (e.g. time, rate or florescence intensity), and the effect background human DNA. By differentiating true and false positives, HRM enables determination of the optimal assay and analysis parameters that leads to the lowest limit of detection (LOD) in a digital isothermal amplification assay.
5fa5da191afa08a15b9d31969d8e3c6a736f7447	With impact of COVID-19 gradually increasing in many countries of the world with each passing day, there is a need to relook into the conservative management for some common sports related injuries. Awareness of all kinds of sports injuries, their symptoms, and preventive measures including education on rehydration, nutrition, monitoring team members, behavioural skills and techniques will further help in preventing the potential sporting injuries. Further, telemedicine and online portals including eSanjeevani outpatient department services should be encouraged. Level of Evidence: Level V (Editorial) With impact of COVID-19 gradually increasing in many countries of the world with each passing day, there is a dearth of health resources available to effectively manage the COVID scenario. With fear of phase-III transmission looming over developing countries like India, and the availability of vaccine still more than 6 months away, elective surgeries still remain no brainers to be pondered upon. But what about the injuries sustained while playing sports? Do they need to be looked upon again and a suitable protocol be made to deal with such problems as various sportspersons all over the world, who were either awaiting the surgeries from pre-COVID times or sustained during the unlocking period are at a great loss citing the highly competitive nature of the sports and fear of losing their place in the team or falling behind in practise sessions. In this context of uncertainty and future prevalence of the COVID scenario, it is necessary that we should establish uniform treatment protocols, to safely resume the sporting activities and to prevent the injuries in the near future, in observance with the principle of 'maximal caution'. Awareness of all kinds of sports injuries, their symptoms, and preventive measures including education on rehydration, nutrition, monitoring team members, behavioural skills, techniques and treatment is of prime importance. Telemedicine and applications such as eSanjeevani outpatient department services where an individual can assess a specialised doctor should be popularised widely. Conservative management for some commonly occurring problems should be the treatment of choice in some scenarios including: Knee injuries (ligament or meniscal injuries): Neuromuscular electric stimulation of quadriceps, quadriceps strengthen exercises, neuromuscular training and focus on maintaining limb symmetry. With this non-operative treatment many athletes can even return to sports without surgery 1 . However, one should avoid return to sports if athletes experiences give away feeling during pivoting and cutting movement. Shoulder dislocation: Patients with recurrent shoulder dislocation can be treated conservatively with aim of prevention further episodes of dislocation. Pendulum exercises from day 1 after reduction, abduction up to 90 degree in internal rotation and zero degree of external rotation for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks free active and passive movements, patients can return to sports after 3 weeks 2 . Back injury: Backache is very common among the athletes reason for backache among the athletes are acute muscle spasm, degenerative disc disease and stress fracture in pars interarticularis. However, rest can improve the symptoms but doesn't address the underlying J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 pathology. It was observed that strengthening of core muscles decreases the pain and decrease the chances of these injuries in future 3 . Sprains: rest and anti-inflammatory medications. Return to sports should be gradual over few weeks 4 . Strains: rest, anti-inflammatory medications, adequate warming up exercises during practise, strengthening and conditioning exercises 4 . Knockouts and Punch Syndrome: forms the rare emergencies and should be managed on urgent basis at a specialised centre 4 . Tennis Elbow: rest, anti-inflammatory medications, activity modification and physical therapy 4 . Javelin Throwers Elbow: rest, anti-inflammatory medications, modifying technique which places a repetitive and prolonged strain on the forearm muscles, strengthening and conditioning exercises 4 . Boxers elbow: rest, anti-inflammatory medications, activity modification, strengthening exercises and working on wrist flexion exercises will help to strengthen tendons 4 . Runners Knee: rest, ice, compression, elevation, anti-inflammatory medications and physiotherapy 5 . Jumpers Knee: activity modification, anti-inflammatory medications and physiotherapy 5 . Shin Splints: Wearing proper footwear and modifying exercise routine, anti-inflammatory medications and physiotherapy 5 . The aim of this letter is a call for action for all the sports medicine community to recommend a uniform management of sports injuries and to treat them in a conservative way.

Canadians have valid concerns about delays related to their changing needs as millions move their purchases from food services to retail groceries, but they should not worry about our overall supply of calories. Despite some shortages, the supply chains for flour and cooking oil are not likely to be blocked for an extended period. Learning from the coordinated needs of the BSE crisis in the beef sector, the federal government developed Value Chain Roundtables in 2003, including one for grains. These roundtables bring together government and industry to tackle the issues that face each sector's major needs, including food safety, transportation infrastructure, and market access. A working group made up of various roundtable members was set up specifically to deal with COVID-19-related supply chain challenges. This gives both industry and government a venue to attack any choke point or breakdown within our agri-food supply chains -the exact response we need at this time. A pre-established forum for discussion of critical issues at these roundtables, assuming the right players are active and present, cannot hurt, but it would useful for future planners and researchers if the federal government could clarify any positive impact they have.
c348e752bd75d70836f7b24f4d77f59c3e2ae366	Three subtypes of influenza A virus cause human disease: H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2. Although all result in respiratory illness, little is known about how these subtypes infect differentiated airway epithelia. Therefore, we assayed A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2), and X31 (H3N2) influenza virus strains for binding and infection on fully differentiated primary cultures of airway epithelia isolated from human bronchus, grown on semiporous filters at an air-liquid interface. In this model system, viral infectivity was highest when virus was applied to the apical versus the basolateral surface; Japan was most infectious, followed by PR8. The X31 strain showed very low levels of infectivity. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence-resonance energy transfer studies indicated that Japan virus could enter and fuse with cellular membranes, while infection with X31 virions was greatly inhibited. Japan virus could also productively infect human trachea explant tissues. These data show that influenza viruses with SA␣2,3Gal binding specificity, like Japan, productively infect differentiated human airway epithelia from the apical surface. These data are important to consider in the development of pseudotyped recombinant viral vectors for gene transfer to human airway epithelia for gene therapy.
2b7e25165c47ed61e78a9bfe6ede3028f3729a54	Two full-length porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) genomes, strain VR-2332 and its cell culture passaged descendent RespPRRS vaccine strain, were compared and analyzed in order to identify possible sites of attenuation. Of the 41 nucleotide changes, 12 resulted in conservative changes and 18 produced non-conservative changes. The results suggest that key amino acids in ORF1 may contribute to the phenotype of RespPRRS, which includes increased growth rate on MA-104 cells and decreased virulence in swine. The results provide a genetic basis for future manipulation of a PRRSV reverse genetics system.
7914e27a08f6ae8eb1b96279af0db6da1da8e517	Summary：The immune effect of two recombinant protein fragments of spike protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) was investigated in Balb/c mice. Two partial spike gene fragments S1 (322-1464 bp) and S2 (2170-2814 bp) of SARS coronavirus were amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into pET-23a prokaryotic expression vector, then transformed into competent Escherichia E.coli BL21 (DE3)(pLysS) respectively. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified by Ni 2+ immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The purified proteins mixed with complete Freund adjuvant were injected into Balb/c mice three times at a two-week interval. High titer antibody was detected in the serum of immunized Balb/c mice, and mice immunized with S1 protein produced high titer IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, while those immunized with S2 protein produced high titer IgG1, IgG2a, but lower titer IgG2b and IgG3. Serum IFN-γ concentration was increased significantly but the concentrations of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 had no significant change. And a marked increase was observed in the number of spleen CD8+ T cells. The results showed that recombinant proteins of SARS coronavirus spike protein induced hormonal and cellular immune response in Balb/c mice.
ad63e6c4585346d7c23cdf6d2c68813c16cc940d	Background. Pneumonia, the leading infectious cause of child mortality globally, mainly afflicts developing countries. This prospective observational study aimed to assess the microorganisms associated with pneumonia in children aged <5 years in developing and emerging countries. Methods. A multicenter, case-control study by the GABRIEL (Global Approach to Biological Research, Infectious diseases and Epidemics in Low-income countries) network was conducted between 2010 and 2014 in Cambodia, China, Haiti, India (2 sites), Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, and Paraguay. Cases were hospitalized children with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were children from the same setting without any features suggestive of pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all subjects; 19 viruses and 5 bacteria were identified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Associations between microorganisms and pneumonia were quantified by calculating the adjusted population attributable fraction (aPAF) after multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, time period, other pathogens, and site. Results. Overall, 888 cases and 870 controls were analyzed; ≥1 microorganism was detected in respiratory samples in 93.0% of cases and 74.4% of controls (P < .001). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 3, and 4, and influenza virus A and B were independently associated with pneumonia; aPAF was 42.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.5%-48.2%) for S. pneumoniae, 18.2% (95% CI, 17.4%-19.0%) for RSV, and 11.2% (95% CI, 7.5%-14.7%) for rhinovirus. Conclusions. Streptococcus pneumoniae, RSV, and rhinovirus may be the major microorganisms associated with pneumonia infections in children <5 years of age from developing and emerging countries. Increasing S. pneumoniae vaccination coverage may substantially reduce the burden of pneumonia among children in developing countries.
f37b9d719084246f733cb9abf22ca7c8587d1a7c	The COVID-19 epidemic was reported in the Hubei province in China in December 2019 and then spread around the world reaching the pandemic stage at the beginning of March 2020. Since then, several countries went into lockdown. Using a mechanistic-statistical formalism, we estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number R e of the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (R e = 0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45-0.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0-4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of R e is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities.
042298e80948b1be8323bb04441dabefea9fc7ab	Methods: We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with infl uenza A(H5N1) confi rmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identifi ed. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0-7). Times to fi rst dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n 5 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality 5 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia ( Ն 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81-5.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal , 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively. Fibrinogen concentrations were mostly low/normal at 129.9 to 517.9 mg/dL (median 241.1, normal 200-400 mg/dL), whereas C-reactive protein (9/11) and ferritin (6/8) levels were increased. Risk factors for death (univariate analysis) included: (1) increased D-dimers, (2) hyperglycema, (3) increased urea, (4) more extensive chest radiograph shadowing, and (5) lower admission oxygen saturation. Conclusions: Early diagnosis and effective treatment of human infl uenza A(H5N1) infection remains challenging. Most patients were referred late with advanced disease. Oseltamivir had limited clinical impact. Elevated D-dimer levels, consistent with fi brinolysis, and hyperglycemia warrant more research to determine their underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment.

Effects of MS disease-modifying therapies on responses to vaccinations: a review. 2 Abstract Development of long-term immunologic memory relies upon humoral and cellular immune responses. Vaccinations aim to stimulate these responses against pathogens. Several studies have evaluated the impact of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies on immune response to vaccines. Findings from these studies have important implications for people with multiple sclerosis who require vaccination and are using disease-modifying therapies. Searches using PubMed and other engines were conducted in May 2020 to collect studies evaluating the impact of various disease-modifying therapies on immune responses to vaccination. Several studies demonstrated preserved immune responses in people treated with beta-interferons to multiple vaccine types. Limited data suggest vaccine responses to be preserved with dimethyl fumarate treatment, as well. Vaccine responses were reduced to varying degrees in those treated with glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, and natalizumab. The timing of vaccination played an important role in those treated with alemtuzumab. Humoral vaccine responses were significantly impaired by B cell depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapies, particularly to a neoantigen. Data are lacking on vaccine responses in patients with multiple sclerosis taking cladribine and high-dose corticosteroids. Notably, the majority of these studies have focused on humoral responses, with few examining cellular immune responses to vaccination. Ciotti JR, Valtcheva MV, Cross AH. Effects of MS disease-modifying therapies on responses to vaccinations: a review. 3 Prior investigations into the effects of individual disease-modifying therapies on immune responses to existing vaccines can serve as a guide to expected responses to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Responses to any vaccination depend on the vaccine type, the type of response (recall versus response to a novel antigen), and the impact of the individual disease-modifying therapy on humoral and cellular immunity in response to that vaccine type. When considering a given therapy, clinicians should weigh its efficacy against MS for the individual patient versus potential impact on responses to vaccinations that may be needed in the future.

c5f40869abc913991ba9461378f45c9e7cfd30d7	Background: Frequently occurring drought stress negatively affects the production of maize worldwide. Numerous efforts have been made to develop drought-tolerant maize lines and to explore drought tolerant mechanisms in maize. However, there is a lack of comparative studies on transcriptomic changes between drought-tolerant and control maize lines. Results: In the present study, we have developed a drought-tolerant maize mutant (C7-2t) by irradiating the seeds of maize inbred line ChangC7-2 (C7-2) with 60 Co-γ. Compared to its wild type C7-2, C7-2t exhibited a significantly delayed wilting and higher drought tolerance under both the controlled and field conditions, indicating its high water-holding ability. Transcriptomic profiling was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between C7-2 and C7-2t during drought. As a result, a total of 4552 DEGs were implied in drought tolerance of C7-2 and C7-2t. In particular, the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in C7-2 was inhibited, whereas these genes in C7-2t were almost unaffected under drought. Moreover, a specific set of the DEGs were involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and taurine (hypotaurine) metabolism in C7-2t; these DEGs were enriched in cell components associated with membrane systems and cell wall biosynthesis. Conclusions: The drought tolerance of C7-2t was largely due to its high water-holding ability, stable photosynthesis (for supporting osmoregulation) and strengthened biosynthesis of cell walls under drought conditions.
bd877345472e96bd0c01fbb169d47f2fdaad740b	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2). The SARS CoV-2 is transmitted more rapidly and readily than SARS CoV. Both, SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 via their glycosylated spike proteins recognize the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. We generated multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for representative spike proteins of SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 from various host sources in order to analyze the specificity in SARS CoV-2 spike proteins required for causing infection in humans. Our results show that among the genomes analysed, two sequence regions in the N-terminal domain (NTD); "MESEFR" and "SYLTPG" are specific to human SARS CoV-2. In the receptor binding domain (RBD), two sequence regions; "VGGNY" and "EIYQAGSTPCNGV" and a disulfide bridge connecting 480C and 488C in the extended loop are structural determinants for the recognition of human ACE-2 receptor. The complete genome analysis of representative SARS CoVs from bat, civet, human host sources and human SARS CoV-2 identified the bat genome (GenBank code: MN996532.1) as closest to the recent novel human SARS CoV-2 genomes. The bat SARS CoV genomes (GenBank codes: MG772933 and MG772934) are evolutionary intermediates in the mutagenesis progression towards becoming human SARS CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. CoV-2 is transmitted from person to person contact via respiratory secretions during coughing and sneezing. Infection of this highly pathogenic virus can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome which impacts the lung and heart functions. The prominent symptoms of this viral infection are flu, severe respiratory, enteric and neurological disorders, resulting in increased white blood cells and kidney failure. There are no vaccines or drugs available to combat this deadly infectious disease and there is no strategic plan to treat the infected patients. Hence, there is a need to develop specific anti-SARS CoV-2 vaccines and drugs to treat infected patients, in order to reduce viral shedding and further transmission in populations. The SARS CoV-2 comprises positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of size 29-30 kb and belongs to the coronaviridae family and betacoronavirus sub-family. Mammals such as bats are the main reservoir of betacoronaviruses, but due to the zoonotic contacts and viral genomic mutations, SARS CoV-2 has recently crossed species and caused infections in humans. 3 Research findings have pointed that previous zoonotic CoV infections such as, SARS CoV, that first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002 was transmitted from bats and civets 4-8 , the MERS CoV that originated in bats was first This article is protected by copyright.

A sequence motif "PRRA", from 681P to 684A (amino acid numbering is according to NCBI code: QHD43416) that is gained only in the human SARS CoV-2 spike proteins is referred to as furin cleavage site. [28][29] In this work, we identify the sequence regions in human SARS CoV-2; a six residues insertion sequence "MESEFR" from 153M to 158R and another six residues insertion sequence "SYLTPG" from 247S to 252G. The bat SARS CoV spike protein QHR63300 (GenBank code: MN996532.1) also comprises the identical sequence regions as above. In two bat spike proteins, AVP78042 (GenBank code: MG772934) and AVP78031 (MG772933), a six residues sequence "SIREFA" and a three residues sequence "GDP" are present at equivalent positions, respectively. The insertion sequence regions present in human SARS CoV-2, 153MESEFR158 and 247SYLTPG252 are associated with the NTD and are located distant from the ACE-2 binding site. From the three-dimensional structure of human SARS CoV-2, we infer that these regions are likely to be exposed towards the surface of the spike protein in NTD. In human SARS CoV-2, there are two insertion regions; a five residues insertion "VGGNY" from 445V to 449Y, and a thirteen residues insertion "EIYQAGSTPCNGV" from 471E to 483V. The bat SARS CoV spike protein QHR63300 has also gained equivalent insertions with the sequences; "EGGNF" and "EIYQAGSKPCNGQ". It is interesting to note that the bat SARS CoV QHR63300 has already acquired a thirteen residues sequence region, whereas all other spike proteins that recognize the ACE-2 receptor in SARS CoV comprise a twelve residues sequence region. The Figure 2A was generated by editing the MSA in Figure   S1 to depict the sequence regions discussed above in representative spike proteins from the four host sources (bat, civet, human SARS CoV and human SARS CoV-2). The two sequence regions, "VGGNY" and "EIYQAGSTPCNGV", are part of the RBD and involved in recognition of the ACE-2 receptor in human host. Their absence in the bat SARS CoV at equivalent positions may be responsible for their inability to bind human ACE-2. To study this, we have analyzed the three-dimensional structures of human SARS CoV (PDB code: 6ACG) 30 and the RBD domain of human SARS CoV-2 (6M17) complexed with ACE-2 This article is protected by copyright.

ce7ff7a79e44b02a63df2cb0beed9046f7acde10	Multi-criteria decision-making methods are tools that facilitate and help to make better and more responsible decisions. Their main objective is usually to establish a ranking of alternatives, where the best solution is in the first place and the worst in the last place. However, using different techniques to solve the same decisional problem may result in rankings that are not the same. How can we test their similarity? For this purpose, scientists most often use different correlation measures, which unfortunately do not fully meet their objective. In this paper, we identify the shortcomings of currently used coefficients to measure the similarity of two rankings in decision-making problems. Afterward, we present a new coefficient that is much better suited to compare the reference ranking and the tested rankings. In our proposal, positions at the top of the ranking have a more significant impact on the similarity than those further away, which is right in the decisionmaking domain. Finally, we show a set of numerical examples, where this new coefficient is presented as an efficient tool to compare rankings in the decision-making field. (MCDA) methods and decision support systems enjoy deep interest both in the world of business and science. Almost in every case, a reliable decision requires the analysis of many alternatives. Each of them should be assessed from the perspective of all the criteria characterizing its acceptability. As the complexity of the problem increases, it becomes more and more challenging to make the optimal decision. An additional complication is that there is no complete mathematical form depending on the criteria and the expected consequences. In particularly important problems, the role of the decision-maker is entrusted to an expert in a given field or to a group of experts who will help to identify the best solution. We talk about individual or group decision making, respectively. Even then, it can often be problematic for an individual expert as well as for collegiate bodies to determine the right decision. In this case, MCDA methods can be helpful. MCDA methods are great tools to support the decision-maker in the decisionmaking process. We can identify two main groups of MCDA methods, i.e., American and European schools [33]. Methods of the American school of decision support are based on the utility or value function [5,16]. The most important methods belonging to this family are: analytic hierarchy process (AHP) [34], analytic network process (ANP) [35], utility theory additive (UTA) [21], simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) [28], technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) [3,32], or measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique (MACBETH) [2]. Methods of European school of decision support use outranking relation in the preference aggregation process, where the most popular are ELECTRE family [1,36] and PROMETHEE methods [8,15]. Additionally, we can indicate the set of techniques based strictly on the rules of decision making. These methods use the fuzzy sets theory (COMET) [12,25-27] and the rough set theory (DRSA) [29]. Generally, MCDA methods help to create a ranking of decision variants where the most preferred alternative comes first [4] . The problem arises when we use more than one MCDA method, and the rankings obtained are not identical. Then the question arises on how to compare the received rankings? Currently, the most popular approach is the analysis based on the correlation between the two or more rankings [7, 12, 19, 24] . However, we are going to show that this analysis is insufficient in the decision support domain. An appropriate approach should ensure that a better ranking in terms of the order can be identified. Then, with a proper benchmark, it would be possible to assess the correctness of the MCDA methods in terms of the rankings generated [22] . In this paper, we identify the shortcomings of currently used coefficients to measure the similarity of two rankings. The most significant contribution is the WS coefficient, which depends strictly on the position on which the difference in the ranking occurred. Afterward, three linguistic terms are identified by using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, i.e., low, medium, and high similarity. We compare the proposed coefficient with ρ Spearman, τ Kendall, and γ Goodman-Kruskal coefficients, which are commonly used to measure rankings similarity in MCDA problems [9, 12, 17, 18, 23] . In addition, the proposed approach is compared with
d931dcba5e7ae4361afc140d8d80920285edc264	Type I interferon (IFN) comprises a class of cytokines first discovered more than 50 years ago and initially characterized for their ability to interfere with viral replication and restrict locally viral propagation. As such, their induction downstream of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is a hallmark of the host antiviral response. The acknowledgment that several PAMPs, not just of viral origin, may induce IFN, pinpoints at these molecules as a first line of host defense against a number of invading pathogens. Acting in both autocrine and paracrine manner, IFN interferes with viral replication by inducing hundreds of different IFN-stimulated genes with both direct anti-pathogenic as well as immunomodulatory activities, therefore functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. On the other hand an inverse interference to escape the IFN system is largely exploited by pathogens through a number of tactics and tricks aimed at evading, inhibiting or manipulating the IFN pathway, that result in progression of infection or establishment of chronic disease. In this review we discuss the interplay between the IFN system and some selected clinically important and challenging viruses and bacteria, highlighting the wide array of pathogen-triggered molecular mechanisms involved in evasion strategies.
04d67ad1ca54ce997715a0afe908fd60ddfb067d	NETosis is a type of regulated cell death dependent on the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET), where net-like structures of decondensed chromatin and proteases are produced by polymorphonuclear (PMN) granulocytes. These structures immobilise pathogens and restrict them with antimicrobial molecules, thus preventing their spread. Whilst NETs possess a fundamental anti-microbial function within the innate immune system under physiological circumstances, increasing evidence also indicates that NETosis occurs in the pathogenic process of other disease type, including but not limited to atherosclerosis, airway inflammation, Alzheimer's and stroke. Here, we reviewed the role of NETosis in the development of organ injury, including injury to the brain, lung, heart, kidney, musculoskeletal system, gut and reproductive system, whilst therapeutic agents in blocking injuries induced by NETosis in its primitive stages were also discussed. This review provides novel insights into the involvement of NETosis in different organ injuries, and whilst potential therapeutic measures targeting NETosis remain a largely unexplored area, these warrant further investigation.
722a9c0570574ff652c4cf4c7ba325e62608c594	Due to the present COVID-19 pandemic, forensic mental telehealth assessment (FMTA) is an increasingly utilized means of conducting court-sanctioned psychiatric and psychological evaluations. FMTA is not a novel development, and studies have been published during the past two decades that opine on the positive and negative implications of conducting testing and interview procedures online, in forensic and traditionally clinical matters alike. The present article examines the prospects for eventual legal challenges to FMTA, describes considerations for conducting FMTA in both institutional and residential settings, and concludes that FMTA is now-due to predicted accommodations on the part of courts, attorneys, institutions, and professional guilds-a permanent part of the forensic evaluation landscape, even once the present COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.
2d5745abc30fbf8c050d4b68278ac8d6fe00bb90	The worldwide population aged ≥ 65 years is increasing and the average life span is expected to increase another 10 years by 2050. This extended lifespan is associated with a progressive decline in immune function and a paradoxical state of low-grade, chronic inflammation that may contribute to susceptibility to viral infection, and reduced responses to vaccination. Here we review the effects of aging on innate immune responses to viral pathogens including elements of recognition, signaling, and production of inflammatory mediators. We specifically focus on age-related changes in key pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways, converging on altered cytokine responses, including a notable impairment of antiviral interferon responses. We highlight an emergent change in innate immunity that arises during agingthe dampening of the dynamic range of responses to multiple sources of stimulationwhich may underlie reduced efficiency of immune responses in aging.

Surprisingly, a majority of these long-term viral RNA shedders were not hospitalized (61 of 99), with variable PCR Crossing point values over the month post diagnosis. For the 851-patient cohort, the mean lower bound of viral RNA shedding was 17.3 days (SD: 7.8), and the mean upper bound of viral RNA shedding from 668 patients transitioning to confirmed PCR-negative status was 22.7 days (SD: 11.8). Among 104 patients with an IgG test result, 90 patients were seropositive to date, with mean upper bound of time to seropositivity from initial diagnosis being 37.8 days (95%CI: 34.3-41.3). Juxtaposing IgG/PCR tests revealed that 14 of 90 patients are non-hospitalized and seropositive yet shed viral RNA. This study emphasizes the need for monitoring viral loads and neutralizing antibody titers in long-term shedders.
169dfee7f1e122f4a0ad22d736964ca90b28f76d	Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by. Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable "realtime" monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach.

d31b2db65b2e8d40eee096d5e67185099c10c4d2	Here, we found that HSV-2 does not allow induction of an autophagic response to infection, but maintains basal autophagy levels mostly unchanged during productive infection. Thus, we investigated the importance of basal autophagy for HSV-2 infection, using pharmacological autophagy suppression or cells genetically deficient in an autophagy-essential gene (ATG5). Interference with basal autophagy flux in cells significantly reduced viral replication and diminished the infection. These results indicate that basal autophagy plays an indispensable role required for a productive infection. Importantly, this study draws a sharp distinction between induced and basal autophagy, where the former acts as a viral clearance mechanism abrogating infection, while the latter supports infection. Human herpesvirus-2, also known as Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), is a double-stranded DNA virus that affects over 16% of the global population aged 15-49 years, causing an immense epidemic 1,2 . HSV-2 primarily causes severe genital diseases associated with physical disorders (e.g. genital ulcers and inflammation) and psychosocial problems 3,4 . HSV-2 genital disease represents a top-alert condition due to the fact that the virus may be transmitted from mothers to neonates causing a neonatal infection with high mortality rate 5,6 and the fact that HSV-2 infection is a serious risk factor for HIV infection, enhancing HIV acquisition rate by 3-4 fold 7,8 . Moreover, HSV-2 was also found to contribute to corneal infections and other ocular pathologies 9,10 , or may cause meningitis 3,4,11 . Autophagy is a cellular catabolic pathway which degrades various cytoplasmic constituents such as misfolded proteins and protein aggregates, intracellular organelles or microbial pathogens 12,13 . During autophagy, the cargo to be degraded is recruited through autophagy receptors to the autophagic vesicles (autophagosomes) which eventually fuse with lysosomes, releasing their cargo that is then lysosomally degraded 12-14 . During conditions of nutrient deficiency, autophagy is induced to maintain energy pools in the cell, and prevent translational arrests, cell cycle delays or cell death [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . At the basal levels, autophagy plays other important homeostatic functions such as clearance of protein aggregates, and damaged organelles 12-14 . Disruption of autophagy sometimes results in the failure to adapt to stress conditions or starvation and may cause death of the cell or organism under such conditions 15,19 . HSV-1 and HSV-2 are closely related herpesviruses that rely on ICP34.5 protein as a major neurovirulence and neurotropism factor 20,21 . HSV-1 virus was shown to establish virulence via preventing launch of an autophagic response to infection, as HSV-1 ICP34.5 binds to and inhibits the autophagy mediator beclin1 22-25 . HSV-2 ICP34.5 shares some common features with HSV-1 ICP34.5 and also shows differences 26-28 . For example, HSV-2 ICP34.5 gene, contrary to HSV-1 ICP34.5, contains an intron and undergoes alternative splicing, yielding various structurally unique splice-variants 27 and protein products 28 . However, whether HSV-2 ICP34.5 inhibits autophagy responses in cells, similarly to HSV-1 ICP34.5, remains to be established. Very little is known about the role of autophagy in HSV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated the role of autophagy in regulating HSV-2 infection. Our results demonstrate that basal autophagy, which is maintained at stable levels during productive HSV-2 infection, is required for successful HSV-2 infection, as its disruption prevented infection to a great extent.
58e339228b3f311db6d8b6646adf480ccd3c3a57	Molecular assays have resulted in increased detection of viral respiratory infections, including virus coinfection, from children with acute respiratory infections. Yet the clinical severity of virus coinfection compared to single virus infection remains uncertain. We performed a retrospective study of children presenting with acute respiratory infections comparing clinical severity of single respiratory virus infection to virus coinfection, detected on midturbinate swabs by molecular assays. Patient characteristics and measures of clinical severity were abstracted from health records. A total of 472 virus-infected children were included, 391 with a single virus infection and 81 with virus coinfection. Virus status did not affect admission to hospital (odds ratio (OR) = 0.8; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.5-1.4; p 0.491) or clinical disease severity among inpatients (OR = 0.8; 95% CI 0.5-1.5; p 0.515) after adjusting for age and underlying comorbidities. However, children infected with rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/ENT) alone were more likely to be admitted to the hospital compared to those coinfected with HRV/ENT and at least another virus, although this was not significant in multivariable analyses (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22-1.0; p 0.051). In multivariable analyses, children coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viruses were significantly more likely to present with radiologically confirmed pneumonia compared to those with an isolated RSV infection (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.07-9.34, p 0.037). Equivalent clinical severity was observed between children with single virus infection and virus coinfection, although children coinfected with RSV and other viruses presented more frequently with pneumonia than those with single RSV infection. Increased disease severity observed among children with single HRV/ENT infection requires further investigation. Clinical Microbiology and Infection CMI Asner et al.

ef410688aa7e605811d4c681be5211c19f4af137	Two common viral pathogens of swine, namely, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were investigated in regard to their effects on monolayer cultures of swine alveolar macrophages (AMs). The purpose was to identify selected cellular changes and responses potentially associated with the clinical reactions of pigs infected with either or both of these viruses. Measurements included the (1) absolute and relative numbers of infected, viable, and apoptotic cells; (2) distribution of viral antigens; (3) levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-a) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) produced and their association with the extent of virus-induced cytopathology. Four groups of AMs were studied, including mock-infected, PCV2 alone-infected (PCV2-A), PRRSV alone-infected (PRRSV-A), and PCV2 and PRRSV dually infected (PCV2/PRRSV) groups. The AMs of PCV2-A group had high antigen-containing rate without cell death. There was a marked increase in cell death and apoptosis in PRRSV-A group. However, a lower PRRSVinduced infectious rate, cell death, and apoptosis were seen in PCV2/PRRSV group. High levels of IFN-a production were detected in PCV2-infected groups, but not in mock-infected and PRRSV-A groups. The PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MARC-145 cells or swine AMs was markedly reduced by pre-incubation of the cells with UV-treated or non-UVtreated supernatants of PCV2-infected AMs. In addition, the reduction in CPE was abolished when the supernatants of PCV2-infected AMs were pre-treated with a mouse anti-recombinant porcine IFN-a antibody. The results suggest that swine AMs were an important reservoir of PCV2; PCV2 infection reduced PRRSV infection and PRRSV-associated CPE in PCV2/ PRRSV AMs; the reduction of PRRSV infection in AMs was mediated by IFN-a generated by PCV2 infection.

881e4255d6283d8659104e34e724476c27c62a8d	Prenatal COVID-19 infection is anticipated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to affect fetal development similarly to other common respiratory coronaviruses through effects of the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6-16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants' level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (> 7.5 mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (<7.5 mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels >7.5µM, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed.
a399f129fbe5b2c9d09d0117e602d0d102e2e533	Following the emergence of Hendra virus (HeV), private veterinarians have had to adopt additional infection control strategies to manage this zoonosis. Between 1994 and 2010, seven people became infected with HeV, four fatally. All infected people were at a higher risk of exposure from contact with horses as they were either veterinary personnel, assisting veterinarians, or working in the horse industry. The management of emerging zoonoses is best approached from a One Health perspective as it benefits biosecurity as well as a public health, including the health of those most at risk, in this case private veterinarians. In 2011 we conducted a cross-sectional study of private veterinarians registered in Queensland and providing veterinary services to horses. The aim of this study was to gauge if participants had adopted recommendations for improved infection control, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the development of HeV specific management strategies during the winter of 2011. A majority of participants worked in practices that had a formal HeV management plan, mostly based on the perusal of official guidelines and an HeV field kit. The use of PPE increased as the health status of an equine patient decreased, demonstrating that many participants evaluated the risk of exposure to HeV appropriately; while others remained at risk of HeV infection by not using the appropriate PPE even when attending a sick horse. This study took place after Biosecurity Queensland had sent a comprehensive package about HeV management to all private veterinarians working in Queensland. However, those who had previous HeV experience through the management of suspected cases or had attended a HeV specific professional education programme in the previous 12 months were more likely to use PPE than those who had not. This may indicate that for private veterinarians in Queensland personal experience and face-to-face professional education sessions may be more effective in the improvement of HeV management than passive education via information packages. The role of different education pathways in the sustainable adoption of veterinary infection control measures should be further investigated.

2dc623e0fed100b9e166ece1962fd0fb0b5cbeb5	Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C proteinase is a member of the picornain cysteine proteases responsible for the processing of the viral polyprotein, a function essential for viral maturation and infectivity. This and its structural similarity to other 3C and 3C-like proteases make it an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. Previous solution NMR studies have shown that a Cys24Ser (C24S) variant of HAV 3C protein, which displays catalytic properties indistinguishable from the native enzyme, is irreversibly inactivated by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-serineb-lactone (1a) through alkylation of the sulfur atom at the active site Cys172. However, crystallization of an enzyme-inhibitor adduct from the reaction mixture followed by X-ray structural analysis shows only covalent modification of the 32-nitrogen of the surface His102 by the b-lactone with no reaction at Cys172. Re-examination of the heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) NMR spectra of the enzyme-inhibitor mixture indicates that dual modes of single covalent modification occur with a R3:1 ratio of S-alkylation of Cys172 to N-alkylation of His102. The latter product crystallizes readily, probably due to the interaction between the phenyl ring of the N-benzyloxycarbonyl (N-Cbz) moiety and a hydrophobic pocket of a neighboring protein molecule in the crystal. Furthermore, significant structural changes are observed in the active site of the 3C protease, which lead to the formation of a functional catalytic triad with Asp84 accepting one hydrogen bond from His44. Although the 3C protease modified at Cys172 is catalytically inactive, the singly modified His102 N 32 -alkylated protein displays a significant level of enzymatic activity, which can be further modified/inhibited by N-iodoacetyl-valinephenylalanine-amide (IVF) (in solution and in crystal) or excessive amount of the same b-lactone inhibitor (in solution). The success of soaking IVF into HAV 3C-1a crystals demonstrates the usefulness of this new crystal form in the study of enzyme-inhibitor interactions in the proteolytic active site.
c6ffc647a841257cc40d125408caca01651ee7ba	The pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. Blood donors comprise approximately 4.7% of the similarly aged population of Denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country. The objective of this study was to perform real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. All Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to 17 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7% (CI: 0.9-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 (CI: 59-154) infections. The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR, including only individuals with no comorbidity, is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. This may have implications for risk mitigation. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.
8eb4f69bf719bb209575132a945a6899ebaa0fd1	Outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for patients with adult T cell leukemia/ lymphoma (ATL) are not satisfactory, particularly in patients in non-complete remission at transplantation (Pt-non-CR). We conducted a regional retrospective study in the ATL endemic area of Okinawa, Japan. Of 62 ATL patients, 21 received allo-HSCT in CR and 41 in non-CR. The 3-year overall survival (3yOS) rate and median survival time for the whole cohort was 25.6% and 7.7 months, respectively. The 3yOS of Pt-non-CR was significantly lower than that of patients in CR (Pt-CR) (16.8% vs. 43.6%, P = 0.005). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher in Pt-non-CR than in Pt-CR (46.3% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.025), while there was no significant difference in disease-associated mortality (DAM) between Ptnon-CR and Pt-CR. Multivariable analysis for Pt-non-CR revealed that poor performance status (poor-PS) and higher sIL-2R level (high sIL-2R) adversely affected OS. Poor-PS was associated with higher TRM, but not with higher DAM in Pt-non-CR. High sIL-2R did not affect TRM or DAM in Pt-non-CR. Overall, high TRM rates rather than DAM contribute to the poor outcomes of Pt-non-CR, suggesting that not only disease control but also management of transplant-related complications is required for allo-HSCT in ATL patients.

6e2b81ea145f20bad9129013f611181c0fe4ad8a	Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection causes severe inflammation and is a highly contagious disease in poultry. Virulent NDV strains (GM) induce large quantities of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is the central mediator of the inflammatory reaction. Excessive expression of IL-1β exacerbates inflammatory damage. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced IL-1β expression can aid in further understanding the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease. Here, we showed that anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibody treatment decreased body temperature and mortality following infection with virulent NDV. We further explored the primary molecules involved in NDV-induced IL-1β expression from the perspective of both the host and virus. This study showed that overexpression of NLRP3 resulted in increased IL-1β expression, whereas inhibition of NLRP3 or caspase-1 caused a significant reduction in IL-1β expression, indicating that the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis is involved in NDV-induced IL-1β expression. Moreover, ultravioletinactivated GM (chicken/Guangdong/GM/2014) NDV failed to induce the expression of IL-1β. We then collected virus from GM-infected cell culture supernatant using ultracentrifugation, extracted the viral RNA, and stimulated the cells further with GM RNA. The results revealed that RNA alone was capable of inducing IL-1β expression. Moreover, NLRP3/ caspase-1 was involved in GM RNA-induced IL-1β expression. Thus, our study elucidated the critical role of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease while also demonstrating that inhibition of IL-1β via anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibodies decreased the damage associated with NDV infection; furthermore, GM RNA induced IL-1β expression via NLRP3/caspase-1. © The Author(s) 2020.

89d27a03696c2c515c9477eb696580d6041835e0	Numerous peripheral tissues possess self-sustaining daily biologic rhythms that are regulated at the molecular level by clock genes such as PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1. Physiological function of nasal mucosa exhibits rhythmic variability to a day-night environmental cycle. Nevertheless, little is known of the expression and distribution pattern of clock genes in nasal mucosa. The present study investigates the expression level and distribution pattern of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes in nasal mucosa of healthy controls, allergic rhinitis patients, and normal rats. In human and rat nasal mucosa, the levels of these genes are asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from right and left cavities in normal controls, allergic patients, and rat. In human nasal mucosa, the expression levels of these genes were higher in the decongested side than the congested mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, these clock genes are expressed in a rhythmic circadian manner under the regular light/dark cycles. The expression levels of MUC5AC, a key mucin genes produced in superficial epithelium, are higher in decongested side than that congested side in human nasal mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, MUC5AC levels showed a circadian rhythm which was associated with different expression levels in nasal mucosa derived from the right and left nasal cavities. Taken together with these results, the present study shows that the clock genes such as PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 are present in human and rat nasal mucosa, and suggest that these clock genes may control the pathophysiological function of nasal mucosa as circadian oscillators and affect the maintenance of the nasal cycle.
69e0c456d9b38f6894c1b0a3d52e7a9fd3154dae	A randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of early enteral nutrition (EN) on intestinal permeability, intestinal protein loss, and outcome in parvoviral enteritis. Dogs were randomized into 2 groups: 15 dogs received no food until vomiting had ceased for 12 hours (mean 50 hours after admission; NPO group), and 15 dogs received early EN by nasoesophageal tube from 12 hours after admission (EEN group). All other treatments were identical. Intestinal permeability was assessed by 6-hour urinary lactulose (L) and rhamnose (R) recoveries (%L, %R) and L/R recovery ratios. Intestinal protein loss was quantified by fecal ␣ 1 -proteinase inhibitor concentrations (␣ 1 -PI). Median time to normalization of demeanor, appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea was 1 day shorter for the EEN group for each variable. Body weight increased insignificantly from admission in the NPO group (day 3: 2.5 Ϯ 2.8%; day 6: 4.3 Ϯ 2.3%; mean Ϯ SE), whereas the EEN group exhibited significant weight gain (day 3: 8.1 Ϯ 2.7%; day 6: 9.7 Ϯ 2.1%). Mean urinary %L was increased, %R reduced, and L/R recovery ratios increased compared to reference values throughout the study for both groups. Percent lactulose recovery decreased in the EEN group (admission: 22.6 Ϯ 8.0%; day 6: 17.9 Ϯ 2.3%) and increased in the NPO group (admission: 11.0 Ϯ 2.6%; day 6: 22.5 Ϯ 4.6%, P ϭ .035). Fecal ␣ 1 -PI was above reference values in both groups and declined progressively. No significant differences occurred for %R, L/R ratios, or ␣ 1 -PI between groups. Thirteen NPO dogs and all EEN dogs survived (P ϭ .48). The EEN group showed earlier clinical improvement and significant weight gain. The significantly decreased %L in the EEN versus NPO group might reflect improved gut barrier function, which could limit bacterial or endotoxin translocation.
8b478ceff05d4c8dcc2481121eaace20a1b674cd	China has led a rapid global spread around the world. For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lockdowns in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple pharmaceutical interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand. impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London, the UK (non-London) and the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. Findings We estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23 rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65 th day (April 11 th ), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65 th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand. Interpretation: Our results show that taking rolling intervention is probably an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. As large difference of population density and social distancing between London and non-London regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement consistent suppression in London for 100 days and rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would potentially reduce the overall infections and deaths, and delay and reduce peak healthcare demand. All rights reserved.

6768d4f8950eb253b1ede0ca9750fb7c0fbd7e02	Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments are critical for the management of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Like in those illnesses, the lung injury and acute respiratory distress shown in patients are the result of a disruption in the balance of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, associated with the severity of the coronavirus disease, is called the cytokine storm. There is a growing concern regarding how patients on immunosuppressant biologic therapies might be at higher risk of being infected and whether they need to discontinue their treatment preemptively. Clinical data on COVID-19 infected patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis are still scarce. Here, we presented seven cases of this type of patients. The patient infected with COVID-19 on apremilast and the one on apremilast with infected spouse showed the best safety profile and mildest symptoms. One of the secukinumab patients also presented a relatively good outcome. Infliximab patients and the one with serious comorbidities showed the worst outcome. Even though more clinical data are yet needed to draw strong conclusions, apremilast could be a safer alternative for dermatology and rheumatology patients in case of clinically important active infection.
357a008270023e621d758ada372b14e676edb782	The 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza, compounded with seasonal influenza, posed a global challenge. Despite the announcement of post-pandemic period on 10 August 2010 by theWHO, H1N1 (2009) virus would continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years and national health authorities should remain vigilant due to unpredictable behaviour of the virus. Majority of the world population is living in countries with inadequate resources to purchase vaccines and stockpile antiviral drugs. Basic hygienic measures such as wearing face masks and the hygienic practice of hand washing could reduce the spread of the respiratory viruses. However, the imminent issue is translating these measures into day-to-day practice. The experience from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong has shown that general practitioners (GPs) were willing to discharge their duties despite risks of getting infected themselves. SARS event has highlighted the inadequate interface between primary and secondary care and valuable health care resources were thus inappropriately matched to community needs. There are various ways for GPs to contribute in combating the influenza pandemic. They are prompt in detecting and monitoring epidemics and mini-epidemics of viral illnesses in the community. They can empower and raise the health literacy of the community such as advocating personal hygiene and other precautious measures. GPs could also assist in the development of protocols for primary care management of patients with flu-like illnesses and conduct clinical audits on the standards of preventive and treatment measures. GPs with adequate liaison with public health agencies would facilitate early diagnosis of patients with influenza. In this article, we summarise the primary care actions for phases 4-6 of the pandemic. We shall discuss the novel roles of GPs as alternative source of health care for patients who would otherwise be cared for in the secondary care level. The health care system would thus remain sustainable during the public health crisis.
697fe5f70633f7e752f04d10a84dd1a001947cf8	Ethidium monoazide bromide (EMA) treatment of pure culture and environmental waters at low concentrations (1.0-7.5 µg/ml) indicated effective enumeration of viable and viable but nonculturable Escherichia coli in pure cultures, creek waters, and secondary activated sludge effluent samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) amplification of the uidA and fliC gene targets at turbidity values <10 NTU. However, EMA treatment was not effective in primary clarifier and secondary trickling filter effluents where turbidities were ≥10 NTU. In viable pure cultures, rapidly dividing and senescent cells were most affected by increasing EMA concentrations. Amplification of heat-killed pure bacterial cultures decreased 4 to 6 logs depending on EMA concentration and culture age. The greatest difference was observed in 5-h cultures using 7.5 μg/ml EMA. Turbidity (≥100 NTU) in environmental samples inhibited EMA effectiveness on viability discrimination. Enumeration of E. coli in certain wastewaters using EMA-qPCR was similar to culture suggesting that EMA treatment could be incorporated into qPCR assays for the quantification of viable bacteria increasing assay time no more than 30 min. Our results indicate that EMA can be used in routine qPCR assays, but optimum conditions for exposure must be identified for each sample type due to sample matrix effects such as turbidity.
c8bb4de72eb02d40b902f3b47cd7e65ee44e643d	The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a threatening risk for global public health. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 patients of CAP underwent thin-section CT. All images were preprocessed to obtain the segmentations of both infections and lung fields, which were used to extract location-specific features. An infection Size Aware Random Forest method (iSARF) was proposed, in which subjects were automated categorized into groups with different ranges of infected lesion sizes, followed by random forests in each group for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method yielded sensitivity of 0.907, specificity of 0.833, and accuracy of 0.879 under five-fold cross-validation. Large performance margins against comparison methods were achieved especially for the cases with infection size in the medium range, from 0.01% to 10%. The further inclusion of Radiomics features show slightly improvement. It is anticipated that our proposed framework could assist clinical decision making.
c2fcd9c91b07be58e2f41e2df822f132a4e2be94	The COVID-19 pandemic poses two challenges to healthcare providers. Firstly, a high number of patients require hospital admission. Second, a high number of healthcare staff are either falling ill with the infection, or self-isolating. This poses significant problems for the staffing of busy hospital departments. We have created a simple model which allows users to stress test their rota. The model provides plots of staff availability over time using either a constant infection rate, or a changing infection rate fitted to population-based infection curves. It allows users to gauge the extent and timing of dips in staff availability. The basic constant infection rate model is available within an on-line web application (https://covid19.shef.ac.uk). As for any model, our work is imperfect. However, it allows a range of infection rates to be simulated quickly across different work patterns. We hope it will be useful to those planning staff deployment and will stimulate debate on the most effective patterns of work during the COVID-19 epidemic.
ccc017c84707c0c4a8ebb8a20ff866f75f076281	New York City has been at the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic that has already infected over a million people and resulted in more than 70,000 deaths as of early May 2020 in the United States alone. This rapid and enormous influx of patients into the health care system has had profound effects on all aspects of health care, including the care of patients with cancer. In this report, the authors highlight the transformation they underwent within the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology as they prepared for the COVID-19 crisis in New York City. Under stressful and uncertain conditions, some of the many changes they enacted within their division included developing a regular line of communication among division leaders to ensure the development and implementation of a restructuring strategy, completely reconfiguring the inpatient and outpatient units, rapidly developing the ability to perform telemedicine video visits, and creating new COVIDrule-out and COVID-positive clinics for their patients. These changes allowed them to manage the storm while minimizing the disruption of important continuity of care to their patients with cancer. The authors hope that their experiences will be helpful to other oncology practices about to experience their own individual COVID-19 crises.
87813bb82131c365a38b07254a8d32f9b49f42ef	In the global pandemic COVID-19, it is important for everyone including nuclear medicine personnel to know how to stop transmission and contain and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Here, we summarize our American College of Nuclear Medicine members' experiences from Wuhan, China; Singapore; and the USA, so to provide advice to the nuclear medicine personnel for their clinical practice and management strategies in responding to COVID-19.
51678579179185c61f5d66b64b11afccff937858	The unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19 is currently occupying the attention of physicians worldwide. This disease caused by the novel coronavirus, now designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily an upper respiratory tract infection. However, it does impact on all specialties as medical organisations are redirected to fight the infection. The impact of COVID-19 on gastroenterology is multifaceted. Firstly, the effect of virus SARS-CoV-2 is there on the GI tract. 1 Secondly, there is the effect of the highly infectious agent on the ongoing care of GI and liver patients, particularly at endoscopy where close contact with the patient may result in potential contamination. Finally there is the effect of the redirection of healthcare priorities and the negative impact it may have on many important gastroenterology services. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus be-

The present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012-2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems: general practice, emergency general practice, hospital emergency units, intensive care units, and nursing homes. Twenty-eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ILI. Sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses (A(H1N1)pdm2009, A(H3N2) and B) was performed. The trends in ILI/influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios (RIRs) of having an ILI consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed. Of the 182 ILI patients enrolled by general practitioners, 57.7% tested positive for influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses. The ILI/influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated. In accordance with virological data, the RIRs of having an ILI consultation were highest among the young (,15 years old) and decreased with age. No clusters of acute respiratory illness were declared by the sentinel nursing homes. This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012-2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica as monitored through several surveillance systems. To improve ILI surveillance in Corsica, a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ILI systems described here is being implemented.
defec48c714bf474bf4c1b74c6d6128035c5e241	The best therapeutic strategy to find an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is to explore the target structural protein. In the present study, a novel multi-epitope vaccine is designed using in silico tools that potentially trigger both CD4 and CD8 T-cell immune responses against the novel Coronavirus. The vaccine candidate was designed using B and T-cell epitopes that can act as an immunogen and elicits immune response in the host system. NCBI was used for the retrieval of surface spike glycoprotein, of novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) strains. VaxiJen server screens the most important immunogen of all the proteins and IEDB server gives the prediction and analysis of B and T cell epitopes. Final vaccine construct was designed in silico composed of 425 amino acids including the 50S ribosomal protein adjuvant and the construct was computationally validated in terms of antigenicity, allergenicity and stability on considering all critical parameters into consideration. The results subjected to the modeling and docking studies of vaccine were validated. Molecular docking study revealed the protein-protein binding interactions between the vaccine construct and TLR-3 immune receptor. The MD simulations confirmed stability of the binding pose. The immune simulation results showed significant response for immune cells. The findings of the study confirmed that the final vaccine construct of chimeric peptide could able to enhance the immune response against nCoV-19.
ec5726a482dcf29b95f02f724cf9943295429e7d	Covid-19 can induce lung infection ranging from mild pneumonia to life-threatening acute 36 respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Dysregulated host immune response in the lung is a key 37 feature in ARDS pathophysiology. However, cellular actors in Covid-19-driven ARDS are 38 poorly understood. Here, we dynamically analyzed the biology of innate T cells, a 39 heterogeneous class (MAIT, γδT and iNKT cells) of T lymphocytes, presenting potent anti-40 infective and regulatory functions. Patients presented a compartmentalized lung inflammation 41 paralleled with a limited systemic inflammation. Circulating innate T cells of critically ill 42 Covid-19 patients presented a profound and persistent phenotypic and functional alteration. 43 Highly activated innate T cells were detected in airways of patients suggesting a recruitment to 44 the inflamed site and a potential contribution in the regulation of the local inflammation. 45 Finally, the expression of the CD69 activation marker on blood iNKT and MAIT cells at 46 inclusion was predictive of disease severity. Thus, patients present an altered innate T cell 47 biology that may account for the dysregulated immune response observed in Covid-19-related 48 acute respiratory distress syndrome. : medRxiv preprint 69 In December 2019 were first reported in Wuhan, China, pneumonia cases due to a coronavirus, 70 the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel strain related 71 to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, responsible for recent outbreaks. Disease presentation related 72 with SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus disease, Covid-19), can vary from mild disease to life-73 threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is caused by a sustained and 74 dysregulated immune response triggered in the lung after initial insult, resulting in alteration of 75 alveolar-capillary membrane permeability and perturbed tissue repair 1 . This pathological 76 process leads to interstitial and alveolar oedema that profoundly impairs gas exchange. 77 However, the cellular and molecular factors that are responsible for this aberrant and persistent 78 inflammatory response are poorly understood 2 . In SARS-CoV infection, delayed type I IFN 79 response together with high viral loads were associated with defective adaptive response and 80 exaggerated tissue damage 3 . During severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, elevated pro-inflammatory 81 cytokines levels (e.g. IL-6 and TNF-α) were associated with more severe cases, supporting an 82 inflammatory hypothesis 4-6 . In addition, T cell lymphopenia has been correlated with disease 83 severity suggesting a role for these cells in the pathophysiology of severe Covid-19 5,6 . Besides 84 classical adaptative CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, the T cell compartment comprises several lineages 85 of cells endowed with both innate and adaptive properties that are referred to as unconventional 86 or innate T cells (iT cells) 7 . This heterogeneous class of T cells comprises three main lineages 87 including Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT), γδT and invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) 88 cells. They are restricted to quasi-monomorphic non-classical major histocompatibility 89 complex and have emerged as key players in mucosal immunity and inflammatory response 8-90 11 . Given their versatile functions, iT cells emerge as interesting targets in the context of Covid-91 19-driven ARDS. First, iT cells mainly populate mucosal tissues including the lung and have 92 the ability to promptly produce substantial amounts of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ 93 and IL-17A, two key cytokines in anti-infective response at barrier sites. Moreover, iT cells can 94 fine-tune the intensity and flavour of the host immune response shaping the magnitude of the 95 adaptive response. They can also participate in the process of the resolution of inflammation 96 including tissue repair and regeneration 12-14 , a critical step that is highly altered during ARDS. Despite these pivotal functions, the putative contribution of iT cells in the pathophysiological 98 process of ARDS has never been explored. 99
c90fed088bf9f3c74522fc4ff856da716ecca521	Recently, the world has been dealing with a devastating global pandemic coronavirus infection, with more than 12 million infected worldwide and over 300,000 deaths as of May 15th 2020, related to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), characterized by a spherical morphology and identified through next-generation sequencing. Although the respiratory tract is the primary portal of entry of SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal involvement associated with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may also occur. No drug or vaccine has been approved due to the absence of evidence deriving from rigorous clinical trials. Increasing interest has been highlighted on the possible preventative role and adjunct treatment of lactoferrin, glycoprotein of human secretions part of a non-specific defensive system, known to play a crucial role against microbial and viral infections and exerting anti-inflammatory effects on different mucosal surfaces and able to regulate iron metabolism. In this review, analysing lactoferrin properties, we propose designing a clinical trial to evaluate and verify its effect using a dual combination treatment with local, solubilized intranasal spray formulation and oral administration. Lactoferrin could counteract the coronavirus infection and inflammation, acting either as natural barrier of both respiratory and intestinal mucosa or reverting the iron disorders related to the viral colonization.
aae7699e079d2964df8078931cd0f94d4b1423d9	Background: Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) cross-reactivity is believed to play a pivotal role in generating immune responses but the extent and mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity remain largely unknown. Several studies suggest that CTL clones can recognize highly diverse peptides, some sharing no obvious sequence identity. The emerging realization in the field is that T cell receptors (TcR) recognize multiple distinct ligands. Principal Findings: First, we analyzed peptide scans of the HIV epitope SLFNTVATL (SFL9) and found that TCR specificity is position dependent and that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition. Inspired by this, we developed a general model of TCR peptide recognition using amino acid similarity matrices and found that such a model was able to predict the cross-reactivity of a diverse set of CTL epitopes. With this model, we were able to demonstrate that seemingly distinct T cell epitopes, i.e., ones with low sequence identity, are in fact more biochemically similar than expected. Additionally, an analysis of HIV immunogenicity data with our model showed that CTLs have the tendency to respond mostly to peptides that do not resemble self-antigens. Conclusions: T cell cross-reactivity can thus, to an extent greater than earlier appreciated, be explained by amino acid similarity. The results presented in this paper will help resolving some of the long-lasting discussions in the field of T cell cross-reactivity.
3686cc6679e6b69e0ff3187aeb37ab90478236f5	To celebrate the 60th anniversary of SCIENCE CHINA, the second issue of Science China Life Sciences (2010) focuses on immunology, with six articles contributed by immunologists working both in and outside China. The articles review the current position and recent developments in the field of immunology, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family molecules, innate recognition, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), costimulatory molecules, T cells, and humanized mouse models. As early as 1798, the word "vaccination" was coined specifically to describe the injection of smallpox vaccine. In 1880, Louis Pasteur published a paper on Pasteurella septica cholera, heralding the beginning of a new scientific field: Immunology. From then on, Pasteur's germ theory of human infectious disease facilitated the development of various vaccines, leading to a greater understanding of the immune system which, in turn, resulted in the expansion of the field of Immunology. For a century, immunologists around the world have enhanced our understanding of the immune system; from humoral and cellular adaptive immunity to the pattern recognition involved in innate immunity. Alongside great advances due to the expansion of molecular biology over the past decade, Immunology has become a central pillar of the life sciences, developing many branches such as Medical Immunology, Tumor Immunology, Clinical Immunology and Transplantation Immunology. As an integral component of medical science, Immunology plays an important role in deepening the understanding of the pathophysiology of human disease, and also contributes to the development of modern therapeutics to treat infection, autoimmune diseases, allergies and cancer. In recent years, Chinese immunologists have produced many important studies in Immunology. The following reviews provide a brief overview of recent advances in Immunology, highlighting the contributions of leading Chinese immunologists. The first review "TRAF-mediated regulation of immune and inflammatory responses" by Wang et al. [1] focuses on the TRAF family, beginning with a comprehensive introduction to structure and function. Over the past few years, research studies have established a central role of TRAF proteins in inflammation and immunity. The TRAF family plays divergent and non-redundant roles in regulating the many signal transduction pathways involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. These molecules participate in signal transduction by a large number of receptor families, including the TNF receptor family and the Toll-like receptor-interleukin-1 receptor family. The review summarizes the divergent roles played by TRAF proteins in positive and negative regulation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways and type I interferon pathways, and also points out many aspects of TRAF biology that, although not clear, may still be of great significance to related research. The second review is entitled "On self-non-self discrimination in pattern recognition" by Liu et al. [2]. The first section of this article discusses the development of immunity from a historical perspective. The second part deals with two different patterns of innate immune recognition. The third part then goes on to summarize the latest advances in the authors' own research into the CD24-SiglecG/10 pathway. According to their studies, the CD24/Siglec 10 pathway discriminates pathogen-associated molecular patterns
366b6d0b2e9e495191749ab57814cebd64993105	Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child morbidity, especially in developing countries. Viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections. In Senegal, few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available, and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections. Clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old. A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient. These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR or by viral culture. A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n ¼ 5) or 3 (n ¼ 1) viruses. Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n ¼ 25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n ¼ 13), rhinoviruses (n ¼ 8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n ¼ 6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n ¼ 2), and bocavirus (n ¼ 1). These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal. The establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies.
f6525bc180629aca4b0760e0ff9f187f2e2a6fec	Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a newly emerging enteric coronavirus, is considered to be associated with swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) which has caused significantly economic losses to the porcine industry. Interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immune response is unclear yet. In this study, we used IPEC-J2 cells as a model to explore potential evasion strategies employed by SADS-CoV. Our results showed that SADS-CoV infection failed to induce IFN-β production, and inhibited poly (I:C) and Sendai virus (SeV)-triggered IFN-β expression. SADS-CoV also blocked poly (I:C)-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and NF-κB. Furthermore, SADS-CoV did not interfere with the activity of IFN-β promoter stimulated by IRF3, TBK1 and IKKε, but counteracted its activation induced by IPS-1 and RIG-I. Collectively, this study is the first investigation that shows interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immunity, which provides information of the molecular mechanisms underlying SASD-CoV infection.

5bd9a8cbba75c8ee241ee3870d02dbe437b6f60f	Neurotropic coronavirus infection of mice results in acute encephalomyelitis followed by viral persistence. Whereas cellular immunity controls acute infection, humoral immunity regulates central nervous system (CNS) persistence. Maintenance of serum Ab was correlated with tissue distribution of virus-specific Ab-secreting cells (ASC). Although virus-specific ASC declined in cervical lymph node and spleen after infectious virus clearance, virus-specific serum Ab was sustained at steady levels, with a delay in neutralizing Ab. Virus-specific ASC within the CNS peaked rapidly 1 wk after control of infectious virus and were retained throughout chronic infection, consistent with intrathecal Ab synthesis. Surprisingly, frequencies of ASC in the BM remained low and only increased gradually. Nevertheless, virus-specific ASC induced by peripheral infection localized to both spleen and BM. The data suggest that CNS infection provides strong stimuli to recruit ASC into the inflamed tissue through sustained up-regulation of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10. Irrespective of Ag deprivation, CNS retention of ASC coincided with elevated BAFF expression and ongoing differentiation of class II + to class II -CD138 + CD19 + plasmablasts. These results confirm the CNS as a major ASCsupporting environment, even after resolution of viral infection and in the absence of chronic ongoing inflammation.

1191fe05d0db36af1b8920617f79069e8a20d37d	This paper investigates the effect of population health on gross inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). We conduct a panel data analysis of 74 industrialized and developing countries over 1980-2000. Our main finding is that gross inflows of FDI are strongly and positively influenced by population health in low-and middle-income countries. Our estimates suggest that raising life expectancy by one year increases gross FDI inflows by 9%, after controlling for other relevant variables. These findings are consistent with the view that health is an integral component of human capital for developing countries.
57d2f0345fb215ee80b39aedabaa55c45a5a1380	The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is unfolding as a major international crisis whose influence extends to every aspect of our daily lives. Testing is critical in identifying patients and carriers. Effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined, thus reducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to restart the economy safely and securely. The testing capacity will remain a constraint for the foreseeable future compared to the size of the US population. The focus of this paper is to develop highly efficient testing strategies that make optimal use of our testing resources in order to minimize the number of infected individuals. Developing a good testing strategy can be greatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers information about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine whom to test. There have been significant efforts to improve contact tracing by developing apps that leverage the ubiquity of smart phones to automatically detect contacts between individuals within a pre-determined distance from each other (e.g., within 6 feet), the time duration of the contact, etc. Countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus typically use a "test, treat, trace, test" strategy that begins with testing individuals with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via a combinations of patient memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing their contacts, and repeating this procedure. The problem is that such strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources. This is especially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days after the infection (or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many COVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread the virus). Such greedy strategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare up in the future. In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential learning-based resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to the problem is provided by a time-varying social contact graph obtained through various contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient learning strategies that minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based on policy iteration and lookahead rules. We investigate fundamental performance bounds, and ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as well as in the tests themselves.
ccd0d0b49ad2dbbc03fd68c462d2609a7bfa8959	Widespread testing for the presence novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in patients remains vital for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic prior to the advent of an effective treatment. The early testing shortfall in some parts of the US can be traced to an initial shortage of supplies, expertise and/or instrumentation necessary to detect the virus by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Here we show that academic biochemistry and molecular biology laboratories equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure can produce the RT-qPCR assay and backfill pipeline shortages. The Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group synthesized multiplexed primers and probes and formulated a master mix composed of enzymes and proteins produced in-house. We compare the performance of our inhouse kit to a commercial product used for diagnostic testing and describe implementation of environmental testing to monitor surfaces across various campus laboratories for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

The specific feature of the COVID-19 characterized by its long latent period is taken into account. Exponential increase of numbers of infected people is determined by the half period of the maximal latent time for the COVID-19. The averaging over latent period leads to additional increase of the infected numbers. PACS number(s): 02.50.-r, 05.60.-k, 82.39.-k, 87.19.Xx
7dff9ebb8731f6d0be28d5a2ef1710327b46094f	In this paper we study the problem of clustering bacterial isolates into epidemiologically related groups from next-generation sequencing data. Existing methods for this problem mainly use a single genotyping signal, and either use a distance-based method with a pre-specified number of clusters, or a phylogenetic tree-based method with a prespecified threshold. We propose PathOGiST, an algorithmic framework for clustering bacterial isolates by leveraging multiple genotypic signals and calibrated thresholds. PathOGiST uses different genotypic signals, clusters the isolates based on these individual signals with correlation clustering, and combines the clusterings based on the individual signals through consensus clustering. We implemented and tested PathOGiST on three different bacterial pathogens -Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis -and we conclude by discussing further avenues to explore.
dbaaa5a246123fee5013bba144f693f96e624988	In a screen for RNA mutagen resistance, we isolated a high fidelity RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) variant of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3). Curiously, this variant A372V is also resistant to amiloride. We hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity. Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ , which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity. Furthermore, we show that another amiloride-resistant RdRp variant, S299T, is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations. We show that RdRp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms: 1) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower basal mutation frequencies or 2) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations that affect polymerase fidelity. Our results uncover a new antiviral approach based on mutagenesis.

d5bcb5d8c2edd7162e5f0fe6c189662b39eebfbe	Despite high sequence similarity between pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses, there is extreme variation in host pathogenicity from one viral strain to the next. Identifying the underlying mechanisms of variability in pathogenicity is a critical task for understanding influenza virus infection and effective management of highly pathogenic influenza virus disease. We applied a network-based modeling approach to identify critical functions related to influenza virus pathogenicity using large transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from mice infected with six influenza virus strains or mutants. Our analysis revealed two pathogenicity-related gene expression clusters; these results were corroborated by matching proteomics data. We also identified parallel downstream processes that were altered during influenza pathogenesis. We found that network bottlenecks (nodes that bridge different network regions) were highly enriched in pathogenicity-related genes, while network hubs (highly connected network nodes) were significantly depleted in these genes. We confirmed that this trend persisted in a distinct virus: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS). The role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in influenza pathogenesis, one of the bottleneck regulators with corroborating signals across transcript and protein expression data, was tested and validated in additional mouse infection experiments. We demonstrate that EGFR is important during influenza infection, but the role it plays changes for lethal versus non-lethal infections. Our results show that by using association networks, bottleneck genes that lack hub characteristics can be used to predict a gene's involvement in influenza virus pathogenicity. We also demonstrate the utility of employing multiple network approaches for analyzing host response data from viral infections.
0f6091029a2cc8ddd6a5c6ee18de7478b73daab2	Influenza A virus (H1N1), which arose in 2009, constituted the fourth pandemic after the cases of 1918, 1957, and 1968. This new variant was formed by a triple reassortment, with genomic segments from swine, avian, and human influenza origins. The objective of this study was to analyze sequences of hemagglutinin (n=2038) and neuraminidase (n=1273) genes, in order to assess the extent of diversity among circulating 2009-2010 strains, estimate if these genes evolved through positive, negative, or neutral selection models of evolution during the pandemic phase, and analyze the worldwide percentage of detection of important amino acid mutations that could enhance the viral performance, such as transmissibility or resistance to drugs. A continuous surveillance by public health authorities will be critical to monitor the appearance of new influenza variants, especially in animal reservoirs such as swine and birds, in order to prevent the potential animal-human transmission of viruses with pandemic potential.
9f4f9029353504187d404bbc3aaac9cb56acde92	Understanding the causes of infectious disease to facilitate better control requires observational and experimental studies. Often these must be conducted at many scales such as at the molecular, cellular, organism, and population level. Studies need to consider both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the pathogen/host interaction. They also require a combination of study methods covered by disciplines such as pathology, epidemiology, microbiology, and ecology. Therefore, it is important that disciplines work together when designing and conducting studies. Finally, we need to integrate and interpret data across levels and disciplines to better formulate control strategies. This requires another group of specialists with broad crossdisciplinary training in epidemiology and an ability to readily work with others.

2dcddabe840e858d91d04286f71d69c184ec0d88	The coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which first emerged in Wuhan, China and was made known to the World in December 2019 turned into a pandemic causing more than 126,124 deaths worldwide up to April 16th, 2020. It has 79.5% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 and the same strategy for host cell invasion through the ACE-2 surface protein. Since the development of novel drugs is a long-lasting process, researchers look for effective substances among drugs already approved or developed for other purposes. The 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease was compared with the 3D structures of seven proteases, which are drug targets, and docking analysis to the SARS-CoV-2 protease structure of thirty four approved and on-trial protease inhibitors was performed. Increased 3D structural similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, the HCV protease and α-thrombin was found. According to docking analysis the most promising results were found for HCV protease, DPP-4, α-thrombin and coagulation Factor Xa known inhibitors, with several of them exhibiting estimated free binding energy lower than −8.00 kcal/mol and better prediction results than reference compounds. Since some of the compounds are well-tolerated drugs, the promising in silico results may warrant further evaluation for viral anticipation. DPP-4 inhibitors with anti-viral action may be more useful for infected patients with diabetes, while anti-coagulant treatment is proposed in severe SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia. Due to the urgent need for effective drugs to attenuate the disease, and the long-lasting process of novel drug development, researchers are focusing on "drug repositioning". Among the drugs approved or developed for other purposes that have been proposed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and are under clinical trials, most are enzyme inhibitors, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) or the protease of the virus. Among them, favipinavir, ribavirin, remdesivir and galidesivir act as RDRP inhibitors while lopinavir, ritonavir [5,6] and danoprevir are viral protease inhibitors. In addition, drugs aiming to prevent the entrance and formation of the viral particles have been proposed, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine [7] and APN01 [8] . Lopinavir and ritonavir designed and approved for the treatment of AIDS were the first protease inhibitors used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 [5,6]. Both drugs were proposed as promising agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-1 by an in silico study conducted in 2016 which had evaluated the probable activity of several HIV-1 protease inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-1 protease using docking analysis [6] . The in silico results were promising, although coronavirus proteases are cysteine proteases while the HIV-1 protease belongs to the aspartate protease family [6] . Upon release of the first SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure (Mpro) to the Protein Data Bank, on March 2020, several in silico studies have been conducted to find potent protease inhibitors [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The in silico-evaluated compounds were mostly approved drugs of all categories [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , and natural plant [11, 13] as well as marine [16] products. Since docking analysis was performed, in most cases, in randomly selected approved drugs, independently of the rational of their initial design and their initial target, pharmaceutical agents of different drug categories have been proposed. Among the most potent predicted inhibitors were anti-bacterial [10, 19] , anti-fungal [10], anti-viral [12], anti-tuberculosis [12], anti-nimatoid [17], anti-protozoal [17], anti-helminthic [19], anti-inflammatory [19], anti-tumor [10,12], vasodilator [10] vasoprotective [12], anti-convulsant [12], bronchodilator [12], anti-psychotic [10] agents and vitamins [12] . Among the anti-viral agents are ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue used for the treatment of Lassa fever virus, influenza A and B and HCV [12] ; telbivudine, a nucleoside analogue used for the treatment of HAV [12]; the HIV-1 integrase inhibitors raltegravir and dolutegravir [13] and the HIV-1 protease inhibitors, darunavir and saquinavir [14] . According to a more recent in silico research, published on April 15th, the HCV protease inhibitors, simeprevir and faldaprevir as well as the HIV-1 protease inhibitors indinavir and tipranavir along with saquinavir were predicted to act as better Mpro inhibitors compared to the lopinavir and ritonavir used in clinical practice [15] . Danoprevir was the first anti-HCV protease inhibitor which was approved for clinical trials (clinical trial: NCT04291729). Proteases are central enzymes in the biology of humans and viruses, and several of them have become drug targets for anti-viral therapy as well as for the treatment of various diseases. There is a number of approved drugs that act as protease inhibitors [20] . Among the main proteolytic enzymes are the viral proteases of HIV-1, with more than fifteen approved or on-trial drugs, and of HCV, with more than ten drugs. In addition, a number of drugs against human proteases have been developed. Among them are renin inhibitors, with seven compounds and ACE inhibitors, with more than twenty compounds with applications in the treatment of hypertension; thrombin as well as coagulation Factor Xa inhibitors used as anti-thrombotic agents. DPP-4 inhibitors, gliptins, are used for the treatment of type II diabetes, with seventeen drugs of this type mentioned in the WHO drugs stem book [21] . The above proteases belong to different classes according to the catalytic amino acid. While the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a cysteine protease [20, 22] , the HIV-1 enzyme is an aspartate protease [20, 23] . The human drug target renin also belongs to this family. On the other hand, the HCV protease [24] as well as the human protease , the coagulation Factor Xa [26] and thrombin [27] are serine proteases, while the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) belongs to the metalloproteinase family [20, 28] .
e1448d80b4a4b1797167499f539694e158ee1331	Computational docking approaches aim to overcome the limited availability of experimental structural data on protein-protein interactions, which are key in biology. The field is rapidly moving from the traditional docking methodologies for modeling of binary complexes to more integrative approaches using templatebased, data-driven modeling of multi-molecular assemblies. We will review here the predictive capabilities of current docking methods in blind conditions, based on the results from the most recent community-wide blind experiments. Integration of template-based and ab initio docking approaches is emerging as the optimal strategy for modeling protein complexes and multimolecular assemblies. We will also review the new methodological advances on ab initio docking and integrative modeling. Protein-protein interactions are key for the majority of biological functions. Proteins can form highly specific transient or permanent complexes that range from binary pairs to multi-molecular assemblies, often involving other biomolecules. A detailed structural knowledge of such complexes at atomic level would improve our understanding of biological processes and facilitate intervention for biomedical and biotechnological purposes. For example, recently reported structural data on the dynamic assembly formed by the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and the cell receptor ACE2 are key to understand the molecular mechanisms of the virus infectivity and can be essential for the development of new vaccines and therapeutic candidates against 2 , 3] . However, structural data is available for only a small fraction of the protein interactome. For instance, the total number of protein-protein interactions in human is estimated to range from 130 000 [4] to 650 000 [5], but less than 7000 of these interactions have available 3D structure (Interactome3D, 2019_1 version) [6] . In this context, computational docking approaches aim to overcome the limited availability of experimental structural data. Since the first reported protein-protein docking algorithms in the early 90's, based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) sampling [7], the methodological developments have mostly focused on ab initio docking of binary complexes, starting from the structure of the unbound components. Some of the most popular methods are FTDock [8], ZDOCK [9] or MolFit [10]. The method HEX [11] and later FRODOCK [12] used polar Fourier correlations to accelerate docking calculations. Other different approaches using stochastic search based on globalenergy optimization are ICM-DISCO [13,14], Rosetta-Dock [15], HADDOCK [16], or SwarmDock [17]. With the increasing availability of complex structures, in recent years attention is focused on template-based structural modeling of complexes, based the standard principles of homology-based modeling. The term template-based docking (as opposed to ab initio docking) is specifically used when a model is built by superimposing the structures (or models) of the unbound subunits onto the corresponding subunits of a template complex structure [18]. One advantage is that template-based modeling can be applied to multi-molecular complexes, not just to binary complexes as ab initio docking. In addition, it has been suggested that templates are available for the large majority of cases in which interacting subunits have structural information [19]. However, the general availability of good-quality templates that could be reliable used for template-based predictions seems much lower [20 ]. Actually, for the majority of known interactions, only templates with remote homology are available [4], for which direct application of template-based methods leads to poor predictions [21]. Modeling multi-molecular assemblies implies additional challenges. For instance, some of the interfaces might not have available templates, in which case, we could model them by ab initio docking, in combination with restraints from evolutionary data or from available experimental information. Another challenge is to identify the relevant oligomerization state of the assembly when is different from that in the template [22], in which case, alternative orientations provided by ab initio docking can be very helpful. Modeling the conformational variability of the assembly components imposes an additional difficulty. Indeed, directly taking the structure of a given subunit in another context (e.g. unbound state, different assembly or alternative oligomerization state) might lead to inaccurate models. For this, it can be useful the application of protein-protein docking and associated procedures, such as energy scoring, minimization, or flexible refinement. We will review here the predictive capabilities of current protein-protein docking methods in blind conditions, based on the results from the most recent CASP [23 ] and CAPRI [24 ] experiments. These tests show that combination of template-based and ab initio docking approaches is emerging as the optimal strategy for modeling protein complexes and multimolecular assemblies. We will also review the most recent methodological novelties on ab initio docking, and new approaches for the inclusion of experimental information and integrative modeling. Predictive capabilities of computational docking: the state-of-the-art Ab initio computational docking can provide acceptable models within the top 10 predictions in up to 40% of the cases, according to reported evaluation studies of different methodologies in current protein-protein docking benchmark version 5.0 [20 ,25,26]. Traditionally CASP has been focused on the prediction of the structure of individual proteins. However, very often proteins are found as oligomeric assemblies, which adds complexity to the modeling effort. To evaluate the applicability of docking methodologies for the prediction of protein oligomeric assemblies, the last three CASP editions included a CASP-CAPRI joint experiment focused on multimeric assemblies, which are independently evaluated by CASP and CAPRI communities. The recent CASP13-CAPRI challenge comprised a total of 20 protein oligomeric assemblies, including 14 homocomplexes and 6 hetero-complexes, which could be classified into 15 dimers and 5 multimeric assemblies [23 ]. In the 9 'easy' targets, there were good structural templates for the (partial or full) assembly, while for some of the remaining 11 'difficult' targets, it was possible to find remote templates for part of the assembly. The availability of templates in each case is critical to explain the predictive success of the groups. Focusing on the results for the top 10 predictions (to facilitate comparison with the reported performances of different docking methods in the literature), the best-performing group submitted acceptable (or better) models for 13 targets (65% of the cases) (Figure 1 ). In the 'easy' targets, the best-performing group submitted acceptable models for all these cases, while in the 'difficult' targets, the best-performing group submitted acceptable models for only 4 of such targets (36% of the cases). Regarding the quality of the models, high-quality models [23 ] were submitted by any group in 78% of the 'easy' targets (with template), but only in 9% of the 'difficult' targets (no template). On the other side, the recent 7th CAPRI edition showed more heterogeneity in its targets, comprising 8 proteinprotein, 3 protein-peptide, and 5 protein-oligosaccharide complexes, all hetero-oligomers (except for a homodecamer), which could be classified in 10 dimers and 6 multimeric assemblies [24 ]. The actual number of evaluated targets was 19, because some of the interfaces in these multimeric assemblies were considered as independent targets. There were structural templates for a total of 13 target interfaces (6 protein-protein, 2 protein-peptide, and 5 protein-saccharide). This was determinant for the overall predictive success of the groups as well as for the quality of the predicted models. Overall, the maximum number of target interfaces successfully predicted by a single group was 13 (i.e. success in 68% of the cases) (Figure 1 ). But in cases with no available template, the best-performing groups submitted acceptable models for only 2 target interfaces (i.e. success in 33% of the cases). Regarding the quality of the models, high-quality models [24 ] were submitted by any group in 31% of the 'easy' targets (with template) and in 17% of the 'difficult' targets (no template). The 7th CAPRI edition showed that ab initio docking in cases for which there is no available template is still highly challenging, and progress is actually coming from the efficient procedures to combine template-based modeling and other docking methodologies. The CASP and CAPRI experiments show that templatebased modeling approaches are clearly the tools of choice when one can use templates of sufficient quality. However, very often only remote templates are available, which might not be good enough to provide reliable models, as above discussed [21]. In unclear situations, a relevant question is which method to choose, or how to efficiently combine these protein-protein docking approaches depending on each specific case [20 ]. This is even more relevant when modeling multimeric complexes, in which some interfaces might be modelled based on homologous structures, while others would need ab initio docking, as above mentioned. An updated version of the InterEvDock2 server [27 ] can perform template-based docking or ab initio docking with evolutionary constraints, depending on the case. But the question is still open about how to efficiently combine template-based and ab initio docking when reliability of the template is unclear. We can obtain some hints from the recent CASP and CAPRI experiments. 60 Biophysical and computational methods Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2020, 64:59-65 www.sciencedirect.com In the recent CASP13-CAPRI joint assembly prediction experiment, one of the most efficient approaches was that of Fernández-Recio, based on a combination of templatebased and ab initio docking followed by pyDock scoring [23 ], which ranked 2nd and 1st among all the CAPRI predictors and scorers groups, respectively. Models for the subunits were built by CASP-hosted servers. Then, ab initio docking was applied in all cases, using appropriate symmetry constraints or interface restraints from literature. Additionally, when reliable templates were found, template-based models were built by superimposing all possible models of the monomers onto them. After sorting all built models by pyDock scoring, the proportion of template-based and ab initio docking models in the final set of submitted models depended on the reliability of the templates (Figure 2 ). The difference with other methodologies was more evident on the 'difficult' cases for which no clear template was available. For instance, in T154 ab initio docking by pyDock produced the only acceptable models among all participants. In T157, pyDock also produced some of the few successful models of all groups. For scorers, pyDock was used to evaluate all the proposed models, and in case of reliable templates, consistency between energy-based scoring and template-based data was sought. In 7th CAPRI, predictions using template information were in general successful. Indeed, failing to use available templates, as Fernández-Recio did in T122, T125 interface 1/4, and T133 targets, led to much worse predictions (although interestingly, this group was successful in the latter target, using only ab initio docking). This shows that it is critical to choose the optimal docking approach for each case, depending on the template availability. In the rest of targets, templates were used indirectly. In the two protein-peptide targets with good templates (T134, T135), ab initio docking with pyDock with restraints from the available templates was successful. In the six proteinsaccharide targets (T126-130), ab initio docking on the cavity identified from the available templates was also successful. These represent alternative strategies to combine ab initio docking with template information. Computational approaches to docking Rosell and Ferná ndez-Recio 61 Figure 1

edb6c82007b0ae485698434032ead89735e131a8	Pacemaker implantation is considered as a standard procedure for treatment of symptomatic bradycardia in both dogs and cats. Advanced second-degree and third-degree atrioventricular blocks, sick sinus syndrome, persistent atrial standstill, and vasovagal syncope are the most common rhythm disturbances that require pacing to either alleviate clinical signs or prolong survival. Most pacemakers are implanted transvenously, using endocardial leads, but rarely epicardial leads may be necessary. To decide whether a patient is a candidate for pacing, as well as which pacing modality should be used, the clinician must have a clear understanding of the etiology, the pathophysiology, and the natural history of the most common bradyarrhythmias, as well as what result can be achieved by pacing patients with different rhythm disturbances. The goal of this review was, therefore, to describe the indications for pacing by evaluating the available evidence in both human and veterinary medicine. We described the etiology of bradyarrhythmias, clinical signs and electrocardiographic abnormalities, and the choice of pacing modality, taking into account how different choices may have different physiological consequences to selected patients. It is expected that this review will assist veterinarians in recognizing arrhythmias that may require permanent pacing and the risk-benefit of each pacing modality and its impact on outcome. ª

Because of different treatment options for the parasites, confirmation of presence of one or both pathogens is necessary. The PCR based assays are suitable for differential diagnosis. We evaluated the performance of Small Animal Diarrhoea panel, a multiplexed-tandem real-time PCR (MT-PCR) assay, that detects DNA of both G. intestinalis and T. foetus. The sensitivity and specificity were compared to reference real-time PCR assays using 105 faecal samples, 39.05% (n = 41) positive for G. intestinalis and 30.48% (n = 32) were positive for T. foetus. The faecal samples positive for T. foetus had a high proportion of late amplifiers, determined by an arbitrary threshold of C t -values > 35. On the other hand, only one G. intestinalis positive sample was considered a late amplifier. For G. intestinalis DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 95.1% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity. For T. foetus DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 41.9% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity. To evaluate the interlaboratory reproducibility of the MT-PCR assay, results were compared in two different laboratories and found to be in a very good agreement (Kappa = 0.9). Further analysis of the DNA using conventional PCR determined presence of G. intestinalis Assemblage F and T. foetus genotype 'feline'. In conclusion, the MT-PCR Small Animal Diarrhoea panel had a good and poor performance against reference assays for G. intestinalis and T. foetus, respectively. The assay is suitable for detection and differential diagnosis of G. intestinalis and moderate to high burdens of T. foetus in small animal clinical practice.
5b13e81ee4495ff3eccaeea21f955ebc5e5cbde1	The main objective of this study is to apply autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to make real-time predictions on the number of beds occupied in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, during the recent SARS outbreak. Methods: This is a retrospective study design. Hospital admission and occupancy data for isolation beds was collected from Tan Tock Seng hospital for the period 14 th March 2003 to 31 st May 2003. The main outcome measure was daily number of isolation beds occupied by SARS patients. Among the covariates considered were daily number of people screened, daily number of people admitted (including observation, suspect and probable cases) and days from the most recent significant event discovery. We utilized the following strategy for the analysis. Firstly, we split the outbreak data into two. Data from 14 th March to 21 st April 2003 was used for model development. We used structural ARIMA models in an attempt to model the number of beds occupied. Estimation is via the maximum likelihood method using the Kalman filter. For the ARIMA model parameters, we considered the simplest parsimonious lowest order model. We found that the ARIMA (1,0,3) model was able to describe and predict the number of beds occupied during the SARS outbreak well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the training set and validation set were 5.7% and 8.6% respectively, which we found was reasonable for use in the hospital setting. Furthermore, the model also provided three-day forecasts of the number of beds required. Total number of admissions and probable cases admitted on the previous day were also found to be independent prognostic factors of bed occupancy. Conclusion: ARIMA models provide useful tools for administrators and clinicians in planning for real-time bed capacity during an outbreak of an infectious disease such as SARS. The model could well be used in planning for bed-capacity during outbreaks of other infectious diseases as well.

7c143e4d83d1094cda344d4491592ccae5ee6de9	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by progressive airfl ow obstruction that is only partly reversible, infl ammation in the airways, and systemic eff ects or comorbities. The main cause is smoking tobacco, but other factors have been identifi ed. Several pathobiological processes interact on a complex background of genetic determinants, lung growth, and environmental stimuli. The disease is further aggravated by exacerbations, particularly in patients with severe disease, up to 78% of which are due to bacterial infections, viral infections, or both. Comorbidities include ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and lung cancer. Bronchodilators constitute the mainstay of treatment: β 2 agonists and long-acting anticholinergic agents are frequently used (the former often with inhaled corticosteroids). Besides improving symptoms, these treatments are also thought to lead to some degree of disease modifi cation. Future research should be directed towards the development of agents that notably aff ect the course of disease. We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase for papers published in 2006-10. We used the terms "COPD-Epidemiology and causes", "COPD-Pathophysiology", "COPD-Exacerbations", "COPD-Systemic manifestations", "COPD-Co-morbidities", "COPD-Clinical management", and "COPD-Specifi c drug classes". We also searched the reference lists of identifi ed articles for further relevant papers, and we included older widely referenced publications.

85b5447948b449ab1c2e90e5a165e62c5df853bc	Since the re-emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2014, comprehensive and stringent interventions have been implemented to decelerate the spread of the disease. The effectiveness of interventions still remains unclear. In this paper, we develop an epidemiological model that includes various controlling measures to systematically evaluate their effects on the disease transmission dynamics. By fitting the model to reported cumulative cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia until March 22, 2015, we estimate the basic reproduction number in these countries as 1.2552, 1.6093 and 1.7994, respectively. Model analysis shows that there exists a threshold of the effectiveness of isolation, below which increasing the fraction of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset or shortening the duration between symptoms onset and isolation may lead to more Ebola infection. This challenges an existing view. Media coverage plays a substantial role in reducing the final epidemic size. The response to reported cumulative infected cases and deaths may have a different effect on the epidemic spread in different countries. Among all the interventions, we find that shortening the duration between death and burial and improving the effectiveness of isolation are two effective interventions for controlling the outbreak of Ebola virus infection.
3e99ce5f25b80ad020764319fe592ef4a772c48b	The prion protein, PrP, can adopt at least 2 conformations, the overwhelmingly prevalent cellular conformation (PrP C ) and the scrapie conformation (PrP Sc ). PrP C features a globular C-terminal domain containing 3 α-helices and a short β-sheet and a long flexible N-terminal tail whose exact conformation in vivo is not yet known and a metastable subdomain with βstrand propensity has been identified within it. The PrP Sc conformation is very rare and has the characteristics of an amyloid. Furthermore, PrP Sc is a prion, i.e., it is infectious. This involves 2 steps: (1) PrP Sc can template PrP C and coerce it to adopt the PrP Sc conformation and (2) PrP Sc can be transmitted between individuals, by oral, parenteral, and other routes and thus propagate as an infectious agent. However, this is a simplification: On the one hand, PrP Sc is not a single conformation, but rather, a set of alternative similar but distinct conformations. Furthermore, other amyloid conformations of PrP exist with different biochemical and propagative properties. In this issue of PLOS Biology, Asante and colleagues describe the first murine model of familial human prion disease and demonstrate the emergence and propagation of 2 PrP amyloid conformers. Of these, one causes neurodegeneration, whereas the other does not. With its many conformers, PrP is a truly protean protein.
c910e9d04281f2009e2c79132dfa5691442ff86d	Dear Readers, "The ball is round, and a game lasts 90 minutes." (Sepp Herberger). And we know what to do. We have no choice. We throw everything forward. Every woman, every man. Even if we are acting defensively and time is running out. We go all in -we almost completely blow our cover. We know what to do: nearly anything -really anything. "The round thing has to go into the square thing." (Sepp Herberger). It's that simple. With this clarity, concentration and stormy composure, thousands of scientists, health and nursing professionals, doctors and members of many other healthcare professions are currently working -no fighting the battle against a much smaller opponent -a tiny one: the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV [1], which cannot even be stopped by the tight netting of a mouth and nose protector, let alone a football net. Faced with the current situation, it is simply unthinkable to write a medical text without making a reference to this pandemic. Too much suffering, too many exhausted helpers, too many overwhelming experiences. 375,498 confirmed cases and 16,362 deaths in 195 countries and territories have been recorded according to the latest WHO statistics (as of 25.03.2020; [https://experience. arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee 1b9125cd]. In Wuhan, people are cautiously hesitant to leave their shelters again, while in other places they are waiting in fear -with reports from Spain and Italy breathing down their necks -for the first offshoots of the great wave of sick and respirator-dependent people. We are all preparing ourselves -bracing ourselves for the unknown. We have one of the best healthcare systems. We are well educated. Without wanting to overtax the power of association: This issue, too, reflects part of a mosaic of many thousands of individual conceptual and scientific achievements which, taken together, will help us to overcome -and I am sure we will overcome -this current crisis. The scope of this issue ranges from interactive learning methods for improved knowledge acquisition in microscopic anatomy [2], the contribution of international mobility to medical professionalization [3] and the evaluation of interprofessional attitudes [4], to the illumination of the long-term evaluation of the medical didactic qualification within the framework of the Master of Medical Education (MME; [5]), the optimization of the evaluation of clinicalpractical trials [6], the strengthening of outpatient care through the curricular implementation of learning content [7], programs to strengthen rural care [8], and train-thetrainer programs for the qualification of continuing education officers in general practice [9]. It is precisely these didacticians, teachers, scientists and authors who are making their contribution so that we do not find ourselves powerless in the face of a crisis. Yes, they are. As if that were not enough, I am putting you through even more today. Because at the moment, in view of the many deaths caused by the corona crisis, all the stress on the helpers and the social insecurity in society, it is hard to name and believe: the corona crisis will be far eclipsed by another crisis: the climate crisis. The Lancet Countdown on health and climate change [10] has made this very clear: the health of society in future and the generations to come depends entirely on how we deal with climate change today. According to the latest study by the World Bank, 140 million climate refugees [11] will be added to the 70 million refugees currently in the world by 2050 -combined with enormous despair and suffering [12]. By the end of the current century, depending on the type of cereal, we will have seen harvests decline by up to 19% [13] and will be faced with the question of how to feed the 7.7 billion people currently 1/6
724a7d177a40c86c6f77e8983c1a65e518d306de	The potential of DNA microarrays for detection of plant viruses is hampered by underutilization of sequence-independent amplification methods for target nucleic acid enrichment. A microarray system is described for an unbiased detection of plant viruses using both short (30 nt) and long (50 and 70 nt) oligonucleotide probes. The assay involves amplification of target nucleic acid using random primers followed by in vitro transcription whose cRNA product is labeled chemically, fragmented and used as target for hybridization. Initial optimization tests with Turnip vein clearing virus and Cauliflower mosaic virus showed increased hybridization efficiency with shorter cDNA targets (100 bp) and longer probes (50 and 70 nt). The system was validated in pure and mixed samples by detection of three Tymovirus species: Asclepias asymptomatic virus, Kennedya yellow mosaic virus and Turnip yellow mosaic virus. The method could detect sequence variants with 70-75% or higher sequence identity, indicating the possible utility of the approach for virus discovery. Array performance comparison of long probes demonstrated the competence of 50-mers to provide a satisfactory balance between detection sensitivity and specificity. The work described is a significant step towards a method to assess, in one assay, the presence of a large diversity of relatives of known viruses of plants.
986a3b759ee133ad544b92b6de91647414d55132	Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections in all age groups and in all geographical area. The role of hMPV in causing respiratory tract infections in Kuwait was not yet investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait among patients with respiratory tract infection with respect to other respiratory viruses. During January-December 2009, 460 respiratory samples from 388 patients with respiratory tract infection were collected from different hospitals. They were tested for hMPV RNA by real-time PCR, and for other respiratory viruses by conventional PCR. Out of 388 patients, 110 (28%) were positive for viral respiratory infections; 21 (5.4%) were positive for hMPV, 29 (7.5%) were positive for rhinovirus, 13 (4%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus, and 10 (3%) were positive for adenovirus. Most (n ¼ 19, 90.5%) of hMPV-positive patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 76% of them were of age 2 years and below, and 24% of age 59 years and above. All hMPV-positive elderly patients had pneumonia while 50% of hMPV-positive infants had bronchopneumonia. Children with hMPV/rhinovirus co-infection (n ¼ 3, 1%) had recurrent chest infection and frequent intensive care unit admission. The hMPV infection was mostly detected between December and May, and genotype B was more prevalent than genotype A. This is the first study demonstrating the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait, and suggests that hMPV infection is prevalent in infants and elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infection.
d8b182c5528c93100f975d2d01bec9b1824e5d75	Phenobarbital is the drug of choice for control of canine epilepsy. Phenobarbital induces hepatic enzyme activity, can be hepatotoxic, and decreases serum thyroxine (T 4 ) concentrations in some dogs. The duration of liver enzyme induction and T 4 concentration decreases after discontinuation of phenobarbital is unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the changes in serum total T 4 (TT 4 ), free T 4 (FT 4 ), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cholesterol and albumin concentrations, and activities in serum of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) after discontinuation of long-term phenobarbital administration in normal dogs. Twelve normal dogs were administered phenobarbital at a dosage of approximately 4.4-6.6 mg/kg PO q12h for 27 weeks. Blood was collected for analysis before and after 27 weeks of phenobarbital administration and then weekly for 10 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. The dogs were clinically normal throughout the study period. Serum ALT and ALP activity and TSH and cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher than baseline at week 27. Serum T 4 and FT 4 were significantly lower. Serum albumin and GGT were not changed from baseline at week 27. Changes in estimate of thyroid function (TT 4 , FT 4 , TSH) persisted for 1-4 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital, whereas changes in hepatic enzyme activity (ALT, ALP) and cholesterol concentration resolved in 3-5 weeks. To avoid false positive results, it is recommended that thyroid testing be performed at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital administration. Elevated serum activity of hepatic enzymes 6-8 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital may indicate hepatic disease.
1fe3f895e38e337398e1ab4c612339d3b8e72c90	Targeted recombination was carried out to select mouse hepatitis viruses (MHVs) in a defined genetic background, containing an MHV-JHM spike gene encoding either three heptad repeat 1 (HR1) substitutions (Q1067H, Q1094H, and L1114R) or L1114R alone. The recombinant virus, which expresses spike with the three substitutions, was nonfusogenic at neutral pH. Its replication was significantly inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, and it was highly neuroattenuated in vivo. In contrast, the recombinant expressing spike with L1114R alone mediated cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH and replicated efficiently despite the presence of lysosomotropic agents; however, it still caused only subclinical morbidity and no mortality in animals. Thus, both recombinant viruses were highly attenuated and expressed viral antigen which was restricted to the olfactory bulbs and was markedly absent from other regions of the brains at 5 days postinfection. These data demonstrate that amino acid substitutions, in particular L1114R, within HR1 of the JHM spike reduced the ability of MHV to spread in the central nervous system. Furthermore, the requirements for low pH for fusion and viral entry are not prerequisites for the highly attenuated phenotype.
357ecba25af78078e54800e90def3223f93d162b	An important effort has been performed after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 to diagnose and prevent virus spreading. Several types of vaccines have been developed including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics. This review describes several aspects essential to develop SARS-CoV vaccines, such as the correlates of protection, virus serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the SARS-CoV genome. The production of effective and safe vaccines to prevent SARS has led to the development of promising vaccine candidates, in contrast to the design of vaccines for other coronaviruses, that in general has been less successful. After preclinical trials in animal models, efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humans.
4af14ce29f55afc037b9050c374fd274f0c870bc	Background The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest public health crisis of the last 100 years. Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socio-economic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing among the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app take-up, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. : medRxiv preprint Results We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all sub-groups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We investigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate take-up and found that concerns about cyber security and privacy, together with lack of trust in government, are the main barriers to adoption. Conclusions Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact-tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if take-up is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19. : medRxiv preprint about willingness to install if current restrictions were lifted in response to an "all clear" message.
d3b7f8ab557fea0fa84ef72fbc972dbf0f14dacd	Partial genome characterisation of a non-cultivable marsupial adenovirus is described. Adenovirus-like particles were found by electron microscopy (EM) in the intestinal contents of brushtail possums (Trichosurus 6ulpecula) in New Zealand. Using degenerate PCR primers complementary to the most conserved genome regions of adenoviruses, the complete nucleotide sequence of the penton base gene, and partial nucleotide sequences of the DNA polymerase, hexon, and pVII genes were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the penton base gene strongly suggested that the brushtail possum adenovirus (candidate PoAdV-1) belongs to the recently proposed genus Atadeno6irus. Sequence analysis of the PCR products amplified from the intestinal contents of brushtail possums originating from different geographical regions of New Zealand identified a single genotype. This is the first report of molecular confirmation of an adenovirus in a marsupial.
e9304fa14f5ca2e5589a0354f83cda4a172463c2	Transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) play a key role in the synthesis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) subgenomic mRNAs, which resembles similarity-assisted RNA recombination. In this study, genome instability was found when a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain was inserted by an additional transcription unit in which a foreign gene GFP was expressed from TRS2 while a copy of TRS6 drove ORF2a/b transcription. Structural protein gene-deleted genomes resulted from enhanced RNA recombinations were identified in the recombinant virus rHV-GFP. Moreover, rHV-GFP replicated slower than parental viruses, and caused less cell death in porcine alveolar macrophages. Pigs infected with rHV-GFP survived with no or mild syndromes, whereas all pigs infected with parental viruses died within 12 days. Our data showed that additional transcription unit insertion could confer genome instability and attenuation of HP-PRRSV.
aae5bffb68d7cdbfa23226b018d77627b15c149e	Fifty-one cats histopathologically confirmed to have been naturally infected by feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), were collected to analyse the clinical and laboratory findings and to characterise disease staging. Effusive FIP was found in 33 cats, non-effusive FIP in 12 cats, and mixed-type in six cats. Highly significant decreases in haematocrit and albumin levels and an increase in total bilirubin level were noted in both effusive and non-effusive FIP, at first presentation and before death. In serial blood examinations of the effusive group, anaemia and increases in bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were observed from 2 weeks to 0e3 days before death. The packed cell volume, bilirubin, AST, potassium, and sodium levels were established to predict disease staging and survival time. Cumulative points ranging from 0 to 4, 5 to 11 and excess of 12, indicate that the cat can survive for at least 2 weeks, less than 2 weeks and less than 3 days, respectively.
604491e627b3cb8661ee7f8747623eb4c61f0315	Kazakhstan and the United States have partnered since 2003 to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The US Department of Defense (US DoD) has funded threat reduction programs to eliminate biological weapons, secure material in repositories that could be targeted for theft, and enhance surveillance systems to monitor infectious disease outbreaks that would affect national security. The cooperative biological research (CBR) program of the US DoD's Biological Threat Reduction Program has provided financing, mentorship, infrastructure, and biologic research support to Kazakhstani scientists and research institutes since 2005. The objective of this paper is to provide a historical perspective for the CBR involvement in Kazakhstan, including project chronology, successes and challenges to allow lessons learned to be applied to future CBR endeavors. A project compendium from open source data and interviews with partner country Kazakhstani participants, project collaborators, and stakeholders was developed utilizing studies from 2004 to the present. An earlier project map was used as a basis to determine project linkages and continuations during the evolution of the CBR program. It was determined that consistent and effective networking increases the chances to collaborate especially for competitive funding opportunities. Overall, the CBR program has increased scientific capabilities in Kazakhstan while reducing their risk of biological threats. However, there is still need for increased scientific transparency and an overall strategy to develop a capability-based model to better enhance and sustain future research. Finally, we offer a living perspective that can be applied to further link related studies especially those related to One Health and zoonoses and the assessment of similar capability-building programs.

9ef0f6ed68926afd1ae205195b51205a24266bb5	Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are difficult to diagnose emergencies. Plasma soluble ST2 (sST2), a prognostic biomarker for heart failure, has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker of AASs outperforming D-dimer, the current diagnostic standard. We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of sST2 for AASs in the Emergency Department (ED). In 2017-2018, patients were enrolled if they had ≥1 red-flag symptoms (chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit) and a clinical suspicion of AAS. sST2 was detected with the Presage ® assay. Adjudication was based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) or on diagnostic outcome inclusive of 30-day follow-up. 297 patients were enrolled, including 88 with AASs. The median age was 67 years. In 162 patients with CTA, the median sST2 level was 41.7 ng/mL (IQR 29.4-103.2) in AASs and 34.6 ng/mL (IQR 21.4-51.5) in alternative diagnoses (P = 0.005). In ROC analysis, the AUC of sST2 was 0.63, as compared to 0.82 of D-dimer (P < 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity values of sST2 associated with different cutoffs were: 95.5% and 10.8% (≥12 ng/mL), 84.1% and 29.7% (≥23.7 ng/mL), 35.2% and 85.1% (≥66.5 ng/mL). Results were similar in the full cohort. In conclusion, in patients from a European ED, plasma sST2 provided modest accuracy for diagnosis of AASs. Acute aortic syndromes (AASs), which include acute aortic dissection (AAD), intramural aortic hematoma (IMH), penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) and spontaneous aortic rupture (SAR), are severe cardiovascular emergencies affecting 5-10 per 100.000 individuals a year 1 . A conclusive diagnosis of AASs requires advanced aortic imaging, typically computed tomography angiography (CTA), which uses ionizing radiations and may cause contrast-induced nephropathy and anaphylaxis. However, selection of the right patient to image with CTA is cumbersome, because AASs present with unspecific symptoms such as truncal pain, syncope, neurological deficits and hindlimb ischemia. These are leading causes of Emergency Department (ED) visits worldwide, and most patients with these symptoms are affected by more common conditions, such as acute coronary syndromes, gastrointestinal diseases and muscle-skeletal pain. Hence, the misdiagnosis rate of AASs is high, affecting clinical outcomes 2-4 . Increasing use of CTA in EDs has led to a high number of CTA exams requested for suspected AAS turning out negative, but has not substantially changed misdiagnosis rates, indicating that pre-test patient selection remains a key node 5-7 . Development of reliable diagnostic biomarkers discriminating AASs could positively impact on their diagnostic workup, as for other cardiovascular emergencies such as acute coronary syndromes and pulmonary embolism 8, 9 . So far, potential biomarkers of AASs have been searched for within aortic layers (e.g. smooth muscle myosin, soluble elastin fragments, calponin, CD40 ligand), within inflammation/remodeling pathways (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases) and within coagulation processes mobilized by blood exposure to non-endothelial surfaces (e.g. platelets, D-dimer) 10 . Currently, D-dimer is the only biomarker clinically applicable to the workup of AASs 11,12 . Owing to high sensitivity, D-dimer can be used for diagnostic rule-out of AASs, if the pre-test probability is sufficiently low 13 . However, D-dimer can be increased by several conditions such as inflammation, infection, cancer, trauma and age, leading to low diagnostic specificity. On these grounds, the quest for additional diagnostic biomarkers for AASs remains open and vibrant. ST2 (suppression of tumorigenicity 2, encoded by interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 or IL1RL-1) is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, regulating immune-responses 14 . Soluble ST2 (sST2), a truncated form
78b0fc1f4a496b5f1f7b8b55900b6a0fb2450628	A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. The outbreak affected 90-95% of approximately 200 residents between 20 February 2020 and 31 March 2020. Lay health workers, consisting of trained local volunteers, without healthcare facilities and limited medication options reached out for help online and managed with what they had available. Their experience is relevant to others in similar settings. This report describes the village, outbreak, timeline, symptoms and treatments, and outcomes.

538da7be2912819fdff34d89d51560ae452ecc54	Coronavirus MHV-JHM infections of rats provide useful models to study the pathogenesis of virus-induced central nervous system disease. To analyze the role of the immune response against defined MHV-JHM antigens, we tested the protective efficacy of vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants expressing either the nucleocapsid (N) or the spike (S) protein. A strong protection was mediated in animals by immunization with recombinant VV encoding a wild-type S protein (VV-Swildtype), whereas VV recombinant expressing a mutant S 3 5 4~~ protein (VV-S354~~) had no protective effect. Recombinant VV encoding N protein (VV-N) induces a humoral and a CD4+ Tcell response, but did not prevent acute disease regardless of the immunization protocol. In these experiments, challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of MHV-JHM was performed prior to the induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies and studies with the anti-CD8+ monoclonal antibody, MRC OX8 showed that elimination of the CD8+ subset of Tcells abrogates the protective effect. This result indicates that CD8+ Tcells primed by recombinant VV expressing wild-type S protein are a primary mechanism of immunological defense against MHV-JHM infection in rats.
2e23491f920b7143e67dfa8d4445e4878fe0c664	MERS-CoV is an airborne disease which spreads easily and has high death rate. To predict and prevent MERS-CoV, real-time analysis of user's health data and his/her geographic location are fundamental. Development of healthcare systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution having benefits of better quality of service, reduced cost, scalability, and flexibility. In this paper, an effective cloud computing system is proposed which predicts MERS-CoV-infected patients using Bayesian belief network and provides geographic-based risk assessment to control its outbreak. The proposed system is tested on synthetic data generated for 0.2 million users. System provided high accuracy for classification and appropriate geographicbased risk assessment. The key point of this paper is the use of geographic positioning system to represent each MERS-CoV users on Google maps so that possibly infected users can be quarantined as early as possible. It will help uninfected citizens to avoid regional exposure and the government agencies to manage the problem more effectively. Snapshot of (a) level 3 data matrix containing only MERS-CoV attributes (b) data matrix containing demographic information and MERS attributes (c) data matrix containing all information Case no.
543c6eae46487c76549cb4b347b8ea1b6994d9ac	In a short span, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has captured global consciousness by significantly affecting the day-to-day life of humans and emerged as a public health emergency. Undoubtedly, it indicates that lessons learnt from the past epidemics of coronaviruses such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), had not enough and thus left us ill-prepared to deal with the challenges that COV-ID-19 pandemic is currently posing. Currently, as a global pandemic, COVID-19 poses major challenges and thus forcing the entire world to lockdown. However, the disease has prepared humankind in facing such outbreaks at present as well as in the future. Besides, it has also taught numerous lessons that are worth considering and implementing to make the world a better reality.
92c57d948da77033283198d299eb4642349a6bee	The multi-domain non-structural protein 3 of SARS-coronavirus is a component of the viral replication/ transcription complex (RTC). Among other domains, it contains three sequentially arranged macrodomains: the X domain and subdomains SUD-N as well as SUD-M within the "SARS-unique domain". The X domain was proposed to be an ADP-ribose-1"-phosphatase or a poly(ADP-ribose)-binding protein, whereas SUD-NM binds oligo(G)-nucleotides capable of forming G-quadruplexes. Here, we describe the application of a reverse genetic approach to assess the importance of these macrodomains for the activity of the SARS-CoV RTC. To this end, Renilla luciferase-encoding SARS-CoV replicons with selectively deleted macrodomains were constructed and their ability to modulate the RTC activity was examined. While the SUD-N and the X domains were found to be dispensable, the SUD-M domain was crucial for viral genome replication/transcription. Moreover, alanine replacement of charged amino-acid residues of the SUD-M domain, which are likely involved in G-quadruplex-binding, caused abrogation of RTC activity.
558eec44990e2c8c43145a48bcae68219ae2ba52	Background: From October 2010 through February 2016, Arizona conducted surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) among adults hospitalized in the Arizona-Mexico border region. There are few accurate mortality estimates in SARI patients, particularly in adults ≥ 65 years old. The purpose of this study was to generate mortality estimates among SARI patients that include deaths occurring shortly after hospital discharge and identify risk factors for mortality. Methods: Patients admitted to two sentinel hospitals between 2010 and 2014 who met the SARI case definition were enrolled. Demographic data were used to link SARI patients to Arizona death certificates. Mortality within 30 days after the date of admission was calculated and risk factors were identified using logistic regression models. Results: Among 258 SARI patients, 47% were females, 51% were white, non-Hispanic and 39% were Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (range, 19 to 97 years) and 80% had one or more pre-existing health condition; 9% died in hospital. Mortality increased to 12% (30/258, 30% increase) when electronic vital records and a 30-day posthospitalization time frame were used. Being age ≥ 65 years (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.6-9.9) and having an intensive care unit admission (OR = 7.4; 95% CI: 3.0-17.9) were independently associated with mortality. Conclusion: The use of electronic vital records increased SARI-associated mortality estimates by 30%. These findings may help guide prevention and treatment measures, particularly in high-risk persons in this highly fluid border population.
37f71b88b0091fb0d6232dd9e8ee4cfd7c3b6f64	Background: Respiratory infections are common reasons for hospital admission, and are associated with enormous economic burden due to significant morbidity and mortality. The wide spectrum of microbial agents underlying the pathology renders the diagnosis of respiratory infections challenging. Molecular diagnostics offer an advantage to the current serological and culture-based methods in terms of sensitivity, coverage, hands-on time, and time to results. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the clinical performance of three commercial kits for respiratory viral detection. Study design: The performance of FilmArray Respiratory Panel, AnyplexII RV16, and Argene was compared using clinical respiratory samples (n = 224, comprising 189 nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and 35 endotracheal aspirates), based on common overlapping targets across the platforms. Influenza A "equivocal" and "no-subtype" samples by FilmArray were further compared to a laboratory-developed Influenza A/B test. The overall performance of all three platforms appeared to be comparable with regards to sensitivities (95.8-97.9%) and specificities (96.1-98.0%), detection of coinfections, and distinguishment of influenza from non-influenza cases. "Equivocal" and "no-subtype" samples by FilmArray mostly represented weak Influenza A by laboratory-developed test. Lower respiratory tract samples had comparable final-run success-rates and discordant-rates as compared to UTM. Coronavirus HKU1, which was not targeted by AnyplexII RV16, were detected as OC43. The expected test volume would be the main determinant for the selection of platform. Among the platforms, the FilmArray is the most automated but is of the lowest-throughput and has the highest reagent cost.

463dc0b933a7565e628b69a1550bcd77d177805b	Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a respiratory pathogen in young children and is second only to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a cause of lower respiratory tract infection. PIV type 3 (PIV3) is the most severe. Herein we describe an outbreak of PIV3 in three infants in a neonatal intensive care unit. They were diagnosed on virus culture from pharyngeal swabs. We prevented the spread of the virus using standard infection control procedures and isolation of the symptomatic infants. One infant had severe chronic lung disease and was complicated with recurrent wheezing for a long time. Because RSV and PIV have many structural, pathogenic, epidemiologic, and clinical similarities, we speculate that PIV infection causes recurrent wheezing, as observed with RSV infection. Therefore, physicians must consider recurrent wheezing at the time of treatment of PIV infection early in life.
00154ef181732195c77fc1abd791fa2a996b9099	In eukaryotic cells, protein sorting is a highly regulated mechanism important for many physiological events. After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and trafficking to the Golgi apparatus, proteins sort to many different cellular destinations including the endolysosomal system and the extracellular space. Secreted proteins need to be delivered directly to the cell surface. Sorting of secreted proteins from the Golgi apparatus has been a topic of interest for over thirty years, yet there is still no clear understanding of the machinery that forms the post-Golgi carriers. Most evidence points to these post-Golgi carriers being tubular pleomorphic structures that bud from the trans-face of the Golgi. In this review, we present the background studies and highlight the key components of this pathway, we then discuss the machinery implicated in the formation of these carriers, their translocation across the cytosol, and their fusion at the plasma membrane.

a166581d2ad23a4df466c681ff25fb85c83be87e	Epidemiological studies have revealed that the elderly and those with co-morbidities are most susceptible to COVID-19. To understand the genetic link between aging and the risk of COVID-19, we conducted a multi-instrument Mendelian randomization analysis and found that the genetic variation that leads to a longer lifespan is significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection. The odds ratio is 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.57; P = 1.3 × 10 -4 ) per additional 10 years of life, and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51 to 0.77; P = 7.2 × 10 -6 ) per unit higher log odds of surviving to the 90th percentile age. On the other hand, there was no association between COVID-19 susceptibility and healthspan (the lifespan free of the top seven agerelated morbidities). To examine the relationship at the phenotypic level, we applied various biological aging clock models and detected an association between the biological age acceleration and future incidence and severity of

Methods: We developed strategies to prevent hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19 in obstetric care. Infrastructure, including the fever clinic and wards, were modified. Outpatient volume was controlled and screening processes were strictly performed. Verification of the virus was compulsory for non-surgery and non-emergency patients. Emergency operations were performed in a negative pressure theater with surgeons fully protected. Outcomes were analyzed and the patients' characteristics were evaluated. The effect of intervention on depressed and anxious patients was assessed. Data from the first 2 months of 2019 and 2020 were compared. Results: No in-hospital COVID-19 infections occurred in our unit. During the epidemic, patient volume significantly decreased. While major characteristics of patients were similar, a higher prevalence of gestational hypertension was found in 2020 than in 2019. Psychological
6416d311b8e5e360921299299fc25f039aac823a	The etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV. Similar to other coronaviruses, spike (S)-glycoprotein of the virus interacts with a cellular receptor and mediates membrane fusion to allow viral entry into susceptible target cells. Accordingly, S-protein plays an important role in virus infection cycle and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. To begin to understand its biochemical and immunological properties, we expressed both full-length and ectodomain of the protein in various primate cells. Our results show that the protein has an electrophoretic mobility of about 160 -170 kDa. The protein is glycosylated with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides, which account for approximately 30 kDa of the apparent protein mass. The detection of S-protein by immunoassays was difficult using human convalescent sera, suggesting that the protein may not elicit strong humoral immune response in virus-infected patients. We were able to pseudotype murine leukemia virus particles with S-protein and produce SARS pseudoviruses. Pseudoviruses infected Vero E6 cells in a pH-independent manner and the infection could be specifically inhibited by convalescent sera. Consistent with low levels of antibodies against S-protein, neutralizing activity was weak with 50% neutralization titers ranging between 1:15 to 1:25. To facilitate quantifying pseudovirus-infected cells, which are stained blue with X-Gal, we devised an automated procedure using an ELISPOT analyzer. The high-throughput capacity of this procedure and the safety of using SARS pseudoviruses should make possible large-scale analyses of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV. D

Patient was scanned on February, 25, 2020, when COVID-19 outbreak was unrecognized in our country. She admitted having recent occasional dry cough and fever. A retrospective review of her clinical and laboratory data was strongly suggestive for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. PET/CT images demonstrated hypermetabolic diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs with bilateral nodules. There was no evidence of pleural effusion or prominent mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Radiologists must be aware of COVID-19 presentations on PET/CT scan images during COVID-19 outbreak.

9387f69b21cf032f9469cb0b900beed82aabf5ed	Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) are a genetically diverse group of human caliciviruses that are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis and are detected typically in stool by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or electron microscopy (EM). The application of a rapid nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of NLV RNA in stool is described using the NucliSens † Basic Kit. Primers and probes for the NLV Basic Kit assay were based on the RNA polymerase region of the prototype NLV, Norwalk virus (NV) genome and could consistently detect 10 4 RT-PCR detectable units of NV RNA in a stool filtrate. When compared directly with RT-PCR on a dilution series of NV stool filtrate, the NucliSens † Basic Kit assay was equally sensitive. Cross-reactivity studies with a representative panel of other enteric pathogens were negative. When applied to 15 stool specimens from NV-challenged volunteers, the NASBA Basic Kit application for NV detection yielded 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67% concordance, using RT-PCR as the 'gold standard'. Despite the specificity of the NASBA primer/probe sequences for NV, other representatives from both NLV genogroups I and II could be detected by the Basic Kit assay in outbreak stool specimens, although the results were inconsistent. Our results suggest that the NucliSens † Basic Kit assay provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to RT-PCR for detecting NV RNA in stool specimens. However, improvements in test specificity and primer design will be needed before the assay can be used routinely in the clinical setting. #
0e8767d1dfd2b5c7ea2a1abd29d808ed41839662	Tightly packed complexes of nucleocapsid protein and genomic RNA form the core of viruses and may assemble within viral factories, dynamic compartments formed within the host cells. Here, we examine the possibility that the multivalent RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein (N) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) compacts RNA via protein-RNA liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and that N interactions with host RNA-binding proteins are mediated by phase separation. To this end, we created a construct expressing recombinant N fused to a Nterminal maltose binding protein tag which helps keep the oligomeric N soluble for purification. Using in vitro phase separation assays, we find that N is assembly-prone and phase separates avidly. Phase separation is modulated by addition of RNA and changes in pH and is disfavored at high concentrations of salt. Furthermore, N enters into in vitro phase separated condensates of full-length human hnRNPs (TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2) and their low complexity domains (LCs). However, N partitioning into the 2 LC of FUS, but not TDP-43 or hnRNPA2, requires cleavage of the solubilizing MBP fusion. Hence, LLPS may be an essential mechanism used for SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viral genome packing and host protein co-opting, functions necessary for viral replication and hence infectivity.
63e208f8bb6d536d9b0e1848f5cbca6d53ccf60b	Lesions were induced in the lungs of specific-pathogenfree F344 rats by chronic tobacco smoke exposure. Animals exposed to 7 cigarettes/day were killed after 1, 1.5, or 2 years of exposure. Parallel lifetime exposures induced pulmonary tumors in 9% of the animals. In serially killed animals, four types of lesions were found: 1) perivascular or peri bronchiolar accumulation of Iymphoreticular cells, 2) fibrotic and cellular enlargement of peribronchiolar septa, 3) type" cell hyperplasia with septal fibrosis, and 4) air-space enlargement (emphysema). However, emphysema occurred only in animals exposed to a higher (10 cigarettes) dose of tobacco smoke. Ultrastructural studies showed all of the focal lesions to be infiltrated by cells typical of the inflammatory response. The type" hyperplastic and peribronchiolar alveolar lesions involved larger portions of the parenchyma in fibrotic changes but differed in structure, location, and frequency. The incidence of the peribronchiolar alveolar lesions was temporally related to tumor incidence.-JNCI1982; 69:117-129.

Dengue, scrub typhus, encephalitis/meningitis, malaria etc. are the major tropical fevers in Indian ICUs. Close monitoring and supportive therapy with antibiotics where necessary, are the mainstay of treatment in most of these infections. Rapid identification of treatable infection is imperative for a better outcome.
bd21184623ceed45f1cede4066b540ff330ccb63	Canine kobuvirus (CaKV) is a member of the Picornaviridae family and the Kobuvirus genus. CaKV was first described in fecal samples from diarrheic dogs in the USA in 2011, with subsequent reports in the UK, Italy, South Korea, China, Tanzania, and Japan. CaKV is frequently identified in feces of animals with or without clinical signs of gastroenteritis. The present study investigated the presence of CaKV in fecal samples from 53 diarrheic dogs from Londrina, southern Brazil. Using a RT-PCR assay, CaKV RNA was identified in three dogs, resulting in an overall occurrence rate of 5.7%. In addition, coinfection with canine parvovirus subtype 2b was detected in all CaKV-positive diarrheic fecal samples. Using a phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 gene sequence, the Brazilian CaKV field strains were found to be very similar to a previously identified CaKV strain from Brazil that was found in the tissue of a puppy and were also found to be clustered with other CaKV strains detected worldwide and other kobuvirus strains identified in mouse, feline, and human hosts.
a403deb986d94cc409b3cae89ab121a6f28c2f6c	With the advent of COVID-19, hospitals across the country have largely stopped "elective surgery", including elective spine surgery. We encourage everyone to adhere to the recommendations to only perform urgent/emergent spine operations, which is defined, for example, as those reflecting pathology likely to result in quadriplegia or paraplegia within a three month period. is COVID-19 pandemic also affords us the unique opportunity to assess whether some elective spine surgery can be avoided or, when surgery is necessary, whether other less extensive procedures can be performed. A number of studies have documented unnecessary spine surgery, although the reported frequencies vary. In 2012, Gamache found that 69 (44.5%) of 155 second opinion patients that he had seen over a 14-month period were told by outside spine surgeons that they needed surgery, which he considered unnecessary. [3] In 2013, Epstein evaluated 183 patients who were told by their first-opinion spine surgeons that they needed spine surgery. [2] In her opinion, 60.7% required no surgery, 33.3% were about to undergo the wrong or exceedingly extensive operations, while only 6% were offered the "right" operation. In a 2014 article entitled "Necessary or unnecessary? a critical glance on spine surgery", Raabe et al. noted: "Patients with complaints and symptoms caused by spinal degenerative diseases demonstrate a high rate of spontaneous improvement. " [5] We can debate the degree to which unnecessary surgery occurs, but the fact remains, it does exist. Patients are increasingly being offered too extensive or insufficiently extensive minimally invasive spine operations that increase perioperative risks. [1, 2, 6] In Transfeldt et al. 's study (2010) the risks/ complications increased for more extensive spine operations; they noted a 10% complication rate for decompressive laminectomies alone, a 40% rate for decompressions with limited fusion (1-2 level), and a 56% rate for multilevel full-curve fusions. [6] On the other hand, insufficiently extensive minimally invasive spine procedures, by providing inadequate exposure, also increased perioperative risks: more neurological injuries/deficits, spinal fluid leaks, residual pathology, and/or higher infection rates. [1, 2] Further, it is well documented that instrumented spinal fusions

Sample types include whole blood, plasma, serum, leukocytes, and DNA. The GCB links samples to detailed clinical data available in the GEN-COVID Patient Registry (GCPR). It includes hospitalized patients (74.25%), broken down into intubated, treated by CPAP-biPAP, treated with O2 supplementation, and without respiratory support (9.5%, 18.4%, 31.55% and 14.8, respectively); and non-hospitalized subjects (25.75%), either pauci-or asymptomatic. More than 150 clinical patient-level data fields have been collected and binarized according to the organs/systems primarily affected by COVID-19: heart, liver, pancreas, kidney, chemosensors, innate or adaptive immunity, and clotting system, for further statistics. Hierarchical Clustering analysis identified five main clinical categories: i) severe multisystemic failure with either thromboembolic or pancreatic variant; ii) cytokine storm type either severe with liver involvement or moderate; iii) moderate heart type either with or without liver damage; iv) moderate multisystemic involvement either with or without liver damage; v) mild either with or without hyposmia. GCB and GCPR are further linked to the GEN-COVID Genetic Data Repository (GCGDR), which includes data from Whole Exome Sequencing and high-density SNP genotyping.

This retrospective case series includes the first 370 patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 illness between March 10, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a 242-bed teaching hospital. To determine independent association between demographic factors, comorbidities and AKI incidence, multivariable-logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios adjusted for clinical covariates. Median age of patients was 71 (59-82) years and 44.3% were female. Patients with AKI were significantly older with a higher comorbidity-burden and mortality-rate (58.1% vs 19.6%, p<.001) when compared to those without AKI. Increasing age, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia and being of African-American descent showed higher odds of AKI. Patients with AKI had significantly higher odds of mortality when compared to patients without AKI, and this effect was proportional to the stage of AKI. Increasing age and acute respiratory distress syndrome also revealed higher adjusted odds of mortality. 16 Nimkar et al.
4c382f71807795a8bd3b47a12eb3a4b5e2797975	Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus infection pneumonia in Wuhan City, China, in late 2019, such cases have been gradually reported in other parts of China and abroad. Children have become susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of their immature immune function. As the outbreak has progressed, more cases of novel coronavirus infection/pneumonia in children have been reported. Compared with adults, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less severe, with a lower incidence and susceptibility in children, which results in fewer children being tested, thereby underestimating the actual number of infections. Therefore, strengthening the diagnosis of the disease is particularly important for children, and early and clear diagnosis can determine treatment strategies and reduce the harm caused by the disease to children. According to the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (trial version 7) issued by National Health Committee and the latest diagnosis and treatment strategies for novel coronavirus infection pneumonia in children, this review summarizes current strategies on diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.
e2d740c128e4c07561b726706bd34372ae1044db	The discovery of a previously unknown coronavirus as the causative agent of the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003 stimulated a large number of studies into the molecular biology of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and related viruses. This research has provided significant new insight into the functions and activities of the coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex, a multiprotein complex that directs coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis to replicate and transcribe the large coronavirus genome, a single-stranded, positivesense RNA of~30 kb. In this chapter, we review our current understanding of the expression and functions of key replicative enzymes, such as RNA polymerases, helicase, ribonucleases, ribose-2 0 -O-methyltransferase and other replicase geneencoded proteins involved in genome expression, virus-host interactions and other processes. Collectively, these recent studies reveal fascinating details of an enzymatic machinery that, in the RNA virus world, is unparalleled in terms of the number and nature of virally encoded activities involved in virus replication and host interactions.

Antigenic variation of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus detected by monoclonal antibodies. Vet. Microbiol., 14: 115-124. Mouse myeloma cells (SP2/O) were fused with spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with detergent-solubilized antigen of purified virus, and 21 monoclonal (MC) antibodies reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the T0-163 strain of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus were obtained. Of these MC antibodies, 14, 6 and 1 were IgG1, IgG2a and IgM, respectively. All of the MC antibodies contained light chains of the kappa type. Of these MC antibodies, 8 were found to have neutralization (NT) activity against the T0-163 strain. Comparison of 7 strains of TGE virus by NT tests using our panel of MC antibodies confirmed their close antigenic relationships, but also revealed the occurrence of distinct antigenic differences. These results suggest that there may be at least 6 different epitopes involved in NT reaction on the virion of the T0-163 strain. This notion was confirmed by the competitive binding assay.
2afcb25964dffecced16487185ae91e00c1e75ed	Twenty-nine patients with thalassemia and a median age of 6 years (range 1.1-33 years) were given a BMT from an alternative donor. Six of the 29 donors were HLA-phenotypically identical and two were mismatched relatives, 13 were mismatched siblings and eight were mismatched parents. Six patients received no antigen (relatives), 15 patients one antigen, five patients two antigen and three patients three antigen disparate grafts. Twenty-three patients were in class 2 or class 3, whereas six patients were in class 1. Thirteen patients were given BUCY, nine patients BUCY plus ALG, six patients BUCY plus TBI or TLI and one patient BUCY with prior cytoreductive-immunosuppressive treatment as conditioning. As GVHD prophylaxis four patients received MTX, 22 CsA ؉ MTX ؉ methylprednisolone (MP) and three patients CsA ؉ MP. Thirteen of 29 patients (44.8%) had sustained engraftment. The probability of graft failure or rejection was 55%. There were no significant differences between antigen disparities and graft failure. The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 47.3% and chronic GVHD was 37.5%. The incidence of acute GVHD was higher in patients receiving one or two antigen disparate in the GVHD direction grafts (vs no antigen) (P EQ 0.04; odds ratio 10.8; 95% CI 1.5-115). The probability of overall and event-free survival was 65% and 21%, respectively, with median follow-up of 7.5 years (range 0.6-17 years) for surviving patients. The degree of HLA disparity between patient and donor did not have a significant effect on survival. The incidence of nonhematologic toxicity was low. Transplant-related mortality was 34%. GVHD (acute or chronic) was a major contributing cause of death (50%) followed by infections (30%). We conclude that at present, due to high graft failure and GVHD rates, BMT from alternative donors should be restricted to patients who have poor life expectancies because they cannot receive adequate conventional treatment or because of alloimmunization to minor blood antigens.

d1e0f1d4f39399ed752c91757ddd4ff8e2526f6c	A clinically relevant, subacute, demyelinating encephalomyelitis can be induced in Lewis rats by intracerebral infection with the murine coronavirus JHM. The disease is characterized by hindleg paresis, ataxic gait, and decreased weight gain. Histopathologically, areas of primary demyelination are detectable in brain and spinal cord, infiltrated by mononuclear cells, and in close association with perivascular cuffs of lymphoid cells.' Several observations in recent years support the idea that besides the genetic background of the host and virus, the immune system seems to play a crucial role in the course of the disease. As we showed,' the transfer of basic myelin protein (BMP)-specific T-cell lines, generated from SDE-diseased Lewis rats, causes perivascular cuffing in healthy recipients, indicating autosensitization to brain antigens. Presentation of autoantigens may be associated with the induction of class I1 antigens on rat astrocytes by JHM virus, as shown in in vitro studies? Because SDE-diseased animals reveal a clonally very restricted JHM-specific antibody response with a low titer in the central nervous system: induction of Ia antigens on astrocytes by virus particles that have escaped neutralization is likely to happen in vivo as well. From these data, we wanted to determine the distribution of lymphocyte subsets in the brain of SDE-diseased Lewis rats in relation to virus-infected cells and for the brain cell type infected in or around a demyelinated area revealing intense lymphocyte infiltration. By a combination of computer-aided cytophotometry and immunocytochemistry a multicolored topographic map of a representative demyelinated area in the cerebellum of an SDE animal was developed, revealing the following picture: Adjacent to a perivascular cuff, cytotoxic T cells distribute from the center of the focal demyelination, almost free of virus-infected cells versus the abundantly infected marginal zone. The rim of the plaque is the site where infiltrating T-helper cells are detected in close association with B lymphocytes and macrophages. However, the majority of macrophages show a strong affinity for the center of the plaque, indicating their function as a scavenger cell to eliminate cell debris. Because by double immunofluorescence oligodendrocytes were shown to be a major target for JHM virus in this area, we assume that immune-mediated killing of these cells takes place. This interpretation is 663

Unlike compartmental models, if the basic reproduction number is greater than one there may be a minor outbreak or a major epidemic with a probability depending on the nature of the contact network. We use a network approach to determine the distribution of outbreak and epidemic sizes.
57cfb080e4dd271aa3e4977515d7d62ddf287d7a	A previously developed mechanistic model of COVID-19 transmission has been adapted and applied here to study the evolution of the disease and the effect of intervention measures in some European countries and territories where the disease has had a major impact. A clear impact of the major intervention measures on the reproduction number (R t ) has been found in all studied countries and territories, as already suggested by the drop in the number of deaths over time. Interestingly, the impact of such major intervention measures seems to be the same in most of these countries. The model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcomes. While the predictive capabilities of the model are much more uncertain before the peak of the outbreak, we could still reliably predict the evolution of the disease after a major intervention by assuming the subsequent reproduction number from the current study. A greater challenge is to foresee the long-term impact of softer intervention measures, but this model can estimate the outcome of different scenarios and help to plan changes for the implementation of control measures in a given country or region.
ea501e72360f4ee175c43af5f1ec9ee6bbead337	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel viral pathogen that causes a clinical disease called coronavirus disease 2019 . Approximately 20% of infected patients experience a severe manifestation of the disease, causing bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe COVID-19 patients also have a pronounced coagulopathy with approximately 30% of patients experiencing thromboembolic complications. However, the etiology driving the coagulopathy remains unknown. Here, we explore whether the prominent neutrophilia seen in severe COVID-19 patients contributes to inflammation-associated coagulation. We found in severe patients the emergence of a CD16 Int CD44 low CD11b Int low-density inflammatory band (LDIB) neutrophil population that trends over time with changes in disease status. These cells demonstrated spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, phagocytic capacity, enhanced cytokine production, and associated clinically with D-dimer and systemic IL-6 and TNF-α levels, particularly for CD40 + LDIBs. We conclude that the LDIB subset contributes to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and could be used as an adjunct clinical marker to monitor disease status and progression. Identifying patients who are trending towards LDIB crisis and implementing early, appropriate treatment could improve all-cause mortality rates for severe COVID-19 patients.
afd83a90943b4d9103daaf9507267b65e257c85c	We report a hereditary leukodystrophy in Standard Schnauzer puppies. Clinical signs occurred shortly after birth or started at an age of under 4 weeks and included apathy, dysphoric vocalization, hypermetric ataxia, intension tremor, head tilt, circling, proprioceptive deficits, seizures and ventral strabismus consistent with a diffuse intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a diffuse white matter disease without mass effect. Macroscopically, the cerebral white matter showed a gelatinous texture in the centrum semiovale. A mild hydrocephalus internus was noted. Histopathologically, a severe multifocal reduction of myelin formation and moderate diffuse edema without inflammation was detected leading to the diagnosis of leukodystrophy. Combined linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping in two related families delineated critical intervals of approximately 29 Mb. The comparison of whole genome sequence data of one affected Standard Schnauzer to 221 control genomes revealed a single private homozygous protein changing variant in the critical intervals, TSEN54:c.371G>A or p.(Gly124Asp). TSEN54 encodes the tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 54. In humans, several variants in TSEN54 were reported to cause different types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The genotypes at the c.371G>A variant were perfectly associated with the leukodystrophy phenotype in 12 affected Standard Schnauzers and almost 1000 control dogs from different breeds. These results suggest that TSEN54:c.371G>A causes the leukodystrophy. The identification of a candidate causative variant enables genetic testing so that the unintentional breeding of affected Standard Schnauzers can be avoided in the future. Our findings extend the known genotype-phenotype correlation for TSEN54 variants. Various hereditary diseases of the cerebral white matter occur in humans and dogs. We describe a new leukodystrophy in Standard Schnauzers. Genetic mapping and whole genome sequence analysis identified a likely candidate causative variant in the TSEN54 gene encoding tRNA splicing endonuclease 54. These results provide new information about the role of TSEN54 in cell metabolism and the development of the central nervous system in the late gestational and early post-natal period. The affected dogs potentially represent a translational large animal model for similar leukoencephalopathies in human medicine. The clinical phenotype in Schnauzers included multifocal central nervous system signs. A holistic pathogenically driven understanding of disease initiation and perpetuation requires a solid analysis of the underlying genetics and characterization of the disease phenotype at the clinical and cellular as well as sub-cellular level. In contrast to the canine phenotype with a predominant manifestation in the cerebrum white matter, other TSEN54 variants in humans have been reported to result in a different pathological phenotype characterized by pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The differences between humans and dogs underscore the need for comparative analysis at the clinical, pathological and molecular level to understand species-specific protein mediated pathways, interactions and outcomes.
cc65837c07beb5eedce242ab30fa377907f22546	Background: Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assays have improved diagnostic sensitivity for a wide range of pathogens. However, co-detection of multiple agents and bacterial colonization make it difficult to distinguish between asymptomatic infection or illness aetiology. We assessed whether semi-quantitative microbial load data can differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic states for common respiratory pathogens. Methods: We obtained throat and nasal swab samples from military trainees at two Thai Army barracks. Specimens were collected at the start and end of 10-week training periods (non-acute samples), and from individuals who developed upper respiratory tract infection during training (acute samples). We analysed the samples using a commercial multiplex respiratory panel comprising 33 bacterial, viral and fungal targets. We used random effects tobit models to compare cycle threshold (Ct) value distributions from non-acute and acute samples. We analysed 341 non-acute and 145 acute swab samples from 274 participants. Haemophilus influenzae type B was the most commonly detected microbe (77.4% of non-acute and 64.8% of acute samples). In acute samples, nine specific microbe pairs were detected more frequently than expected by chance. Regression models indicated significantly lower microbial load in non-acute relative to acute samples for H. influenzae non-type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae and rhinovirus, although it was not possible to identify a Ct-value threshold indicating causal etiology for any of these organisms. Conclusions: Semi-quantitative measures of microbial concentration did not reliably differentiate between illness and asymptomatic colonization, suggesting that clinical symptoms may not always be directly related to microbial load for common respiratory infections.
0c812f3ce6c02a87f94a4b914bb50084d34b40db	Background: Typically, African healthcare providers use immunological reference intervals adopted from Europe and the United States (US). This may be inappropriate in a setting with many differences including exposure to different environmental stimuli and pathogens. We compared immunological reference intervals for children from Europe and the US with South African children to explore whether healthy children living in settings with high rates of infectious diseases have different baseline immunological parameters. Methodology: Blood was taken from 381 HIV-uninfected children aged between 2 weeks and 13 years of age from a Child Wellness Clinic in an informal settlement in Cape Town to establish local hematological and lymphocyte reference intervals for South African children. Flow-cytometry quantified percentage and absolute counts of the B-cells, NK-cells, and T-cells including activated, naïve, and memory subsets. These parameters were compared to three separate studies of healthy children in Europe and the US. Results: Increased activated T-cells, and natural killer cells were seen in the younger age-groups. The main finding across all age-groups was that the ratio of naïve/memory CD4 and CD8 T-cells reached a 1:1 ratio around the first decade of life in healthy South African children, far earlier than in resource-rich countries, where it occurs around the fourth decade of life. Conclusions: This is the largest data set to date describing healthy children from an African environment. These data have been used to create local reference intervals for South African children. The dramatic decline in the naïve/memory ratio of both CD4 and CD8 T-cells alongside increased activation markers may indicate that South African children are exposed to a wider range of environmental pathogens in early life than in resource-rich countries. These marked differences illustrate that reference intervals should be relevant to the population they serve. The implications for the developing pediatric immune system requires further investigation.
a987b7d8194376a7108cd8195e0becdae7602081	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused significant economic losses in the US swine industry since May 2013. A new variant strain of PEDV emerged in the US in the late December, 2013. This variant strain of PEDV differs from the virulent strain of PEDV currently circulating in the US in 1170 nt of the 5'end of the S1 domain in the spike gene. Importantly, the variant PEDV caused significantly less mortality in piglets than the virulent PEDV, based on clinical observations. This suggests it may be a potential vaccine candidate for PED. Variant PEDV has been detected in samples from multiple states by our laboratory as well as other laboratories in the US. It is critical to detect and differentiate variant PEDV from the virulent PEDV during outbreaks to enhance control and to prevent PED associated disease. In this study, the development and validation of a duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and differentiation of the variant and the virulent strains of PEDV currently circulating in the US was reported.
97a12343fe4092087873ca1a6912ba114e241a83	Aims To determine whether influenza can trigger heart attacks, we investigated the impact of influenza epidemics on autopsy-proven coronary deaths. We studied weekly death due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and chronic ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in autopsies conducted in 1993 to 2000 in St Petersburg, Russia. We plotted the weekly acute respiratory disease (ARD) counts and influenza epidemics against AMI and chronic IHD deaths. There were 11 892 subjects dying of AMI and 23 000 subjects dying of chronic IHD. Median age was 75 for women and 65 for men. In every year, a peak of AMI and chronic IHD deaths were present and coincided with the influenza epidemic and peak ARD activity. A similar pattern was seen for each subgroup of men, women, subjects 50 years or older, and subjects 70 years or older. When comparing the average influenza epidemic weeks to average off-season weeks, the odds for AMI and chronic IHD death increased by 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.56) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.97-1.26), respectively. Conclusion Influenza epidemics are associated with a rise in autopsy-confirmed coronary deaths. Influenza vaccination should be advocated for patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events.
de0278e203cc2b6e53eff12900b62c2d43809dc4	Following the April 16, 2020 release of the Opening Up America Again guidelines for relaxing COVID-19 social distancing policies, local leaders are concerned about future pandemic waves and lack robust strategies for tracking and suppressing transmission. Here, we present a framework for monitoring COVID-19 hospitalization data to project risks and trigger shelter-in-place orders to prevent overwhelming healthcare surges while minimizing the duration of costly lockdowns. Assuming the relaxation of social distancing increases the risk of infection ten-fold, the optimal strategy for Austin, Texas-the fastest-growing large city in the US-will trigger a total of 135 [90% prediction interval: 126-141] days of sheltering, allow schools to open in the fall, and result in an expected 2929 deaths [90% prediction interval: 2837-3026] by September 2021, which is 29% the annual mortality rate. In the months ahead, policy makers are likely to face difficult choices and the extent of public restraint and cocooning of vulnerable populations may save or cost thousands of lives.
c8acb2428ef77b45f26956feca6582711b08805a	Some clinical reports and epidemiological data suggest that a virus may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Following intracerebral injection of a neurovirululent strain of influenza A virus into mice, the virus was found to be particularly localized in neurons of the substantia nigra and hippocampus. Although efforts to detect virus particles in the brains, or antibodies in the serum or CSF of patients with PD have been generally unsuccessful, recent immunohistochemical work has revealed the presence of complement proteins and the interferon-induced MxA in association with Lewy bodies and swollen neuronal processes. Although a viral etiology for PD is not now widely accepted, we proposed such an hypothesis. Neurovirulent influenza A virus is a candidate, but some other viruses or complex infection of these viruses may be responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies and the later death of nigral neurons.
fc131dc2b4872ee6c3cdd325739368c4e47e242b	Hundreds of thousands of dogs are housed in kennels worldwide, yet there are no standard protocols for assessing the welfare of dogs in these environments. Animal science is focusing increasingly on the importance of animal-based measures for determining welfare states, and those measures that have been used with kennelled dogs are reviewed in this paper with particular focus on their validity and practicality. From a physiological standpoint, studies using cortisol, heart rate and heart rate variability, temperature changes, and immune function are discussed. Behavioural measures are also of great relevance when addressing canine welfare, thus studies on fear and anxiety behaviours, abnormal behaviours like stereotypies, as well as responses to strangers and novel objects are reviewed. Finally, a limited number of studies attempting to use cognitive bias and learning ability are also mentioned as cognitive measures. The literature to date provides a strong background for which measures may be useful in determining the welfare of kennelled canines, however more research is needed to further assess the value of using these methods, particularly in regard to the large degree of individual differences that exist between dogs.
f3cc024f1b8687e7f13ec3602fed80f318b8a890	Here, we present a comprehensive in vitro characterization of the excised iterative, bimodular PCP-TE of the gramicidin S synthetase GrsB, which is able to act both as a ligation and a cyclization catalyst. Using the native pentapeptidylthioester substrates, GrsB PCP-TE catalyzes the dimerization and subsequent formation of the decapeptide lactam gramicidin S. Interestingly, the detection of linear decapeptidyl-SNAC as an enzyme-dependent intermediate supports the iterative mechanism in vivo, in which two pentapeptides, one bound as an ester to the active site serine of the TE domain and the second bound as a thioester to the adjacent pan-PCP, are ligated to a decapeptidyl-pan-PCP that subsequently transferred to the adjacent TE domain and cyclized. Moreover, GrsB PCP-TE can handle different substrates length, leading not only to dimerization, but also to trimerization and the formation of different ring sizes.
fc524fbd93be3db421c75c589e2299524a75fa26	Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in utero might lead to microcephaly and other congenital defects. Since no specific therapy is available thus far, there is an urgent need for the discovery of agents capable of inhibiting its viral replication and deleterious effects. Chloroquine is widely used as an antimalarial drug, anti-inflammatory agent, and it also shows antiviral activity against several viruses. Here we show that chloroquine exhibits antiviral activity against ZIKV in Vero cells, human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human neural stem cells, and mouse neurospheres. We demonstrate that chloroquine reduces the number of ZIKV-infected cells in vitro, and inhibits virus production and cell death promoted by ZIKV infection without cytotoxic effects. In addition, chloroquine treatment partially reveres morphological changes induced by ZIKV infection in mouse neurospheres.
9bfa842ad5cc933a0642dff4fda8e56f64aa676a	A B S T R A C T Bats are highly diverse and ecologically important mammals. They harbor various bacteria, viruses, and fungal communities that are either beneficial or potentially pathogenic. Extensive metagenomic studies in bats are limited, particularly for the gut, and to date, there are no reports on the bacterial diversity of Rhinolophus monoceros from Meghalaya, India. There are limited studies on the isolation of potential harmful or beneficial bacteria and their interactions with the environment through culture-dependent approaches. Therefore, highthroughput screening was used to understand the population structure, genetic diversity, and ecological role of the microorganisms. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker for gene mapping showed that the gut samples constitute a diverse group of bacteria that is dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The bacterial genera Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium were also observed in the Illumina dataset. Illumina sequencing revealed eight bacterial phyla composed of 112 genera. The metagenomic analysis of the OTUs from the gut revealed diverse bacterial communities as well as zoonotic and human pathogens. There were differences in the bacterial communities between the two methods used in this study, which could be related to host specificity, diet, and habitat. The culture-dependent technique resulted in the isolation of 35 bacterial isolates, of which Bacillus cereus and B. anthracis are well-known bacterial pathogens that show virulent traits including hemolytic and proteolytic activities. Pseudomonas stutzeri is an opportunistic human pathogen that was also isolated and showed similar traits. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on all 35 isolates, and different antibiotics were used for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The result showed that some isolates are resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin G and Cefoxitin. This report on gut bacterial communities could attract interest in the possibility of isolating and characterizing bacteria for the production of antibiotics, enzymes, plant growth promoters, and probiotics. However, the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria that may impose health hazards cannot be ignored and needs to be studied further.
2864304d9d9f38db572ca1d8783df6c6bb94a970	This chapter outlines the widespread acceptance of speed as a positive aspect of urban transport during the 20th century, along with a growing recognition in recent decades that speed may not provide the advantages that have long been assumed. In 21st century urban planning, no longer are higher speeds always seen as the main objective. New goals are increasingly recognised as being more important: accessibility, liveability, economic vitality, child-friendliness, sustainability and health. The concept of 'health' in this book applies to human health, as well as economic health and environmental health. We explain how all of these types of health can be enhanced using the simple strategy of slowing city transport. A brief history of increases in transport speed is followed by a discussion of the evolution of the culture of speed in modern societies, to a level that can be compared to an addiction. An important aspect of the culture of speed is the story of motordom, the grouping of automobile clubs, car dealers and car manufacturers that began in the United States in the 1920s. A concerted campaign by motordom comprehensively dismissed the public's negative views on speed. We then outline how, from the 1980s onwards, new thinking began to emerge about motorised city transport, in which the value of slowing it down became more widely discussed. We provide examples of various slow movements that have emerged since the 1980s. While some citizens and policy-makers may question (or even ridicule) the idea of slow movements, we reflect on where the 'fast movement' has taken us over the last 100 years. This chapter concludes with a preview of the chapters and parts of the book.
5f73681fa27e986496cfdb67cb33e6d0d257618e	Background: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are often concurrently detected with other viruses found in the respiratory tract because of the high total number of HRV infections occurring throughout the year. This feature has previously relegated HRVs to being considered passengers in acute respiratory infections. HRVs remain poorly characterized and are seldom included as a target in diagnostic panels despite their pathogenic potential, infection-associated healthcare expenditure and relatively unmoderated elicitation of an antiviral state. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that respiratory viruses are proportionately more or less likely to cooccur, particularly the HRVs. Study design: Retrospective PCR-based analyses of 1247 specimens for 17 viruses, including HRV strains, identified 131 specimens containing two or more targets. We investigated the proportions of co-detections and compared the proportion of upper vs. lower respiratory tract presentations in the HRV positive group. Both univariate contingency table and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify trends of association among the viruses present in co-detections. Results: Many of the co-detections occurred in patterns. In particular, HRV detection was associated with a reduced probability of detecting human adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A virus, and the polyomaviruses KIPyV and WUPyV (p ≤ 0.05). No single HRV species nor cluster of particular strains predominated. Conclusions: HRVs were proportionately under-represented among viral co-detections. For some period, HRVs may render the host less likely to be infected by other viruses.
6dfd251593ed4cecbb1f864a5ada3a36518cd556	Purpose Rib fractures (RF) occur in 10% of trauma patients; associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advancing technology of surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF), treatment and indications remain controversial. Lack of displacement is often cited as a reason for non-operative management. The purpose was to examine RF patterns hypothesizing RF become more displaced over time. Methods Retrospective review of all RF patients from 2016-2017 at our institution. Patients with initial chest CT (CT1) followed by repeat CT (CT2) within 84 days were included. Basic demographics were obtained. Primary outcomes included RF displacement in millimeters (mm) between CT1 and CT2 in three planes (AP = anterior/posterior, O = overlap/gap, and SI = superior/inferior). Displacement was calculated by subtracting CT1 fracture displacement from CT2 displacement for each rib. Given anatomic and clinical characteristics, ribs were grouped (1-2, 3-6, 7-10, 11-12), averaged, and analyzed for displacement. Secondary outcome included number of missed RF on CT1. Non-parametric sign test and paired t test were used for analysis. Significance was set at p < 0.002. Results 78 of 477 patients with RF on CT1 had CT2 during the study period: primarily male (76%) and age 55.8 ± 20.1 with blunt mechanism of injury (99%). Median Injury Severity Score was 21 (IQR, (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) with Chest Abbreviated Injury Score of 3 (IQR, 3-4). Median time between CT1 and CT2 was 6 days (IQR, 3-12). Missed RF rate for CT1 was 10.1% (p = 0.11). Average fracture displacement was significantly increased for all rib groupings except 11-12 in all planes (p < 0.002). Conclusion RF become more displaced over time. Pain regimens and SSRF considerations should be adjusted accordingly.

f98f179b627567d0d171bf027c876e141286f5c2	Background: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant disruption of the practice of pharmacy. Importantly, in many parts of the world, this disruption occurred literally overnight, requiring pharmacists to demonstrate significant adaptability and resiliency in order to manage continuing and in some cases expanding needs of patients. Objectives: The objective of this research was to characterize how community pharmacy in Ontario (Canada) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic of winter/spring 2020, in particula in understanding what factors may influence or predict resiliency of individual practitioners and their workplaces. Methods: One-on-one interviews mediated through technology (Microsoft Teams) were used, following a semi-structured interview protocol. Verbatim transcripts were produced and analyzed by two independent researchers, using an inductive coding process to identify and characterize themes. Results: A total of 21 pharmacists participated in this study. Six themes were identified: a) use of and comfort with technology; b) early adoption of corporate and professional guidance; c) workplaces that emphasized task-focus rather than multi-tasking were more resilient; d) scheduling methods and practices in the workplace are important for personal resilience; e) dedicated specialty staff allowed pharmacists to focus on their work; and f) provision of personal protective equipment was essential. Conclusions: Traditionally, resilience in professional practice has been characterized as a personal, not a workplace, issue. This study suggests that personal resiliency for pharmacists requires substantial workplace support; further work in this area is required to better understand how pharmacists adapt to complex and difficult situations such as pandemics.
1947de7905ed7866459db049ae638553bf963b7b	Lipid rafts often serve as an entry site for certain viruses. Here, we report that lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells are involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infectivity assay showed the integrity of lipid rafts was required for productive infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with MbCD relocalized raft-resident marker caveolin-1 as well as SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 to a nonraft environment, but did not significantly change the surface expression of ACE2. MbCD-treatment inhibited infectivity of pseudotyped SARS-CoV by 90%. Biochemical fractionation and confocal imaging confirmed that ACE2 colocalized with raft-resident markers. Furthermore, an ectodomain of SARS-CoV S protein (S1188HA) could associate with lipid rafts after binding to its receptor, and colocalize with raft-resident marker ganglioside GM1. The binding of S1188HA was not affected by depleting plasma membrane cholesterol. Taken together, our results support that lipid rafts serve as an entry port for SARS-CoV.
abf6f66d8e18b652d10944bb21e19debca5dc5e8	The Scutellaria species (Lamiaceae) is used as a source of flavonoids to treat a variety of diseases in traditional medicine. In spite of many reports about the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of some species of this genus, anticancer researches on one of the Iranian species S. litwinowii have not yet been conducted. The cytotoxic properties of total methanol extract of S. litwinowii and its fractions were investigated on different cancer cell lines including AGS, HeLa, MCF-7, PC12 and NIH 3T3. Meanwhile, the role of apoptosis in this toxicity was explored. The cells were cultured in DMEM medium and incubated with different concentrations of herb plant extracts. Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using propidium iodide staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak). Scutellaria litwinowii inhibited the growth of malignant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among solvent fractions of S. litwinowii, the methylene chloride fraction was found to be more toxic compared to other fractions. The IC 50 values of this fraction against AGS, HeLa, MCF-7 and PC12 cell lines after 24 h were determined, 121.2 ± 3.1, 40.9 ± 2.5, 115.9 ± 3.5 and 64.5 ± 3.4 μg/ml, respectively. Scutellaria litwinowii induced a sub-G1 peak in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells compared to control cells indicating that apoptotic cell death is involved in S. litwinowii toxicity. Scutellaria litwinowii exerts cytotoxic and proapototic effects in a variety of malignant cell lines and could be considered as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment.
8120034dc036e2442b2891046128b7e42a29984c	COVID-19 is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of COVID-19 virus, Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. One important consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle: reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet. 2019 guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease indicate that "Adults should engage in at least 150 minute per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minute per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce ASCVD risk." During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to follow a healthy diet should be implemented. Quarantine carries some longterm effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to good lifestyle.

1008bb267f9b05fcec7b715eab47f4a5c659c7dd	Background: Schools are important foci of influenza transmission and potential targets for surveillance and interventions. We compared several school-based influenza monitoring systems with clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance, and assessed the variation in illness rates between and within schools. Methods: During the initial wave of pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) infections from June to Sept 2009 in Singapore, we collected data on nation-wide laboratory confirmed cases (Sch-LCC) and daily temperature monitoring (Sch-DTM), and teacher-led febrile respiratory illness reporting in 6 sentinel schools (Sch-FRI). Comparisons were made against age-stratified clinic-based influenza-like illness (ILI) data from 23 primary care clinics (GP-ILI) and proportions of ILI testing positive for pdmH1N1 (Lab-ILI) by computing the fraction of cumulative incidence occurring by epidemiological week 30 (when GP-ILI incidence peaked); and cumulative incidence rates between school-based indicators and sero-epidemiological pdmH1N1 incidence (estimated from changes in prevalence of A/California/7/2009 H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition titers ≥ 40 between pre-epidemic and post-epidemic sera). Variation in Sch-FRI rates in the 6 schools was also investigated through a Bayesian hierarchical model. : By week 30, for primary and secondary school children respectively, 63% and 79% of incidence for Sch-LCC had occurred, compared with 50% and 52% for GP-ILI data, and 48% and 53% for Sch-FRI. There were 1,187 notified cases and 7,588 episodes in the Sch-LCC and Sch-DTM systems; given school enrollment of 485,723 children, this represented 0.24 cases and 1.6 episodes per 100 children respectively. Mean Sch-FRI rate was 28.8 per 100 children (95% CI: 27.7 to 29.9) in the 6 schools. We estimate from serology that 41.8% (95% CI: 30.2% to 55.9%) of primary and 43.2% (95% CI: 28.2% to 60.8%) of secondary school-aged children were infected. Sch-FRI rates were similar across the 6 schools (23 to 34 episodes per 100 children), but there was widespread variation by classrooms; in the hierarchical model, omitting age and school effects was inconsequential but neglecting classroom level effects led to highly significant reductions in goodness of fit. Conclusions: Epidemic curves from Sch-FRI were comparable to GP-ILI data, and Sch-FRI detected substantially more infections than Sch-LCC and Sch-DTM. Variability in classroom attack rates suggests localized class-room transmission.
84c48a3f9349698df54da1c719204f5038a502b7	This paper proposes a new method of level set estimation through search space warping using Bayesian optimisation. Instead of a single solution, a level set offers a range of solutions each meeting the goal and thus provides useful knowledge in tolerance for industrial product design. The proposed warping scheme increases performance of existing level set estimation algorithmsin particular the ambiguity acquisition function. This is done by constructing a complex covariance function to warp the Gaussian Process. The covariance function is designed to expand regions deemed to have a high potential for being at the desired level whilst contracting others. Subsequently, Bayesian optimisation using this covariance function ensures that the level set is sampled more thoroughly. Experimental results demonstrate increased efficiency of level set discovery using the warping scheme. Theoretical analysis concerning warping the covariance function, maximum information gain and bounds on the cumulative regret are provided.
fc7e5ad5354977c8df7a4dfa7ffe37eed76a975f	Bats are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and other viruses with zoonotic potential. Florida has indigenous non-migratory populations of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) that mostly roost in colonies in artificial structures. Unlike their counterparts in Brazil and Mexico, the viruses harbored by the Florida bats have been underexplored. We report the detection of an alphacoronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequence in the feces of two of 19 different T. brasiliensis that were capture/release bats that had been evaluated for overall health. The RdRp sequence is similar but not identical to previously detected sequences in the feces of two different species of bats (T. brasiliensis and Molossus molossus) in Brazil. In common with the experience of others doing similar work, attempts to isolate the virus in cell cultures were unsuccessful. We surmise that this and highly related alphacoronavirus are carried by Brazilian free-tailed bats living in a wide eco-spatial region. As various coronaviruses (CoVs) that affect humans emerged from bats, our study raises the question whether CoVs such as the one detected in our work are yet-to-be-detected pathogens of humans and animals other than bats.
8523f5df472506f4b9f57b03f0e26586a8596779	Background 19 Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma mansoni, is of great significance to public health in sub-20 Saharan Africa. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), information on the burden of S. 21 mansoni infection is scarce, which hinders the implementation of adequate control measures. We 22 assessed the geographical distribution of S. mansoni infection across Ituri province in north-eastern 23 DRC and determined the prevailing risk factors. 24 Methods / Principal Findings 25 Two province-wide community-based studies were conducted. First, in 2016, a geographical 26 distribution study was carried out in 46 randomly selected villages, covering 12 of the 36 health 27 districts across Ituri. Second, in 2017, an in-depth study was conducted in 12 purposively-selected 28 villages, across six health districts. In each study village, households were randomly selected and 29 members, aged one year and older and present on the survey day, were enrolled. In 2016, one stool 30 sample was collected per participant, while in 2017, several samples were collected per participant. 31 S. mansoni eggs were detected using the Kato-Katz technique. The 2017 study also incorporated 32 a point-of-care circulating cathodic S. mansoni antigen (POC-CCA) urine test. Household and 33 individual questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic, socioeconomic, 34 environmental, behavioural and knowledge risk factors. 35 The 2016 study included 2,131 participants, 40.0% of whom had S. mansoni infections. Infection 36 prevalence in the villages ranged from 0 to 90.2%. The 2017 study included 707 participants, of 37 whom 73.1% tested positive for S. mansoni. Infection prevalence ranged from 52.8 to 95.0 % across 38 the health districts visited. In general, infection prevalence increased from north to south and from 39 All rights reserved.

Exposure to the waters of Lake Albert and the villages' altitude above sea level were 40 associated with the distribution. 41 Both men and women had the same infection risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.2, 95% confidence interval 42 [CI] 0.82-1.76). Infection prevalence and intensity peaked in the age groups between 10 and 29 43 years. Preschool children were highly infected (62.3%). Key risk factors were poor housing 44 structure (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.02-4.35), close proximity to water bodies (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.1-45 2.49), long-term residence in a community (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11-1.79), lack of latrine in the 46 household (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.11-3.60), and swimming (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.20-5.32) and 47 washing (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.78) in local water bodies. A family history of schistosomiasis 48 (OR 0.52, 95%, 95% CI 0.29-0.94) and knowledge of praziquantel treatment (OR 0.33, 95% CI 49 0.16-0.69) were protective risk factors, while prevention knowledge (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.36-4.08) 50 was associated with increased infection risk. 51 Conclusions/Significance: Our results confirm high endemicity of S. mansoni in Ituri province, 52 DRC. Both the prevalence and intensity of infection, and its relationship with the prevailing 53 socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioural risk factors indicate intense exposure and alarming 54 transmission levels. The study findings warrant control interventions that pay particular attention 55 to high-risk communities and population groups, including preschool children. 56 57 Intestinal schistosomiasis threatens many people in the tropical world, particularly those in Sub-62 Saharan Africa. Information on schistosomiasis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is 63 very scarce, which is a major barrier to planning and implementing efficient control programmes. 64 We conducted two community-based studies with the objective of assessing the geographical 65 distribution of S. mansoni infection across the Ituri province in north-eastern DRC and determining 66 the prevailing risk factors. In 2016, a geographical distribution study was carried out in 46 67 randomly selected villages across the province. In 2017, an in-depth study was conducted in 12 68 purposively selected villages. In both studies, households were randomly selected and members, 69 aged one year and older and present on the survey day, were enrolled. In 2016, one stool sample 70 was examined per participant, whereas several stool samples were examined for each participant 71 in 2017. S. mansoni eggs were detected using the Kato-Katz technique. The 2017 study also 72 included a point-of-care circulating cathodic S. mansoni antigen (POC-CCA) urine test. 73 Household and individual questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic, 74 socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural and knowledge risk factors. The 2016 study included 75 2,131 participants, 40.0% of whom had S. mansoni infections. The 2017 study included 707 76 participants, of whom 73.1% tested positive for S. mansoni. In general, infection prevalence 77 increased from north to south and from west to east. Exposure to the waters of Lake Albert and 78 villages' altitude above sea level were main drivers of the distribution. A risk factor analysis 79 revealed that both men and women had the same infection risk. Infection prevalence and intensity 80 peaked in the age groups between 10 and 29 years. Preschool children were highly infected 81 (62.3%). We identified the main risk factors to be poor housing structure, proximity to water 82 bodies, long-term residence in a community, lack of latrine in the household, and swimming and 83 All rights reserved.

A family history of schistosomiasis and knowledge of praziquantel 84 treatment were protective risk factors, while prevention knowledge was associated with increased 85 infection risk. Our results confirm that S. mansoni is highly endemic in Ituri province, DRC. Both 86 infection prevalence and intensity, and its relationship with the prevailing socioeconomic, 87 environmental, and behavioural risk factors indicate intense exposure and alarming transmission. Control interventions are warranted and should pay attention to high-risk communities and 89 population groups, including preschool children. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
058e306088e83c58ee30b43f0e102a45463351fe	In addition to the impact of a disease itself, public reaction could be considered another outbreak to be controlled during an epidemic. Taiwan's experience with SARS in 2003 highlighted the critical role played by the media during crisis communication. After the SARS outbreak, Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) followed the WHO outbreak communication guidelines on trust, early announcements, transparency, informing the public, and planning, in order to reform its risk communication systems. This article describes the risk communication framework in Taiwan, which has been used to respond to the 2009-2016 influenza epidemics, Ebola in West Africa (2014-16), and MERS-CoV in South Korea (2015) during the post-SARS era. Many communication strategies, ranging from traditional media to social and new media, have been implemented to improve transparency in public communication and promote civic engagement. Taiwan CDC will continue to maintain the strengths of its risk communication systems and resolve challenges as they emerge through active evaluation and monitoring of public opinion to advance Taiwan's capacity in outbreak communication and control. Moreover, Taiwan CDC will continue to implement the IHR (2005) and to promote a global community working together to fight shared risks and to reach the goal of ''One World, One Health.''
16c593d2f8fd5ddd4fea3a61916a8438251c4fe7	Live, attenuated RNA virus vaccines are efficacious but subject to reversion to virulence. Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus (CoV) replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3′→5′ exonuclease (ExoN) activity that probably functions in RNA proofreading. In this study we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged and immunocompromised mice. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or long-term persistent infection in vivo. ExoN inactivation has potential for broad applications in the stable attenuation of CoVs and, perhaps, other RNA viruses. npg
25fcf9b7042d134127c272d27f5a4dda16e0c5ff	Currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear. It is believed that once RABV enters the central nervous system (CNS), virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in the periphery cannot pass through the Blood-brain Barrier (BBB) and into the CNS. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS. In the present study, mouse serum containing VNA was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type RABV. Our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of VNAs is crucial in the clearance of RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced. This present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing VNA therapy for clinical rabies in humans.
2e43703c701890f62073b11b8881bd32549d9654	Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic developed, reports of neurological dysfunctions spanning the central and peripheral nervous systems have emerged. The spectrum of acute neurological dysfunctions may implicate direct viral invasion, para-infectious complications, neurological manifestations of systemic diseases, or co-incident neurological dysfunction in the context of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. A rapid and pragmatic approach to understanding the prevalence, phenotypes, pathophysiology and prognostic implications of COVID-19 neurological syndromes is urgently needed. The Global Consortium to Study Neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID), endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS), was rapidly established to address this need in a tiered approach. Tier-1 consists of focused, pragmatic, low-cost, observational common data element (CDE) collection, which can be launched immediately at many sites in the first phase of this pandemic and is designed for expedited ethical board review with waiver-of-consent. Tier 2 consists of prospective functional and cognitive outcomes assessments with more detailed clinical, laboratory and radiographic data collection that would require informed consent. Tier 3 overlays Tiers 1 and 2 with experimental molecular, electrophysiology, pathology and imaging studies with longitudinal outcomes assessment and would require centers with specific resources. A multicenter pediatrics core has developed and launched a parallel study focusing on patients ages <18 years. Study sites are eligible for participation if they provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients and are able to conduct patient-oriented research under approval of an internal or global ethics committee. Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate. The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period. Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay. Conclusions: This is one of the first large-scale global research collaboratives urgently assembled to evaluate acute neurological events in the context of a pandemic. The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world-an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis.
37a79cbc44e74c59a4a1dbca55aa0aae7e8ca214	The lockdown in response to COVID-19 risks damaging the response to many infectious diseases. We recommend integrating the COVID-19 response into existing public health programs, strengthening both. A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t The world has shut down. Global commerce has screeched to a halt, the movement of people stopped and the supply of goods has slowed. As the world watched the agonies of Wuhan the virus was already spreading amongst us and left many countries with only one option -lockdown. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has surely been a severe reminder of the natural laws of epidemiology that still govern human society. It has sadly exacted the highest toll on the more vulnerable people in our communities. The world of public health needed no reminders of the social determinants of health. The unfair distribution of health and wealth is the shame of our planet and there are many more deadly epidemic reminders of this than the coronavirus. These communicable diseases were with us before and will be with us after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic subsides. Progress has been made combating them but success is fragile and endangered as one of the many collateral damages wrought by COVID-19. In our compelling need to focus on COVID-19 we may lose sight of other existing epidemics and the tally of morbidity and mortality will add to and ultimately dwarf the toll of COVID-19 itself. Here's a small selection of other diseases and people that will be affected.
f04dbab83bd2a6f8cbf16ce7968ca37fbb267415	The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus that poses a major challenge to clinical management. The 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) is essential for viral replication and thus represents a potential target for antiviral drug development. Presently, very few data are available on MERS-CoV 3CL pro inhibition by small molecules. We conducted extensive exploration of the pharmacophoric space of a recently identified set of peptidomimetic inhibitors of the bat HKU4-CoV 3CL pro . HKU4-CoV 3CL pro shares high sequence identity (81%) with the MERS-CoV enzyme and thus represents a potential surrogate model for anti-MERS drug discovery. We used 2 well-established methods: Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)-guided modeling and docking-based comparative intermolecular contacts analysis. The established pharmacophore models highlight structural features needed for ligand recognition and revealed important binding-pocket regions involved in 3CL pro -ligand interactions. The best models were used as 3D queries to screen the National Cancer Institute database for novel nonpeptidomimetic 3CL pro inhibitors. The identified hits were tested for HKU4-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL pro inhibition. Two hits, which share the phenylsulfonamide fragment, showed moderate inhibitory activity against the MERS-CoV 3CL pro and represent a potential starting point for the development of novel anti-MERS agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pharmacophore modeling study supported by in vitro validation on the MERS-CoV 3CL pro . • MERS-CoV is an emerging virus that is closely related to the bat HKU4-CoV. • 3CL pro is a potential drug target for coronavirus infection. • HKU4-CoV 3CL pro is a useful surrogate model for the identification of MERS-CoV 3CL pro enzyme inhibitors. • dbCICA is a very robust modeling method for hit identification. • The phenylsulfonamide scaffold represents a potential starting point for MERS coronavirus 3CL pro inhibitors development.
76c441d38046d066509393638c07fbaf978eae56	We demonstrate a series of studies of semantic predications from Semantic MEDLINE, including the detection of semantic predications with burstness and in association with conflict, contradictory, or other sources of uncertainties of scientific knowledge. Semantic networks of predications are analyzed within the framework of structural variations. Examples in this chapter represent scientific knowledge at a level of granularity that differs from those studies of scientific knowledge at the level of articles or journals of scholarly communication.
e11c9bc546854f029012101671bd77e9d19c35ea	There is plenty of evidence to support that women leaders are needed in the health and pharmaceutical sectors, although most of the leadership positions in global health are predominantly occupied by men. This is a major challenge to global health policy. Gender diversity and inclusion within the pharmaceutical workforce is integral to optimal patient care. Women continue to be underrepresented in senior and leadership positions within pharmacy, despite outnumbering the men in the global pharmacy workforce. This commentary highlights the need towards gender equity and discusses the several key initiatives that are building momentum and making substantial progress towards this agenda in the pharmaceutical workforce.
7877d1209e134ea8429c0411567012aef23f70e1	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread forecasting is an important task to track the growth of the pandemic. Existing predictions are merely based on qualitative analyses and mathematical modeling. The use of available big data with machine learning is still limited in COVID-19 growth prediction even though the availability of data is abundance. To make use of big data in the prediction using deep learning, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) method to learn the correlation of COVID-19 growth over time. The structure of an LSTM layer is searched heuristically until the best validation score is achieved. First, we trained training data containing confirmed cases from around the globe. We achieved favorable performance compared with that of the recurrent neural network (RNN) method with a comparable low validation error. The evaluation is conducted based on graph visualization and root mean squared error (RMSE). We found that it is not easy to achieve the same quantity of confirmed cases over time. However, LSTM provide a similar pattern between the actual cases and prediction. In the future, our proposed prediction can be used for anticipating forthcoming pandemics.

e8e89754901d55fd3808709f4308f5f41e53a0e4	Background: Otolaryngologists represent a subset of health care workers uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission. Given the segmentation of extant guidelines concerning precautions and protective equipment for SARS-CoV2, we aimed to provide consolidated recommendations regarding appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in head neck surgery during the COVID-19 era. were reviewed in conjunction with published literature concerning COVID-19 transmission risk, testing, and PPE, to compile situation-specific recommendations for head and neck providers managing COVID-19 patients. Results: High-quality data regarding the aerosolization potential of head and neck instrumentation and appropriate PPE during head and neck surgeries are lacking. However, extrapolation of recommendations by governing bodies suggests strongly that head and neck mucosal instrumentation warrants strict adherence to airborne-level precautions. Conclusion: We present a series of situation-specific recommendations for PPE use and other procedural precautions for otolaryngology providers to consider in the COVID-19 era.
d38ba4f11537cfe4099d450d6f2a0371b30064ec	Background: The emergence of novel respiratory viruses such as avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the importance of understanding determinants of transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs) and the public. Objectives: We aim to determine the viral content of the air emitted by symptomatic inpatients or longterm care residents with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection (emitters), and in the breathing zones of healthcare workers who attend to them. Design: A prospective pilot study of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was undertaken. Air within 1 m of the patient was sampled using a high volume air sampler. In addition, a lower volume air sampler was placed <1 m from the patient, with another >1 m from the patient. Viral RNA was recovered from the samplers and submitted for quantitative real time PCR. In addition, personal button samplers were provided to HCWs. Results: The air emitted by 15 participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was sampled. Of the patients infected with influenza A, viral RNA was recovered from the air emitted by 9/12 patients using the low-volume sampler; no viral RNA was detected from air emitted by patients with influenza B (n = 3). Influenza virus RNA was recovered from one HCW's sampler. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory virus infection emit virus into the air which disperses to >1 m and may reach the breathing zone of a HCW. This pilot study highlights the feasibility and importance of conducting a larger-scale study to identify determinants of exposure and transmission from patient to HCW.
687431d0054067f8265d04e56d7556be7c715a63	To provide optimal cut-off values of anti-Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) serologic tests, we evaluated performance of ELISA IgG, ELISA IgA, IFA IgM, and IFA IgG using 138 serum samples of 49 MERS-CoV-infected patients and 219 serum samples of 219 rRT-PCR-negative MERS-CoV-exposed healthcare personnel and patients. The performance analysis was conducted for two different purposes: (1) prediction of neutralization activity in MERS-CoV-infected patients, and (2) epidemiologic surveillance of MERS-CoV infections among MERS-CoV-exposed individuals. To evaluate performance according to serum collection time, we used 'days post onset of illness (dpoi)' and 'days post exposure (dpex)' assessing neutralization activity and infection diagnosis, respectively. Performance of serologic tests improved with delayed sampling time, being maximized after a seroconversion period. In predicting neutralization activity, ELISA IgG tests showed optimal performance using sera collected after 21 dpoi at cut-off values of OD ratio 0.4 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 100%), and ELISA IgA showed optimal performance using sera collected after 14 dpoi at cut-off value of OD ratio 0.2 (sensitivity 85.2% and specificity 100%). In diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection, ELISA IgG exhibited optimal performance using sera collected after 28 dpex, at a cut-off value of OD ratio 0.2 (sensitivity 97.3% and specificity 92.9%). These new breakpoints are markedly lower than previously suggested values (ELISA IgG OD ratio 1.1, sensitivity 34.8% and specificity 100% in the present data set), and the performance data help serologic tests to be practically used in the field of MERS management.
1963efabf6787b33386d7589664bd108ad7f01ba	We identified novel viruses in feces from cattle with diarrhea collected in 2009 in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, by using a metagenomics approach and determined the (near) complete sequences of the virus. Sequence analyses revealed that they had a standard picornavirus genome organization, i.e. 5 untranslated region (UTR) -LUTR-poly(A). They are closely related to other unclassified Chinese picornaviruses; bat picornaviruses group 1-3, feline picornavirus, and canine picornavirus, sharing 45.4-51.4% (P1), 38.0-44.9% (P2), and 49.6-53.3% (P3) amino acid identities, respectively. The phylogenetic analyses and detailed genome characterization showed that they, together with the unclassified Chinese picornaviruses, grouped as a cluster for the P1, 2C, 3CD and VP1 coding regions. These viruses had conserved features (e.g. predicted protein cleavage sites, presence of a leader protein, 2A, 2C, 3C, and 3D functional domains), suggesting they have a common ancestor. Reverse-transcription-PCR assays, using specific primers designed from the 5 UTR sequence of these viruses, showed that 23.0% (20/87) of fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea were positive, indicating the prevalence of these picornavirus in the Japanese cattle population in Hokkaido Prefecture. However, further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic potential and etiological role of these viruses in cattle.

c50ca36baaf68c608752a064bff0937b0269955f	Cigarette smoking is one of the main preventable causes of cancers globally. At this time of global emergency, mental health professionals all over the world are joining hands with the public health and other healthcare communities to focus on acute measures to save lives from COVID-19. This has been particularly challenging in mental health hospital settings where numerous additional factors need to be considered, including difficulties of implementing social distancing, potential impacts of social isolation, increased stress levels and implications of all this on smoking. In this article, we will briefly discuss the prevalence of smoking in mental health patients, especially in those in mental health hospital settings and also what is the possible impact of COVID-19 pandemic in these people. Then we will go through the main reasons as to why encouraging smoking cessation in mental health patients is so important and measures we can take for supporting mental health patients quit smoking even during COVID-19 times. The smoking cessation interventions have a direct bearing on preventing future cancers and achieving smoking cessation among cancer patients in this already disadvantaged group.
e7b32033fd060e6a1a231c22558cca24c83a67c5	read with great attention and interest the review by Robba and colleagues on mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with acute ischemic stroke [1] . The authors examined the pathophysiology of stroke and the risk for pulmonary complications (brain-lung "dangerous" crosstalk, immunological response after stroke, stroke-associated pneumonia, and dysphagia) then concluding with useful recommendations on optimal ventilator settings and therapeutic strategies. Several preclinical evidence supports that MV correlates with neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction [2, 3] . Surprisingly the authors in their review cite a paper from Hegeman and colleagues that challenge the hypothesis of the relationship between MV and brain inflammation state: "In the brain, MV did not induce a significant change in adhesion molecule mRNA expression as compared with non-ventilated controls, […] did not induce a detectable cytokine or chemokine response, [...] myeloperoxidase activity was below detection level in all experimental groups" [4] . Of interest, the study from Klinger and colleagues reported evidence on the effect of intravenous lidocaine on the transcerebral inflammatory response during cardiac surgery [5] . In their randomized controlled clinical trial, the authors aimed to investigate the potential antineuroinflammatory effect of intravenous lidocaine and observed "a reduction in the transcerebral activation of platelet-monocyte conjugates after aortic cross-clamp release. This may be a manifestation of reduced cerebral inflammation during cardiopulmonary bypass in response to treatment with lidocaine". To conclude, do the authors, according to the collected evidence, consider it relevant to the neuroinflammation associated with MV? Do the authors consider it worthy-in patients with acute brain damage-to establish an appropriate antiinflammatory therapy for preventing additional iatrogenic damage, for example, by taking advantage of the blunting effect of lidocaine on neuroinflammatory response? Battaglini D; Bonatti G; Robba C; Rocco PRM; Pelosi P Dear Editor, We thank Professor Bilotta and colleagues for their interest in our recent scientific contribution [1] . The authors pointed out the role of neuroinflammation due to mechanical ventilation in stroke, thus advising the relevance of possible novel pharmacological strategies. First, we were asked to clarify our point of view regarding the existence of significant neuroinflammation induced by mechanical ventilation in stroke, as challenged by Hegeman and colleagues [4] . We fully agree with the importance of neuroinflammation due to mechanical ventilation in stroke patients, and in our review, discussed only few of those papers referring to neuromodulation in stroke. Different perspectives have been reported in the literature, which focus on the complex interaction among the neuroendocrine, neuroinflammatory, autonomic and immunologic pathways, both implicated in lung injury that can affect the brain [6]. Furthermore, different neuromodulation patterns, as well as different brain-lung interactions, may occur due to mechanical ventilation or primary cerebral pathologies. Second, as suggested, novel anti-inflammatory therapies for modulating the neuroinflammatory response (such as lidocaine) could play a role in the near future. This is another interesting issue that we did not take into consideration in our review, which focused on mechanical ventilation strategies in stroke. Experimental and clinical perspectives suggest a wide range of promising therapies

Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed during the cell-intrinsic immune response to viral infection. IFIT1 inhibits translation by binding directly to the 5' end of foreign RNAs, particularly those with non-self cap structures, precluding the recruitment of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F and subsequent 40S recruitment. Interaction of different IFIT family members is well described, but little is known of the molecular basis of IFIT association or its impact on function. Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 interacts rapidly and strongly with IFIT3 forming a stable heterotetramer. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that associates with IFIT1, forming an IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 trimer. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a C-terminal 'YxxxL' motif in IFIT1 that mediates its association with IFIT3. Using various reporter mRNAs, we demonstrate for the first time that IFIT3 stabilises IFIT1 binding to cap0-mRNA and enhances its translation inhibition activity. Disrupting the binding interface between IFIT1 and IFIT3 abrogated this enhancement. This work reveals molecular aspects of IFIT assembly and provides an important 'missing link' between IFIT interaction and function. author/funder. All rights reserved.

For reporter RNA transcription, the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fluc) was PCR amplified using primers containing the 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences of human -globin (NM_000518.4), including a 5' T7 promotor and EcoRI and PstI sites to facilitate cloning into pUC57. pUC57-ZIKV-Fluc was previously described (30). Recombinant IFITs were expressed in Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Cells were grown to an OD600 of approximately 1 in 2x TY media at 37 C. Expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside. The induced culture was incubated at 22 C for 16 hours. Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 400 mM KCl, 5 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (from hen egg). IFITs were isolated by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA Agarose beads (Qiagen). IFIT1 and IFIT1 mutants were additionally purified by FPLC on MonoQ (Q buffer: 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 100-500 mM KCl), followed by MonoS 5/50 GL (S buffer: 30 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 100-500 mM KCl).

bb4fdc8ce14ef521c95c736cf7a93182dfbb2d53	Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to change much about the way we practice radiology in the near future. The power of AI tools has the potential to offer substantial benefit to patients. Conversely, there are dangers inherent in the deployment of AI in radiology, if this is done without regard to possible ethical risks. Some ethical issues are obvious; others are less easily discerned, and less easily avoided. This paper explains some of the ethical difficulties of which we are presently aware, and some of the measures we may take to protect against misuse of AI. Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) together wrote a multi-society statement of the ethics of AI in radiology, published as a summary in four leading journals (Insights into Imaging [5], JACR, Radiology and CARJ), with the full statement published on the societies' websites [6] . The statement considered ethical issues that may arise from many aspects of deep learning, with specific reference to radiology applications. It sought to identify key issues, and to provide guidance on how potential problems can be avoided or solved. Within the full statement, the possible ethical dilemmas or abuses that could arise, deliberately or inadvertently, from AI applications in radiology have been reviewed. Other national societies have published consensus recommendations on the ethical use of AI, such as the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology [7], the Canadian Association of Radiologists [8], and the French Radiology Community [9] . The aim of the review is to discuss some technological drawbacks of AI, certain related ethical issues, and to address potential solutions.
a71c772cbd63e255bc480a963bfb2ab4f655f595	We present a method of generalization of the Lovász extension formula combining two known approaches -the first of them based on the replacement of the product operator by some suitable binary function F and the second one based on the replacement of the minimum operator by a suitable aggregation function A. We propose generalization by simultaneous replacement of both product and minimum operators and investigate pairs (F, A) yielding an aggregation function for all capacities.
ceaf1ce77440c43549de7a989c28376495b57e61	Objective: The spike (S) protein of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) may mediate infection by binding to a cellular neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). This study aimed to identify the crucial domain of the S1 subunit of the S protein that interacts with NCAM. Methods: Three truncated segments (S 1-291 , S 277-794 and S 548-868 ) of the S gene of PHEV and the NCAM gene were cloned individually into the Escherichia coli expression vectors and yeast two-hybrid expression vectors. The interaction between S 1-291 , S 277-794 , S 548-868 and NCAM were detected by a GST pull-down experiment and yeast two-hybrid assay. Results: Three fusion proteins (S 1-291 , S 277-794 and S 548-868 ) were screened for their interactions with NCAM by protein-protein interaction assays. The results of these assays clarified that S 277-794 interacted with NCAM, while S 1-291 and S 548-868 did not. Conclusions: A small fragment (258-amino-acid fragment, residues 291-548) on the PHEV S protein was posited to be the minimum number of amino acids necessary to interact with NCAM. This fragment may be the receptorbinding domain that mediates PHEV binding to NCAM.
603a2415d7b9818f7becaf745a9fc8dc58869f79	Aptamers are nucleic acid ligands that are generated artificially by in vitro selection and behave similar to antibodies. The development of aptamer-based sensing systems or strategies has been in vogue for the past few decades, because aptamers are smaller in size, stable, cheaper and undergo easier modifications. Owing to these advantages, several facile aptamer-based colorimetric strategies have been created by controlling the assembly and disassembly of aptamers on unmodified gold nanoparticle probes. As these kinds of assay systems are rapid and can be visualized unaided by instruments, they have recently become an attractive method of choice. The formation of purple-colored aggregates (attraction) from the red dispersed (repulsion) state of GNPs in the presence of mono-or divalent ions is the key principle behind this assay. Due to its simplicity and versatility, this assay can be an alternative to existing diagnostic assays. Here, we have investigated the critical elements involved in colorimetric assays, and have screened different proteins and small ligands to evaluate biofouling on GNPs.
7a42dabec620c6d9bf9133f5c40700a103d78146	Although membrane fusion occurs ubiquitously and continuously in all eukaroytic cells, little is known about the mechanism that governs lipid bilayer fusion associated with any intracellular fusion reactions. Recent studies of the fusion of enveloped viruses with host cell membranes have helped to define the fusion process. The identification and characterization of key proteins involved in fusion reactions have mainly driven recent advances in our understanding of membrane fusion. The most important denominator among the fusion proteins is the fusion peptide. In this review, work done in the last few years on the molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion will be highlighted, focusing in particular on the role of the fusion peptide and the modification of the lipid bilayer structure. Much of what is known regarding the molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion has been gained using liposomes as model systems in which the molecular components of the membrane and the environment are strictly controlled. Many amphilphilic peptides have a high affinity for lipid bilayers, but only a few sequences are able to induce membrane fusion. The presence of α-helical structure in at least part of the fusion peptide is strongly correlated with activity whereas, β-structure tends to be less prevalent, associated with non-native experimental conditions, and more related to vesicle aggregation than fusion. The specific angle of insertion of the peptides into the membrane plane is also found to be an important characteristic for the fusion process. A shallow penetration, extending only to the central aliphatic core region, is likely responsible for the destabilization of the lipids required for coalescence of the apposing membranes and fusion.
5df04f27c3f80940bdfc868512ca5d8942c70bf1	Although children's health is not directly affected to the same extent as adults by the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken by governments to restrain the spread of the virus have a big impact on children with disabilities and their families. On 12 March, the first measures were taken in the Netherlands, including reducing medical therapies to focus on life-saving treatments in the hospitals. Moreover, schools and day care centres were closed per 16 March. This meant that the majority of rehabilitation treatments taking place in schools, day care centres, hospitals and rehabilitation centres were postponed. However, the measures that were taken were not unambiguous. There was discussion about what therapies were-although not life-savingessential to prevent later adverse events, and the effects of school closing on child health. The Dutch Academy of Childhood Disability performed an inquiry among therapists and paediatric rehabilitation physicians in the Netherlands to provide us with insight on the way the measures were interpreted and effectuated. Starting 8 April, we conducted a survey study in which open questions were asked about the way the governments' measures were interpreted and which therapies and care were considered essential and were thus continued. In total, 237 therapists and physicians working in rehabilitation units in hospitals, day care centres and rehabilitation centres responded. Results of the survey show that there was large variation in the therapies and care that were continued despite the governments' measures. Whereas some clinics cancelled all therapies, others continued specific treatments such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and serial casting. We found that there was no unanimous interpretation of what urgent/essential care is. The most mentioned interpretation was 'care that, if postponed, leads to irreversible damage or functional limitations'. Therapists, together with physicians, decided whether treatments fit this definition. In all clinics and hospitals, treatments were continued by telehealth, where possible. As described by Fazzi and Galli (2020), telehealth strategies were implemented quickly. The most important strategy was doing video consultations. Our respondents were generally quite satisfied with this relative new treatment modality. However, despite the possibility of telehealth, therapists reported serious worries because some specific subgroups of vulnerable children and families proved hard to keep in touch with. Moreover, they worried about children with progressive conditions. Additionally, there were signs that the strain was high for some families, because physical therapy had to be delivered by parents themselves while healthy siblings were also at home and required attention. Lastly, children who do not have a laptop or tablet computer cannot take advantage of telehealth innovations, making differences between groups of children larger. These points underline the need to understand the increased risks for vulnerable children and how to minimize them with evidence-based service delivery. The lockdown also brought creativity and new ideas at light. Implementing new technology suddenly was done faster than previously deemed possible, and many therapists found new ways to provide therapies, for instance, through instructional YouTube videos, the use of short videos made by parents about specific problems at home, and Pinterest pages with activities for children to be carried out. Also, social media were used to maintain communication between therapists and to share ideas about telehealth strategies. Good support for information and communications technology (ICT) therefore proved an essential prerequisite for these digital solutions. These creative ideas might further support parental empowerment and involvement in the (rehabilitation) treatment in the future. The lockdown and postponement of therapy provide us with insight in the need for therapy by children with disabilities. The next months, we have the ability to reflect critically on what effects the change in therapy has on children with disabilities and on the way we provide services in the new situation. The discussion on 'best care' could possibly get an extra impulse with these new findings in mind (Novak, 2020) . Further research that has been started by the European Academy of Childhood Disability should provide insight in the way parents and families themselves experienced the lockdown in European countries. We believe that despite all negative aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can and should learn from the innovations and transformations for the future.
f4298dd5a7f7fc59b49989fff508a0361e461875	, are increasingly recommending the use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) in health care settings. For infection control purposes, the usual practice is to discard FFRs after close contact with a patient ("single use"). However, in some situations, such as during contact with tuberculosis patients, limited FFR reuse (i.e., repeated donning and doffing of the same FFR by the same person) is practiced. A related practice, extended use, involves wearing the same FFR for multiple patient encounters without doffing. Extended use and limited FFR reuse have been recommended during infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics to conserve FFR supplies. This commentary examines CDC recommendations related to FFR extended use and limited reuse and analyzes available data from the literature to provide a relative estimate of the risks of these practices compared to single use. Analysis of the available data and the use of disease transmission models indicate that decisions regarding whether FFR extended use or reuse should be recommended should continue to be pathogen-and event-specific. Factors to be included in developing the recommendations are the potential for the pathogen to spread via contact transmission, the potential that the event could result in or is currently causing a FFR shortage, the protection provided by FFR use, human factors, potential for self-inoculation, the potential for secondary exposures, and government policies and regulations. While recent findings largely support the previous recommendations for extended use and limited reuse in certain situations, some new cautions and limitations should be considered before issuing recommendations in the future. In general, extended use of FFRs is preferred over limited FFR reuse. Limited FFR reuse would allow the user a brief respite from extended wear times, but increases the risk of self-inoculation and preliminary data from one study suggest that some FFR models may begin to lose effectiveness after multiple donnings.
39fae6df128e98e970b22ea35cebdaaac78a647e	Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a contagious respiratory pathogen that is contracted via close contact with an infected subject. Transmission of the pathogen has occurred through animal-to-human contact at first followed by human-to-human contact within families and health care facilities. This study is based on a retrospective analysis of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and July 2015. A Geoadditive variable model for binary outcomes was applied to account for both individual level risk factors as well spatial variation via a fully Bayesian approach. Out of 959 confirmed cases, 642 (67%) were males and 317 (33%) had died. Three hundred and sixty four (38%) cases occurred in Ar Riyad province, while 325 (34%) cases occurred in Makkah. Individuals with some comorbidity had a significantly higher likelihood of dying from MERS-CoV compared with those who did not suffer comorbidity [Odds ratio (OR) = 2.071; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.307, 3.263]. Health-care workers were significantly less likely to die from the disease compared with non-health workers [OR = 0.372, 95% CI: 0.151, 0.827]. Patients who had fatal clinical experience and those with clinical and subclinical experiences were equally less likely to die from the disease compared with patients who did not have fatal clinical experience and those without clinical and subclinical experiences respectively. The odds of dying from the disease was found to increase as age increased beyond 25 years and was much higher for individuals with any underlying comorbidities.
b54932936d9dd6f8a399f23e19d0a1d0aeabd954	Endothelium is a community of endothelial cells (ECs), which line the blood and lymphatic vessels, thus forming an interface between the tissues and the blood or lympha. This strategic position of endothelium infers its indispensable functional role in controlling vasoregulation, haemostasis, and inflammation. The state of endothelium is simultaneously the cause and effect of many diseases, and this is coupled with modifications of endothelial phenotype represented by markers and with biochemical profile of blood represented by biomarkers. In this paper, we briefly review data on the functional role of endothelium, give definitions of endothelial markers and biomarkers, touch on the methodological approaches for revealing biomarkers, present an implicit role of endothelium in some toxicological mechanistic studies, and survey the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in modulation of endothelial status.

4b4869e7aca5101fa715656390def378b55ed95e	Purpose To explore the dynamic changes and correlation between CT imaging manifestations and cellular immunity of COVID-19. Materials and methods This retrospective review analyzed 23 patients with COVID-19, including 13 males and 10 females aged 27-70 years, with an average age of 48 years. Patients were divided into two groups: group A with 11 critical-severe patients, and group B with 12 common-mild patients. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected and analyzed. Results LYM, LYM (%), CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ decreased, while NEU (%), CRP, and CT scores increased in all patients, WBC in group A increased. In group A, on day 10-12 after disease onset, CT scores and CRP reached the highest point, and day 13-15 LYM, LYM (%) reached the lowest but NEU (%) and WBC reached the highest, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ were at the lowest on day 10-15. In group B, on day 7-9, CT scores, NEU (%) and CRP reached the peak, but LYM, LYM (%), CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ reached the lowest. In all patients, CT scores had a significantly negative correlation with CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, LYM (%), and LYM (p = 0.001, r = − 0.797; p = 0.008, r = − 0.698; p = 0.002, r = − 0.775; p < 0.001, r = − 0.785; p = 0.021, r = − 0.571, respectively), and a significantly positive correlation with WBC and NEU (%) (p < 0.001, r = 0.785; p = 0.003, r = 0.691, respectively). Conclusion Dynamic changes of CT manifestations and cellular immunity of patients with COVID-19 were regular and correlation was high between these two parameters.
9bc0a2fdfd9f548641eb5d519f1da8f0a0df90d0	We explored the relationships between lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, pulmonary inflammation index (PII) and disease evolution in patients with (corona virus disease 2019) COVID-19. A total of 123 patients with COVID-19 were divided into mild and severe groups. Lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected on the first day of hospital admission and lung computed tomography results were quantified by PII. Difference analysis and correlation analysis were performed on the two groups. A total of 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included in the analysis. There were significant differences in cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4 + T), cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8 + T), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and PII between the two groups. There were significant positive correlations between CD4 + T and CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10 in the mild group (r 2 = 0Á694, r 2 = 0Á633, respectively; P < 0Á01). After 'five-in-one' treatment, all patients were discharged with the exception of the four who died. Higher survival rates occurred in the mild group and in those with IL-6 within normal values. CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 and PII can be used as indicators of disease evolution, and the PII can be used as an independent indicator for disease progression of COVID-19.
0f6b1645fdc27b32ae9fdb4f99dbbb30eb1dfd7f	Background: Dengue virus is endemic in peninsular Malaysia. The clinical manifestations vary depending on the incubation period of the virus as well as the immunity of the patients. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in Malaysia where the incidence is 3.2%. It has been noted that some G6PD-deficient individuals suffer from more severe clinical presentation of dengue infection. In this study, we aim to investigate the oxidative responses of DENV2infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals. Methodology: Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals were infected with DENV2 and infection rate, levels of oxidative species, nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anions (O 2 2 ), and oxidative stress were determined and compared with normal controls. Principal Findings: Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals exhibited significantly higher infection rates compared to normal controls. In an effort to explain the reason for this enhanced susceptibility, we investigated the production of NO and O 2 2 in the monocytes of individuals with G6PD deficiency compared with normal controls. We found that levels of NO and O 2 2 were significantly lower in the DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals compared with normal controls. Furthermore, the overall oxidative stress in DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals was significantly higher when compared to normal controls. Correlation studies between DENV-infected cells and oxidative state of monocytes further confirmed these findings.
20f1137081343b7abd7d02bc025a2b0c17b1973f	Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes critical disease in approximately 5% of affected patients, particularly the elderly, hypertensive, obese and immunocompromised. Patients with haematological cancer, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), are particularly at risk of complications. Very rarely, patients with extreme leukocytosis may develop spurious hypoxemia, or pseudohypoxemia, which confuses the diagnosis of complications and can lead to intervention errors. We report the case of a patient with CLL, severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 and pseudohypoxemia. LEARNING POINTS • Patients with haematological neoplasms are susceptible to viral, bacterial and fungal infections, and are thus at risk of COVID-19. • Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may rarely, due to a high lymphocyte count, present with spurious, or in vitro, hypoxemia. • The clinician must identify and properly treat such cases to prevent any unnecessary treatments and their complications.
6f1147e6ef3655b492445aa7ea50ef5fa0b32b5d	We consider a deterministic epidemiological compartmental model that includes age and social contact structure for the COVID-19 crisis and explore the consequences of different strategies for easing current lockdown measures that are in place in many countries. We apply the model to the specific circumstances in the state of New Jersey, in the United States of America. As expected, only a rigorous program of testing, tracing and isolation of cases will allow the state to ease its lockdown with a reduced number of deaths. We also find that a slightly earlier date of lockdown, while reducing the number of deaths in the short term, will only reduce the total number of deaths in the long run if the ensuing strategies in easing the lockdown are carried out with the aforementioned test, trace and isolation program. Otherwise, a slightly earlier lockdown will result in increased deaths as the expected second wave of infection sweeps through the state in the coming months.

807cc20de41c4d6fb5c6fcf5296e58135ba94a6b	The spread of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the

This case report describes the antemortem diagnosis of FIP in a 2-year-old spayed female Sphinx cat that presented with a bilateral panuveitis and multiple papular cutaneous lesions. Histopathologically, the skin lesions were characterized by perivascular infiltrates of macrophages, neutrophils, with fewer plasma cells, mast cells, and small lymphocytes in the mid-to deep dermis. Immunohistochemistry for intracellular feline coronavirus (FeCoV) antigen demonstrated positive staining in dermal macrophages providing an antemortem diagnosis of a moderate, nodular to diffuse, pyogranulomatous perivascular dermatitis due to FIP infection. Obtaining an antemortem diagnosis of FIP can be a challenge and cutaneous lesions are rare in the disease. Recognition and biopsy of any cutaneous lesions in cats with panuveitis and suspected FIP can help establish an antemortem diagnosis of the disease.
f4e9391c86c0d3844ce80af79bdca81f80883412	Classical swine fever (CSF) caused by the CSF virus (CSFV) is one of the most important swine diseases, resulting in huge economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Systematic vaccination is one of the most effective strategies for the prevention and control of this disease. Two main CSFV vaccines, the modified live vaccine (MLV) and the subunit E2 vaccine, are recommended. In Taiwan, CSF cases have not been reported since 2006, although systemic vaccination has been practiced for 70 years. Here, we examined the sero-dynamics of the piglets born from sows that received either the CSFV MLV or the E2 vaccine and investigated in the field the correlation between the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) loads and levels of CSFV antibody. A total of 1398 serum samples from 42 PRRSV-positive farms were evaluated to determine the PRRSV loads by real-time PCR and to detect CSFV antibody levels by commercial ELISA. Upon comparing the two sow vaccination protocols (CSFV MLV vaccination at 4 weeks post-farrowing versus E2 vaccination at 4-5 weeks pre-farrowing), the lowest levels of CSFV antibody were found in piglets at 5-8 and 9-12 weeks of age for the MLV and E2 groups, respectively. Meanwhile, the appropriate time window for CSFV vaccination of offspring was at 5-8 and 9-12 weeks of age in the MLV and E2 groups, respectively. There was a very highly significant negative correlation between the PRRSV load and the level of CSFV antibody in the CSFV MLV vaccination group (P < 0.0001). The PRRSV detection rate in the pigs from the MLV group (27.78%) was significantly higher than that in pigs from the E2 group (21.32%) (P = 0.011). In addition, there was a significant difference (P = 0.019) in the PRRSV detection rate at 5-8 weeks of age between the MLV (42.15%) and E2 groups (29.79%). Our findings indicate that the vaccination of CSFV MLV in piglets during the PRRSV susceptibility period at 5-8 weeks of age may be overloading the piglet's immune system and should be a critical concern for industrial pork production in the field.
f6597f5e22e2d2abb997d85cdca13e656aa30372	Feed has been identified as a vector of transmission for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The objective of this study was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize PEDV cross-contamination. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-free swine feed was manufactured to represent the negative control. A 50 kg feed batch was mixed in a pilot scale feed mill for 5 min, sampled, then discharged for 10 min into a bucket elevator and sampled again upon exit. Next, a pathogenic PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 49.5 kg of PEDV-free feed to form the positive control. The positive control was mixed, conveyed and sampled similar to the negative control. Subsequently, 4 sequence batches (sequence 1 to 4) were formed by adding a 50 kg batch of PEDV-negative feed to the mixer after the prior batch was mixed and conveyed; all sequences were mixed, conveyed, and sampled similar to the negative and positive control batches. None of the equipment was cleaned between batches within a replicate. This entire process was replicated 3 times with cleaning the feed mill between replicates. Feed was then analyzed for PEDV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) and for infectivity by bioassay. Sequence 1 feed had higher (P ˂ 0.05) rRT-PCR Ct values than the positive batch and sequence 2 feed had higher (P ˂ 0.05) Ct values than sequence 1, regardless of sampled location. Feed sampled from the mixer from sequence 2, 3, and 4 was rRT-PCR negative whereas feed sampled from the bucket elevator was rRT-PCR negative from sequence 3 and 4. Bioassay was conducted using 66 mixed sex 10-d-old pigs confirmed negative for PEDV allocated to 22 different rooms. Pigs were initially 10-d old. Control pigs remained PEDV negative for the study. All pigs from the mixer positive batch (9/9) and bucket elevator positive batch (3/3) were rRT-PCR positive on fecal swabs by the end of the study. One replicate of pigs from mixer sequence 1 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi. One replicate of mixer pigs from sequence 2 was rRT-PCR positive (3/3) by 7 dpi although no detectable PEDV RNA was found in the feed. The results demonstrate sequenced batches had reduced quantities of PEDV RNA although sequenced feed without detectible PEDV RNA by rRT-PCR can be infectious. Therefore, a sequencing protocol can reduce but not eliminate the risk of producing infectious PEDV carryover from the first sequenced batch of feed.
f508f5a7c736788eb798ee76553b33b887882e63	Type I interferons (IFNs) are essential to the clearance of viral diseases, however, a clear distinction between genes upregulated by direct virus-cell interactions and genes upregulated by secondary IFN production has not been made. Here, we investigated differential gene regulation in ferrets upon subcutaneous administration of IFN-α2b and during SARS-CoV infection. In vivo experiments revealed that IFN-α2b causes STAT1 phosphorylation and upregulation of abundant IFN response genes (IRGs), chemokine receptors, and other genes that participate in phagocytosis and leukocyte transendothelial migration. During infection with SARS-CoV not only a variety of IRGs were upregulated, but also a significantly broader range of genes involved in cell migration and inflammation. This work allowed dissection of several molecular signatures present during SARS-CoV which are part of a robust IFN antiviral response. These signatures can be useful markers to evaluate the status of IFN responses during a viral infection and specific features of different viruses.
0fe1d0b761c157b5dc9b773123d7cdfb29ac7792	This paper presents an exploratory approach for the governance of Society in the context of Smarter Life. By answering the challenges of the era of Digitalisation, facing profound societal changes, benefiting from multiple innovations, information systems and services play an outstanding role in improving and enhancing life of humans and contribute to the progress in Smarter Life. This exploratory approach is based on information, whilst information systems and services contribute to developing new practices, creating new situations, generating new added value. In this perspective, information and knowledge can be viewed as information common good, which is in the heart of service design. It is essential that services are designed in an exploratory way, by involving multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, even multi-national actors, whose active participation would lead to the development of new value-added services. This can be done thanks to a protected place adapted to co-construction of information services, Tiers-Lieu for Services (TLS). To assist the dynamics of the servitised Society and support its governing in a sustainable way, an institutional instrument, called people-public-private-partnerships for services (4PS), is presented.

e264af5a579218b8fb75b0848c49f2adc57c6bc5	Currently there is no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which frequently leads to fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury. Here, we discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated inflammation. We also assume that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses. Potential therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2 -induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.
dddccf91be0bed6a4aa950d2cb6484cd8c2d30e0	Let D d be the class of d-degenerate graphs and let L be a list assignment for a graph G. A colouring of G such that every vertex receives a colour from its list and the subgraph induced by vertices coloured with one color is a d-degenerate graph is called the (L, D d )colouring of G. For a k-uniform list assignment L and d ∈ N0, a graph G is equitably (L, D d )-colorable if there is an (L, D d )-colouring of G such that the size of any colour class does not exceed |V (G)|/k . An equitable (L, D d )-colouring is a generalization of an equitable list coloring, introduced by Kostochka et al., and an equitable list arboricity presented by Zhang. Such a model can be useful in the network decomposition where some structural properties on subnets are imposed. In this paper we give a polynomial-time algorithm that for a given (k, d)-partition of G with a t-uniform list assignment L and t ≥ k, returns its equitable (L, D d−1 )colouring. In addition, we show that 3-dimensional grids are equitably (L, D1)-colorable for any t-uniform list assignment L where t ≥ 3.

They are widely used as models of human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which immune mechanisms are thought to participate in the development of lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). The effects of MHV infection on target cell functions in the CNS are not well understood, but A59 has been shown to induce the expression of MHC class I molecules in glial cells after in vivo and in vitro infection. Changes in class I expression in infected cells may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of MHV infection in the CNS. In this communication, a large panel of MHV strains was tested for their ability to stimulate class I expression in primary astrocytes in vitro. The data show that the more hepatotropic strains, such as MHV-A59, MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, MHV-D, MHV-K, and MHV-NuU, were potent inducers of class I expression in astrocytes during acute infection, measured by radioimmunoassay. The K b molecule was preferentially expressed over D b. By contrast, JHMV and several viral strains derived from it did not stimulate the expression of class I molecules. Assays of virus infectivity indicated that the class I-inducing activity did not correlate with the ability of the individual viral strain to replicate in astrocytes. However, exposure of the viruses or the supernatants from infected astrocytes to ultraviolet light abolished the class I-inducing activity, indicating that infectious virus is required for class I expression. These data also suggest that class I expression was induced directly by virus infection, and not by the secretion of a soluble substance into the medium by infected astrocytes. Finally, analyses of A59/JHMV recombinant viral strains suggest that class I-inducing activity resides in one of the A59 structural genes. J. Exp. Med. 9 The Rockefeller University Press

c9df58c92109a1057c10b24867cb3566ffb46408	Experiments almost 20 years ago demonstrated that injections of a sequence of DNA encoding part of a pathogen could stimulate immunity. It was soon realized that "DNA vaccination" had numerous potential advantages over conventional vaccine approaches including inherent safety and a more rapid production time. These and other attributes make DNA vaccines ideal for development against emerging pathogens. Recent advances in optimizing various aspects of DNA vaccination have accelerated this approach from concept to reality in contemporary human trials. Although not yet licensed for human use, several DNA vaccines have now been approved for animal health indications. The rapid manufacturing capabilities of DNA vaccines may be particularly important for emerging infectious diseases including the current novel H1N1 Influenza A pandemic, where preexisting immunity is limited. Because of recent advances in DNA vaccination, this approach has the potential to be a powerful new weapon in protecting against emerging and potentially pandemic human pathogens.
acb0e11e5763dbf7588ec435751a2ab705a783f1	Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARSlike bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.
acaf2f7b3ae9cc5687b869e3c9e01fb5d541bf77	Effective, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic reagents are of paramount importance for combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at the time there is no preventive vaccine nor specific drug available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It would be an absolute tragedy if currently used diagnostic reagents are undermined in any manner. Based on the genotyping of 7818 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples collected up to May 1, 2020, we reveal that essentially all of the current COVID-19 diagnostic targets have had mutations. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most devastating mutations on the targets of various nucleocapsid (N) gene primers and probes, which have been unfortunately used by countries around the world to diagnose COVID-19. Our findings explain what has seriously gone wrong with a specific diagnostic reagent made in China. To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation ratio and mutation h-index of all SARS-CoV genes, indicating that the N gene is the most non-conservative gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings enable researchers to target the most conservative SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins for the design and development of COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines. * Address correspondences to Changchuan Yin.
2ab27ef3b962d32447ac0c528e7dc2da69ccd9bd	The multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was applied to detect the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) specific target cDNA fragments in the present study. The target cDNA fragments of SARS-CoV were synthesized artificially according to the genome sequence of SARS-CoV in GenBank submitted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and were used as simulated positive samples. Five primers recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) were used to amplify the fragments by single PCR and multiplex PCR. Three target cDNA fragments (121, 182 and 302 bp), as well as the three different combinations of any two of these fragments, were amplified by single PCR. The combination of these three fragments was amplified by multiplex PCR. The results indicated that the multiplex PCR technique could be applied to detect the SARS-CoV specific target cDNA fragments successfully.
cbada6c16e74f3dda02b4572f30520e733972c1d	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been responsible for several recent outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and has caused great economic loss in the swine-raising industry. Considering the significance of PEDV, a systemic analysis was performed to study its codon usage patterns. The relative synonymous codon usage value of each codon revealed that codon usage bias exists and that PEDV tends to use codons that end in T. The mean ENC value of 47.91 indicates that the codon usage bias is low. However, we still wanted to identify the cause of this codon usage bias. A correlation analysis between the codon compositions (A3s, T3s, G3s, C3s, and GC3s), the ENC values, and the nucleotide contents (A%, T%, G%, C%, and GC%) indicated that mutational bias plays role in shaping the PEDV codon usage bias. This was further confirmed by a principal component analysis between the codon compositions and the axis values. Using the Gravy, Aroma, and CAI values, a role of natural selection in the PEDV codon usage pattern was also identified. Neutral analysis indicated that natural selection pressure plays a more important role than mutational bias in codon usage bias. Natural selection also plays an increasingly significant role during PEDV evolution. Additionally, gene function and geographic distribution also influence the codon usage bias to a degree.
9982f404763c1e3174fb0bdf5fc261594fc7ed8e	Multiple laboratory developed tests and commercially available assays have emerged to meet 15 diagnostic needs related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To date, there is limited comparison 16 data for these different testing platforms. We compared the analytical performance of a 17 laboratory developed test (LDT) developed in our clinical laboratory based on CDC primer sets 18 and four commercially available, FDA emergency use authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2 19 (Cepheid, DiaSorin, Hologic Panther, and Roche Cobas) on a total of 169 nasopharyngeal swabs. 20 The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-21 CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens. The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa, 22 and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of 23 our CDC-based LDT assay. All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold 24 standard. Our results provide initial test performance characteristics for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 25 and highlight the importance of having multiple viral detection testing platforms available in a 26 public health emergency.
082f41db636ee3891dcf479c53d4167d51445b65	Background: Mothers of moderately to severely affected children with cerebral palsy (CP) have to spend a long time to take care of their children. This time-consuming responsibility affects their physical and psychosocial health. Therefore, mothers as caregivers are required to receive special training to take care of their children. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a developed web-based intervention for daily care training of children with CP on their mothers' quality of life (QOL), anxiety, depression, stress, and their musculoskeletal pain. Methods and procedures: This study was a single blind randomized controlled trial. 91 mothers of children with CP with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III, IѴ, and Ѵ, who aged from 4 to 12 years were assigned to the intervention and control groups using block randomization. Mothers in the control group received their routine face to face occupational therapy intervention and mothers in the intervention group received 12 weeks web-based intervention. QOL, depression, anxiety, stress, and pain were measured before and after the intervention in both groups. Outcomes and results: The results of analysis of covariance showed that after controlling the mean score of pretest of pain, the mean score of post-tests in the intervention and control groups was significantly different (P < 0.05). The mean scores of physical health and total QOL scores of post-tests in the intervention group were significantly higher than the control group with controlling pretest scores. Conclusions and implications: Designed web-based intervention affects the caregivers' QOL and pain significantly. This intervention can be used to provide daily care training for mothers of children with CP.
cbd52a7ac49b4c1ae4f0f087b77b91a0655d9027	We study the reported data from the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in January -May 2020 in 119 countries. We observe that the time series of active cases in individual countries (the difference of the total number of confirmed infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered cases) display a strong agreement with polynomial growth and at a later epidemic stage also with a combined polynomial growth with exponential decay. Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number R 0 as T M /t, where T M is a constant and t is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic data and estimate some epidemic paramters. Note that although the model shows a good agreement with the reported data we do not make any claims about the real size of the pandemics as the relation of the observed reported data to the total number of infected in the population is still unknown.
4b9d87001b5c14cd1388a57dae583d2207823075	In this paper we take up three terms -containment, delay, mitigation -that have been used by the UK Government to describe their phased response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the terms refer to a political and public health strategy -contain the virus, flatten the peak of the epidemic, mitigate its effects -we offer a psychosocial reading that draws attention to the relation between time and care embedded in each term. We do so to call for the development of a form of care-ful attention under conditions that tend to prompt action rather than reflection, closing down time for thinking. Using Adriana notion of 'horrorism', in which violence is enacted Cavarero's at precisely the point that care is most needed, we discuss the ever-present possibility of failures acts of care. We argue that dwelling in the within temporality of delay can be understood as an act of care if delaying allows us to pay care-ful attention to violence. We then circle back to a point in twentieth-century history -World War II -that was also concerned with an existential threat requiring a response from a whole population. Our purpose is not to invoke a fantasised narrative of 'Blitz spirit', but to suggest that the British psychoanalytic tradition born of that moment offers resources for understanding how to keep thinking while 'under fire' through containing unbearable anxiety and the capacity for violence in the intersubjective space and time between people. In conditions of lockdown and what will be a long and drawn-out 'after life' of COVID-19, this commitment to thinking in and with delay and containment might help to inhabit this time of waiting -waiting that is the management and mitigation of a future threat, but also a time of care in and for the present.
47a9f294822514b5a4ebfea8f18cdfcd326f2f48	Because outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) might reemerge, identifying antiviral compounds is of key importance. Previously, we showed that the cellular factor TNF-␣ converting enzyme (TACE), activated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S protein), was positively involved in viral entry, implying that TACE is a possible target for developing antiviral compounds. To demonstrate this possibility, we here tested the effects of TACE inhibitors on viral entry. In vitro and in vivo data revealed that the TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 attenuated entry of both pseudotyped virus expressing the SARS-S protein in a lentiviral vector backbone and infectious SARS-CoV. TAPI-2 blocked both the SARS-S protein-induced shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV, and TNF-␣ production in lung tissues. Since the downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-S protein was proposed as an etiological event in the severe clinical manifestations, our data suggest that TACE antagonists block SARS-CoV infection and also attenuate its severe clinical outcome.
526625cf5000ab29d70641c70564d1f49b42946a	The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused large outbreaks around the world and every heavily affected community has experienced a substantial strain on the health care system and a high death toll. Communities therefore have to monitor the incidence of COVID-19 carefully and attempt to project the demand for health care. To enable such projections, we have developed an interactive web application that simulates an age-structured SEIR model with separate compartments for severely and critically ill patients. The tool allows the users to modify most parameters of the model, including age specific assumptions on severity. Infection control and mitigation measures that reduce transmission can be specified, as well as age-group specific isolation. The simulation of the model runs entirely on the client side in the browser; all parameter settings and results of the simulation can be exported for further downstream analysis. The tool is available at covid19-scenarios.org and the source code at github.com
1ef1ae062aaf0d8a4f8cae27e51cf82cbbf88486	 The future of sustainable healthcare is built on distributed system in which stakeholders are organised into structured dynamic networks;  Cross-sectoral forums are needed to organise and facilitate collaborations and crossfertilisation within the value chain and in synergy with other sectors;  A change in the role of policy-makers and policy instruments is needed to promote radical innovations that can accelerate the transition to sustainable healthcare;  Awareness-raising and knowledge-building strategies are crucial to boost the sustainable transitions of healthcare systems at the international level. Over the past years, the interest in sustainable healthcare has been growing globally and the transition toward environmentally, economically and socially viable health systems is perceived as inevitable and necessary. All the approaches to this emerging field are mainly focusing on short-term specific issues and involving a limited number of stakeholders. This study aimed to address the topic of the possible futures of sustainable healthcare from a multi-stakeholder perspective, in order to define a long-term scenario and the key strategies to enhance this transition. A series of workshops have involved a representative selection of stakeholders based in Nordic countries and concerned with sustainable healthcare (health industries, health providers, managing authorities, universities and research centres, clusters, NGOs and healthcare networks, professional consortia) through a collaborative foresight process. A design-based approach has been adopted to investigate the current scenario and deepen foresight outcomes. The results highlighted three different horizons and the drivers to reshape the roles of individual stakeholders, enhancing the socio-technical transition towards a desirable scenario based on collaboration between distributed dynamic networks. The identified transition strategies move from the local to the international level, focusing on innovation, information and collaboration between stakeholders. This study provides the framework for future studies to deepen the transition process towards sustainable healthcare and its implications at Nordics, European and international levels. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 with massive budget deficits in public spending. This is leading to merging individual hospitals to increase cost-efficiency and exploit economies of scale while offering broader service (Deloitte, 2016). New technologies play a key role in this new trend by optimising treatments procedures and enhancing the digital connection between hospitals and physicians. The need for keeping health costs down is also leading to increased transparency into care quality, results, and expenditure, due to mandatory or voluntary monitoring. Secondly, healthcare has to face new health needs and find new and efficient ways to meet them. The population is ageing quickly, and by 2050 the number of persons over 60 years is expected to double, from 901 million to nearly 2.1 billion (United Nations, 2017). Population ageing puts pressure on health systems, increasing the demand for care, services, and technologies to prevent and treat noncommunicable diseases and chronic conditions associated with old age. Overall, there is a shift toward chronic care: chronic noncommunicable diseases are responsible for 68% of world's deaths (WHO, 2014) and account for over 70% of healthcare spending in the US and European Union (Gerteis et al., 2014; Busse et al., 2010) . Overall, the healthcare sector plays a significant economic role, by accounting, in the European Union, for 10% of GDP and 8% of the total workforce. Public expenditure on healthcare and long-term care is expected to increase, driven by high levels of public expenditure and debt in most countries, demographic pressures and technological advances. Today, "the need to make health systems sustainable by making them more effective, accessible and resilient has been duly recognised by policy-makers at the EU and national level" (European Commission, 2016) and in the near future, policy actions will be needed to ensure longterm population health and care systems. This attention to regulations, policies and management practices of healthcare does not concern only Europe. Healthcare systems worldwide need to respond to these challenges, and healthcare stakeholders need to cooperate to face these new societal needs and move towards more sustainable systems. Expenses and patient numbers will inevitably increase, and healthcare must pursue the goal of becoming more effective, more efficient, and more equitable for all people, by controlling spending, improving and implementing the use of available technology and engaging patients in prevention and self-care. The transition toward more resilient health systems is both delicate and complex, and it needs radical changes of perspective as regards the patients' role and the systemic and multidisciplinary approach to healthcare.

e92586dac17e70d0e9c09d007cd33867795c4457	Expatriates comprise a diverse set of travelers who face unique medical, psychiatric, and non-healthrelated risks as a result of increased exposure to host country environment and associated lifestyle. Expatriates have an increased risk of developing malaria, gastrointestinal disorders, latent tuberculosis, vaccine-preventable infections, and psychological disorders, when compared with other travelers, yet the majority of existing pretravel guidelines have been designed to suit the needs of nonexpatriates. Although greater interest in expatriate health issues has led to improved characterization of illness in this population, expatriate-specific risk mitigation strategies-including modifications to chemoprophylaxis recommendations, limiting tuberculosis exposure, and prevention of occupational or sexual blood-borne virus transmission-are poorly described. Occupations and destinations affect travel-related disease risk and should inform the pretravel consultation.

We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a cindex of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, All rights reserved.

Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes the potentially lethal Covid-19 respiratory tract infection. It does so by binding to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, leading to endocytosis with the receptor, and subsequently using the host cell's machinery to replicate copies of itself and invade new cells. The extent of the spread of infection in the body is dependent on the pattern of ACE2 expression and overreaction of the immune system. Additionally, by inducing an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the loss of ACE2 would favour the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes in the lungs. No drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses. Hundreds of clinical trials on existing approved drugs from different classes acting on a multitude of targets in the virus life cycle are ongoing to examine potential effectiveness for the prevention and treatment of the infection. This review summarizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus life cycle in the host cell and provides a biological and pathological point of view for repurposed and experimental drugs for this novel coronavirus. The viral lifecycle provides potential targets for drug therapy.
c6e3d75b88af31d669a4277ca72adee48a96a3ae	Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), a human parvovirus, belongs to the genus Bocavirus of the Parvoviridae family. It causes wheezing in young children with acute respiratory tract infections. HBoV1 has been shown to infect polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) made in house, and induces airway epithelial damage. In this study, two commercially available HAE cultures, EpiAirway and MucilAir HAE, were examined for HBoV1 infection. Both HAE cultures support fully productive HBoV1 infection. Infected EpiAirway and MucilAir HAE cultures showed loss of cilia, disruption of the tight junction barrier, and a significant decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance. Notably, HBoV1 persistent infection was demonstrated by maintaining HBoV1-infected EpiAirway HAE for as long as 50 days. After 2 days postinfection, progeny virus was produced consistently daily at a level of over 2 × 10 8 viral genome copies per culture (0.6 cm 2 ). This study is the first to use commercial sources of HAE cultures for HBoV1 infection. The availability of these cultures will enable a wide range of laboratories to study HBoV1 infection.

However, its use is still limited due to scaling issues. One way to address this is to exploit the large amounts of symmetry present in many real world designs. In this paper, we adapt partial order reduction for bounded model checking of synchronous hardware and introduce a novel technique that makes partial order reduction practical in this new domain. These approaches are largely automatic, requiring only minimal manual effort. We evaluate our technique on open-source and commercial packet mover circuitsdesigns containing FIFOs and arbiters.
40afe56736a9733a103c22570b574165d7d38edd	The type I interferon system plays a critical role in limiting the spread of viral infection. Viruses induce the production of interferon (IFN), which after binding to the IFN- receptor (IFNAR), and triggering of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade, results in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs function to inhibit viral replication and to regulate the host immune response. Among these ISGs, the ubiquitin-like molecule, ISG15, is one of the most strongly induced proteins. Similar to ubiquitin, through an IFN induced conjugation cascade, ISG15 is covalently linked to a variety of cellular proteins, suggesting regulation of different cellular processes. Studies performed over the past several years have shown that ISG15 plays a central role in the host's antiviral response against many viruses. Mice lacking ISG15 display increased susceptibility to multiple viruses. Furthermore, several viruses have developed immune evasion strategies that directly target the ISG15 pathway. Work is now underway to determine the mechanism by which ISG15 functions as an antiviral molecule, such that therapies targeting this pathway can be developed in the future. Keywords: ISG15; interferon; antiviral; ubiquitin-like molecule 1. Introduction-The ISG15 Pathway ISG15 was first noted in type I interferon(IFN; IFN-, -β) treated cell lysates in 1984 and was soon after identified as having sequence homology to ubiquitin (reviewed in reference [1]) [2,3]. The crystal structure of ISG15 revealed that it is composed of two domains, each of which assumes a β-grasp fold OPEN ACCESS Viruses 2010, 2 2155 similar to the ubiquitin structure [2] . ISG15 is one of the most abundantly-induced transcripts upon type I IFN treatment, as well as following TLR ligation and viral infection [3, 4] . It is synthesized as a 17 kDa precursor protein that is proteolytically processed into its mature 15 kDa form [3] . Following stimulation with type I IFN, ISG15 exists in three distinct states-free within the cell, released into the extracellular space, or conjugated to target proteins. Early after its identification, ISG15 was reported to be found in an extracellular form. Stimulation of human monocytes with type I IFN resulted in as much as 50% of the accumulated ISG15 being released into the media [5] . Furthermore, the repeated treatment of patients with interferon-β ser resulted in detectable levels of ISG15 in their sera within 48 hours of treatment [5] . ISG15 doesn't contain a signal sequence; therefore, the mechanism by which it is released remains unknown. Several immunomodulatory activities have been attributed to recombinant or extracellular ISG15 including its ability to induce NK cell proliferation, augment lymphokine-activated-killer (LAK) activity, stimulate the production of IFN-γ, induce DC maturation, and to function as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils [6] [7] [8] . To date no cell surface receptor has been identified that binds to ISG15; therefore the role that its potential cytokine activity plays in vivo is yet to be ascertained. Similar to ubiquitin, the mature form of ISG15 contains a C-terminal LRLRGG motif that mediates its covalent conjugation to target proteins, termed ISGylation [9,10]. Within two hours after type I IFN treatment, free ISG15 is detectable in cell lysates, followed by conjugate formation 12-16 hours later [9] . ISGylation utilizes a mechanism similar to ubiquitin, requiring three enzymatic steps (Figure 1 ). The activating E1 enzyme, Ube1L, was initially identified by Robert Krug and colleagues and functions only in the ISG15 pathway, forming an ATP-dependent thioester bond with ISG15 [11]. The recent generation of an UbE1L knockout mouse has confirmed its role as the ISG15 E1. These mice express free ISG15, but do not form ISG15 conjugates following LPS stimulation or during viral infection [12] . Following activation, ISG15 is transferred to the active-site cysteine of the conjugating E2 enzyme UbcM8/UbcH8 [13, 14] . This is followed by the transfer of ISG15 to lysine residues on target proteins by the E3 ligases. To date, three E3 ligases have been shown to interact with the ISG15 pathway and include human HERC5 (Ceb1)/mouse HERC6, HHARI,. ISGylation is reversible due to specific removal of ISG15 from conjugated proteins by the deconjugating enzyme Ubp43 (USP18) [21, 22] . A screen for additional deubiquitinating enzymes that could target ISG15 conjugates identified USP2, USP5, USP13, and USP14 as potential candidates, whose significance remain to be determined in vivo [23] . While in many ways the ISG15 pathway parallels the ubiquitin conjugation pathway, there are differences that exist. First, all members of the ISG15 conjugation cascade are upregulated by type I IFNs. Second, unlike ubiquitin, in which hundreds of E3s are responsible for the individual substrate specificity, in the ISG15 pathway, Herc5 appears to be a dominant E3 ligase that coordinates the conjugation of the majority of substrates to ISG15. The inhibition of Herc5 expression with siRNA abrogated greater than 90% of the ISG15 conjugate formation that was induced [15] . A recent study by Durfee and colleagues has shown the Herc5 associates with polyribosomes and appears to target newly synthesized proteins, including viral proteins, for modification by ISG15, helping to explain the broad substrate specificity of Herc5 [24] .
d766800615c954b08127dd8d8052b523b3c9075b	Objectives: Prolonged survival of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on environmental surfaces and personal protective equipment may lead to these surfaces transmitting this pathogen to others. We sought to determine the effectiveness of a pulsedxenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection system in reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. Methods: Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and were exposed to different durations of PX-UV.

d1fc5729ff932800c93dbe279b36ea3c53375708	Chlamydophila psittaci is found worldwide, but is particularly common among psittacine birds in tropical and subtropical regions. While investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in Hong Kong, we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots, which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals. The novel adenovirus (tentatively named Psittacine adenovirus HKU1) was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A in the Atadenovirus genus. Sequencing showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome consists of 31,735 nucleotides. Comparative genome analysis showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome contains 23 open reading frames (ORFs) with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes, and six additional ORFs at the 39 end of the genome. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from other viruses in the Atadenovirus genus. Notably, fiber-2 protein, which is present in Aviadenovirus but not Atadenovirus, is also present in Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50.3-54.0% for the DNA polymerase, 64.6-70.7% for the penton protein, and 66.1-74.0% for the hexon protein with other Atadenovirus. The C. psittaci bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung. Immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots, confirming active viral replication. No other viruses were found. This is the first documentation of an adenovirus-C. psittaci co-infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis. Viral-bacterial co-infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. The role of viral-bacterial co-infection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals.

00624a8e79f31fccd9cc02ac643e8481d78898af	A new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO), has rapidly spread around the world since its first reported case in late December of 2019 from Wuhan, China. As of mid-April 2020, this virus has affected more than 180 countries and territories, infecting more than 1,650,000 individuals and causing over 100.000 deaths. With ≈20 million new cases per year globally, cancer affects a significant portion of the population. Individuals affected by cancer are more susceptible to infections due to coexisting chronic diseases (cardiovascular, pulmonary and diabetes), overall poor health status, and systemic immunosuppressive states caused by both cancer and anticancer treatments. As a consequence, patients with malignancies, and especially with lung cancer who develop COVID19 experience more difficult outcomes. A recent multicenter study developed by the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association also documented that lung cancer patients had an increased risk of death, ICU requirement, risk of presenting severe or critical symptoms, and use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Here we present two representative cases of patients with lung cancer and COVID19 without respiratory compromise and with atypical and severe skin manifestations, findings that could be influenced by the chronic use of anti-PD1 antibodies.

67ef4b8a1eaaf14328ad66f28e0f103c608e73d4	Background: Cells of the innate immune system including monocytes and macrophages are the first line of defence against infections and are critical regulators of the inflammatory response. These cells express toll-like receptors (TLRs), innate immune receptors which govern tailored inflammatory gene expression patterns. Monocytes, which produce proinflammatory mediators, are readily recruited to the central nervous system (CNS) in neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: This study explored the expression of receptors (CD11b, TLR2 and TLR4) on circulating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy elderly adults who we classified as either IQ memory-consistent (high-performing, HP) or IQ memory-discrepant (low-performing, LP). The expression of CD11b, TLR4 and TLR2 was increased in MDMs from the LP group when compared to HP cohort. MDMs from both groups responded robustly to treatment with the TLR4 activator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in terms of cytokine production. Significantly, MDMs from the LP group displayed hypersensitivity to LPS exposure. Interpretation: Overall these findings define differential receptor expression and cytokine profiles that occur in MDMs derived from a cohort of IQ memory-discrepant individuals. These changes are indicative of inflammation and may be involved in the prodromal processes leading to the development of neurodegenerative disease.
12c3660c37af4a311a3a14667a12ce48388dd6ce	Under a traditional paradigm, only those with the expected background knowledge consume academic literature. The lay press, as well as government and non-government agencies, play a complementary role of extracting findings of high interest or importance and translating them for general viewing. The need for accurate reporting and public advising is paramount when attempting to tackle epidemic outbreaks through behavior change. Yet, public trust in media outlets is at a historic low. The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model for media reporting on public health emergencies was established in 2005 and has subsequently been used to analyze media reporting on outbreaks of influenza and measles as well as smoking habits and medication compliance. However, no media analysis had yet been performed on the 2013-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. This study compared the EVD information relayed by lay press sources with general review articles in the academic literature through a mixed-methods analysis. These findings suggest that comprehensive review articles could not serve as a source to clarify and contextualize the uncertainties around the EVD outbreak, perhaps due to adherence to technical accuracy at the expense of clarity within the context of outbreak conditions. This finding does not imply inferiority of the academic literature, nor does it draw direct causation between confusion in review articles and public misunderstanding. Given the erosion of the barriers siloing academia, combined with the demands of today's fast-paced media environment, contemporary researchers should realize that no study is outside the public forum and to therefore consider shifting the paradigm to take personal responsibility in the process of accurately translating their scientific words into public policy actions to best serve as a source of clarity.
b8fca462b03b64506e340702f1d6aee6d7ebebe3	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is a serious global concern. Increased morbidity and mortality is associated with older age, male gender, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and smoking. As COVID-19 spreads from coastal borders, both state to state and country to country, our understanding of its pathophysiology has evolved. Age and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) play especially important roles in COVID-19 progression. T2DM is an age-related disease associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and endothelial activation and dysfunction. This review evaluates the relationships and intersection between endothelial cell activation and dysfunction in T2DM and COVID-19.
24da9eb1bf5b54581deda2e999cd5058674ceac4	The bacterium Tropheryma whipplei, which causes Whipple disease in humans, is commonly detected in the feces of persons in Africa. It is also associated with acute infections. We investigated the role of T. whipplei in febrile patients from 2 rural villages in Senegal. During June 2010-March 2012, we collected whole-blood finger-prick samples from 786 febrile and 385 healthy villagers. T. whipplei was detected in blood specimens from 36 (4.6%) of the 786 febrile patients and in 1 (0.25%) of the 385 apparently healthy persons. Of the 37 T. whipplei cases, 26 (70.2%) were detected in August 2010. Familial cases and a potential new genotype were observed. The patients' symptoms were mainly headache (68.9%) and cough (36.1%). Our findings suggest that T. whipplei is a cause of epidemic fever in Senegal.

7922f53c4ceea984759e03d03a58b6379a847599	Functional networks are a powerful extension of neural networks where the scalar weights are replaced by neural functions. This paper concerns the problem of parametric learning of the associative model, a functional network that represents the associativity operator. This problem can be formulated as a nonlinear continuous least-squares minimization problem, solved by applying a swarm intelligence approach based on a modified memetic self-adaptive version of the firefly algorithm. The performance of our approach is discussed through an illustrative example. It shows that our method can be successfully applied to solve the parametric learning of functional networks with unknown functions.
82622008a09f2efba2ee6caa2629b3622f3efb8b	The present study included 658 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Forty-two (6.4%) out of 658 patients presented with ketosis on admission with no obvious fever or diarrhoea. They had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 47.0 (38.0-70.3) years, and 16 (38.1%) were men. Patients with ketosis were younger (median age 47.0 vs. 58.0 years; P = 0.003) and had a greater prevalence of fatigue (31.0% vs. 10.6%; P < 0.001), diabetes (35.7% vs. 18.5%; P = 0.007) and digestive disorders (31.0% vs. 12.0%; P < 0.001). They had a longer median (IQR) length of hospital stay (19.0 [12.8-33.3] vs. 16.0 [10.0-24.0] days; P < 0.001) and a higher mortality rate (21.4% vs. 8.9%; P = 0.017). Three (20.0%) out of the 15 patients with diabetic ketosis developed acidosis, five patients (26.7%) with diabetic ketosis died, and one of these (25.0%) presented with acidosis. Two (7.4%) and four (14.3%) of the 27 non-diabetic ketotic patients developed severe acidosis and died, respectively, and one (25.0%) of these presented with acidosis. This suggests that COVID-19 infection caused ketosis or ketoacidosis, and induced diabetic ketoacidosis for those with diabetes. Ketosis increased the length of hospital stay and mortality. Meanwhile, diabetes increased the length of hospital stay for patients with ketosis but had no effect on their mortality.
5ea003777403bda990fe5a2471273b477e529751	This experiment was conducted to evaluate whether pretreatment with fenofibrate could mitigate acute lung injury (ALI) in a mice model of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 6): sham, intestinal I/R + vehicle, and intestinal I/R + fenofibrate. Intestinal I/R was achieved by clamping the superior mesenteric artery. Fenofibrate (100 mg/kg) or equal volume of vehicle was injected intraperitoneally 60 minutes before the ischemia. At the end of experiment, measurement of pathohistological score, inflammatory mediators and other markers were performed. In addition, a 24-hour survival experiment was conducted in intestinal I/R mice treated with fenofibrate or vehicle. The chief results were as anticipated. Pathohistological evaluation indicated that fenofibrate ameliorated the local intestine damage and distant lung injury. Pretreatment with fenofibrate significantly decreased inflammatory factors in both the intestine and the lung. Consistently, renal creatine levels and hepatic ALT levels were significantly decreased in the fenofibrate group. Moreover, serum systemic inflammatory response indicators were significantly alleviated in the fenofibrate group. In addition, fenofibrate administration significantly improved the survival rate. Collectively, our data indicated that pretreatment with fenofibrate prior to ischemia attenuated intestinal I/R injury and ALI. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critically severe, life-threatening condition in ICU, characterized by high mortality of approximately 40% 1 . ALI, along with its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome, often results from a massive insult to the lung, whether be the direct alveolar infiltration or the indirect effects of systemic inflammatory response syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndromes 2 . An effective treatment of this life-threatening disorder calls for a better understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of ALI. The intestine is recognized to be one of the largest immune barrier systems and to be the source of bacteria and endotoxins in the body 3 . Previous reports indicate that the intestinal organ plays a crucial role in the development of ALI 4 . Mesenteric artery ischemia, a commonly seen critical state during small bowel transplantation or trauma, may lead to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. During the process of intestinal I/R injury, local bacteria overgrow and translocate, gastrointestinal mobility decreases, and mucosal permeability increases, all of which subsequently lead to the local intestine damage or distant lung injuries through the activation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndromes 5,6 . Intestinal I/R is, therefore, a useful model for the investigation of pathophysiological mechanism of indirect ALI. Fenofibrate is known as an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -α (PPARα ), the nuclear receptor superfamily member 7 . As a nuclear receptor activator, fenofibrate up-regulates or down-regulates genes that are involved in many pathophysiological processes, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and leukocyte endothelium interactions 8, 9 . Recent studies have demonstrated an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-ischemic role of fenofibrate to attenuate I/R injury in kidney 10,11 , liver 12 , brain 13,14 and heart 15 . But to date there are no literatures reporting the protective effects of fenofibrate in I/R injury in the organ of intestine. Moreover, the functional significance of fenofibrate in the intestinal I/R-induced ALI remains unclear. Therefore, this experiment is aimed to investigate whether fenofibrate administration would ameliorate the lung injury and inflammation in the model of intestinal I/R injury. Animals. The male C57BL/6 mice (8-10-wk-old; 20 ± 2 g) were purchased from Charles River (Beijing, China). Mice were kept in a temperature (21 ± 2 °C) and humidity (60 ± 5%) controlled room on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. They were fed a standard mice chow and water ad liblitum. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
18f7e858aa68ea383e0e3d2e0604c5919b8b8a10	Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), the aetiological agent of haemorrhagic enteritis in dogs, includes three antigenic variants, types 2a, 2b and 2c. CPV-2c has been detected initially in Italy and subsequently in Vietnam. We report the first identification of this novel antigenic variant in Spain, where it caused an outbreak of fatal enteritis in basset hound pups in association with canine coronavirus type I and type II. We suggest that this new antigenic variant of CPV-2 could spread throughout Europe and that there is a subsequent need to update current CPV vaccines. U. S.
f328ee900e91ba6c3bcc9a8f27e8fac7cd8c5eeb	Infectious bronchitis is an economically important disease with worldwide distribution. Information is available on the presence of infectious bronchitis virus in commercial chicken in parts of Ghana but there is no information on free-range poultry and guinea fowls in the country. Possible IBV infections among free-range chickens and guinea fowls in Abokobi and Frafraha communities in the Ga-East district of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana were investigated using serology and PCR. Blood, tracheal, and cloacal swabs were obtained from 219 free-range chickens and guinea fowls with no respiratory symptoms and no history of IBV vaccination. Sera were evaluated for IBV antibodies by ELISA using commercial IBV test kit from IDEXX, Inc., USA. Swab samples were evaluated for S1 glycoprotein gene by one-step RT PCR. All the swab samples tested negative for IBV. 16% of all tested sera were positive for IBV. IBV seroprevalence in guinea fowls was 0%. 21.2% of sera from local chickens were positive for IBV. The seroprevalence of IBV among local chickens from Frafraha was 30% and that of Abokobi was 7.7%. This study shows exposure of local chickens in the study communities to IBV.
2c5a8295ca8cdbb87513b2acd2cca3eed7915b81	A modified artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed for solving the scheduling optimization problem of multi-aisle automatic storage/retrieval system. The optimization model of the problem is analyzed and founded, in which the sequence constraint of tasks and calculation of the number of aisles are more realistic. According to the features of the problem, the encoding and decoding strategies for solutions to MABC algorithm are redesigned. Probability selectionbased updating method is also introduced to enhance the neighborhood search and preserve the good fragments. The experimental results show that MABC can obtain better results than PSO and GA algorithm, and is a competitive approach for AS/RS scheduling optimization.
ec4b42679b0109e43ab1ef22e2d54266486c54bd	Purpose: Indications and optimal timing for tracheostomy in traumatic brain-injured (TBI) patients are uncertain. This study aims to describe the patients' characteristics, timing, and factors related to the decision to perform a tracheostomy and differences in strategies among different countries and assess the effect of the timing of tracheostomy on patients' outcomes. We selected TBI patients from CENTER-TBI, a prospective observational longitudinal cohort study, with an intensive care unit stay ≥ 72 h. Tracheostomy was defined as early (≤ 7 days from admission) or late (> 7 days). We used a Cox regression model to identify critical factors that affected the timing of tracheostomy. The outcome was assessed at 6 months using the extended Glasgow Outcome Score. Of the 1358 included patients, 433 (31.8%) had a tracheostomy. Age (hazard rate, HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.07, p = 0.003), Glasgow coma scale ≤ 8 (HR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.22-2.36 at 7; p < 0.001), thoracic trauma (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01-1.52, p = 0.020), hypoxemia (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.05-1.79, p = 0.048), unreactive pupil (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.27-2.45 at 7; p < 0.001) were predictors for tracheostomy. Considerable heterogeneity among countries was found in tracheostomy frequency (7.9-50.2%) and timing (early 0-17.6%). Patients with a late tracheostomy were more likely to have a worse neurological outcome, i.e., mortality and poor neurological sequels (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.07-2.67, p = 0.018), and longer length of stay (LOS) (38.5 vs. 49.4 days, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Tracheostomy after TBI is routinely performed in severe neurological damaged patients. Early tracheostomy is associated with a better neurological outcome and reduced LOS, but the causality of this relationship remains unproven.
c512d6575c7d49c93eff409ba57f150edf159bfe	A number of clues point to a possible role of vitamin D in fighting COVID-19: a reduction in case growth speed with solar zenith angle, higher fatality rate in black people, lower fatality rate in populations that spend more time outdoors. Yet a direct demonstration that vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 fatalities has remained elusive. We show here in a comparison of 32 countries that countries with high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency 15 among elderly females show a confirmed case fatality rate twice as high as those with low prevalence. We then show that this effect cannot be explained by differences in life expectancy between countries. A mechanistic role for vitamin D in the severity of COVID-19 is proposed. One Sentence Summary: Vitamin D deficiency among elderly females is associated with 20 countrywide COVID-19 confirmed case fatality rates up to twice as high as those of countries with low vitamin D deficiency prevalence.
4fc6644d7e69edea8aab46db3e152a9061c99a2f	Coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged as a health problem worldwide. It seems that COVID-19 is more lethal for Iranian veterans with a history of exposure to mustard gas. There are some similarities in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and mustard gas in immune system disruption and pulmonary infection. SARS-CoV-2 and mustard gas inducing oxidative stress, immune system dysregulation, cytokine storm, and overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor in lungs that act as functional entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, Iranian survivors of mustard gas exposure are more susceptible and vulnerable to COVID-19. It is suggested that the principles of COVID-19 infection prevention and control be adhered to more stringently in Iranian survivors of mustard gas exposure than others who have not been exposed to mustard gas. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the different pathologic aspects of lung injury caused by mustard gas and also the relationship between this damage and the increased susceptibility of Iranian mustard gas exposed survivors to COVID-19.
28d9aa67c285031bfe42e26822d1af9427dcb6e9	Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pestivirus member of the Flaviviridae family, closely related to, and used as a surrogate model for the hepatitis C virus. Its envelope contains the E1 and E2 glycoproteins, disulfide linked into homo-and heterodimers. In this study, we investigate the role of disulfide bond formation in the folding, assembly, and stability of BVDV glycoproteins. We provide molecular evidence that intact disulfide bonds are critical for the acquirement of a stable conformation of E2 monomers. Forcing the E2 glycoproteins to adopt a reduced conformation either co-or post-translationally before assembly into dimers, determines their misfolding and degradation by proteasome. In contrast, dimerization of E2 glycoproteins results in a conformation resistant to reducing agents and degradation. Furthermore, inhibition of the ER-a-mannosidase activity leads to impairment of misfolded E2 degradation, demonstrating the involvement of this enzyme in targeting viral proteins towards proteasomal degradation.

03416327676e6d6ffd8e1f29ba01cb3558ce9871	To provide a foundation for the development of rapid and specific methods for the diagnosis of rabies virus infection, anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies were prepared and rabies virus nucleoprotein and human rabies virus vaccine strain (PV strain) were used as immunogens to immunize 6-8 week old female BALB/c mice. Spleen cells and SP2/0 myeloma cells were fused according to conventional methods: the monoclonal cell strains obtained were selected using the indirect immunofluorescence test; this was followed by preparation of monoclonal antibody ascitic fluid; and finally, systematic identification of subclass, specificity and sensitivity was carried out. Two high potency and specific monoclonal antibodies against rabies virus were obtained and named 3B12 and 4A12, with ascitic fluid titers of 1:8000 and 1:10000, respectively. Both belonged to the IgG2a subclass. These strains secrete potent, stable and specific anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies, which makes them well suited for the development of rabies diagnosis reagents. Monoclonal antibodies against rabies virus have been widely used in the diagnosis and immunological analysis of rabies [7, 13] . Human monoclonal antibodies to rabies G protein are also expected to be used as a replacement for rabies immune globulin(RIG) [4, 10] in the post-exposure treatment of rabies. Two techniques are recommended by WHO and used world wide. These are the gold standard fluorescent antibody (FA) technique, a rapid and sensitive method for diagnosing rabies infection in animals; and the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) for the evaluation of neutralizing antibodies of rabies virus (RV).

a5461ce95a584cf5eb9352e70ea68d14e619a41e	Introduction: The role of laboratory parameters in screening of COVID-19 cases has not been definitely established. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test. They can help in detection of COVID-19 patients.

626fd7c8ea1eb23c6160c09bdfac9864bb6196ab	Management of apartment buildings is never straightforward because of the need for collective homeowner action. Mancur Olson suggests that a rational individual will not participate in collective action which provides no positive net benefit for him or her. Based on this premise, it would seem that rationality drives homeowners to free-ride on others' efforts and that, as a result, no collective action will take place. However, some homeowners do actively participate in housing management, and it is worthwhile to examine why some participate and others do not. Building on the wide-ranging applications of the collective interest model (CIM) in explaining political participation and environmental activism, this paper expands its relevance to the arena of housing management. The explanatory analysis which is based on the findings of a structured questionnaire survey in Hong Kong corroborates the central propositions of the CIM and provides a theoretical account of housing management activism. In brief, housing management activism is a function of beliefs about personal and group efficacy, the value of the collective good, and the selective benefits and costs of participation. These findings have farreaching implications for the formulation of government policies promoting homeowners' active involvement in housing management in Hong Kong and other megacities.

d1f5250284199a6a22a59d1e75672636e8c4de12	BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but it is unknown whether prone positioning improves outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19. METHODS: A cohort study at a New York City hospital at the peak of the early pandemic in the United States, under crisis conditions. The aim was to determine the bene t of prone positioning in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included changes in physiologic parameters. Fine-Gray competing risks models with stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting (sIPTW) were used to determine the effect of prone positioning on outcomes. In addition, linear mixed effects models (LMM) were used to assess changes in physiology with prone positioning. RESULTS: Out of 335 participants who were intubated and mechanically ventilated, 62 underwent prone positioning, 199 met prone positioning criteria and served as controls and 74 were excluded. The intervention and control groups were similar at baseline. In multivariate-adjusted competing risks models with sIPTW, prone positioning was signi cantly associated with reduced mortality (SHR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80, P < 0.005). Using LMM to evaluate the impact of positioning maneuvers on physiological parameters, the oxygenation-saturation index was signi cantly improved during days 1-3 (P < 0.01) whereas oxygenation-saturation index (OSI), oxygenation-index (OI) and arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P a O 2 :FiO 2 ) were signi cantly improved during days 4-7 (P < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning in patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19 is associated with reduced mortality and improved physiologic parameters. One in-hospital death could be averted for every eight patients treated. Replicating results and scaling the intervention are important, but prone positioning may represented an additional therapeutic option in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19.
32c2e402c3c88c3024a4dec3d78ba67c24f89ca6	Bats host virulent zoonotic viruses without experiencing disease. A mechanistic understanding of 25 the impact of bats' virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, 26 on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus 27 infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then 28 developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit 29 models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting 30 robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral 31 propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular 32 morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections 33 within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely 34 cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that 35 diverge from those unique to bats. 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/696195 doi: bioRxiv preprint Recent research advances are beginning to shed light on the molecular mechanisms by 58 which bats avoid pathology from these otherwise virulent pathogens (Brook and Dobson 2015). 59 Bats leverage a suite of species-specific mechanisms to limit viral load, which include host 60 receptor sequence incompatibilities for some bat-virus combinations (Ng et al. 2015; Igarashi et 61 al. 2020) and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine, IFN-, for others (Zhou et al. 62 2016). Typically, the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will 63 induce secretion of type I interferon proteins (IFN-and IFN-), which promote expression and 64 translation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells and render them effectively 65 antiviral (Stetson and Medzhitov 2006). In some bat cells, the transcriptomic blueprints for this 66 IFN response are expressed constitutively, even in the absence of stimulation by viral RNA or 67 DNA (Zhou et al. 2016). In non-flying mammals, constitutive IFN expression would likely elicit 68 widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection, but bats 69
8e7d221febb0647763c74b251362f013b622dedf	The primary intracellular protein degradation systems, including the ubiquitin-proteasome and the lysosome pathways, have been emerging as central regulators of viral infectivity, inflammation, and viral pathogenicity. Viral myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium caused by virus infection in the heart. The disease progression of viral myocarditis occurs in three distinct stages: acute viral infection, immune cell infiltration, and cardiac remodelling. Growing evidence suggests a crucial role for host proteolytic machineries in the regulation of the pathogenesis and progression of viral myocarditis in all three stages. Cardiotropic viruses evolve different strategies to subvert host protein degradation systems to achieve successful viral replication. In addition, these proteolytic systems play important roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infection. Recent evidence also suggests a key role for the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome systems as the primary effectors of protein quality control in the regulation of cardiac remodelling. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the direct interaction between cardiotropic viruses and host proteolytic systems, with an emphasis on coxsackievirus B3, one of the primary aetiological agents causing viral myocarditis, and highlights possible roles of the host degradation systems in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and its progression to dilated cardiomyopathy. ---
f56bebc4d2902fe2707ef1e3d83b3068141218ef	Failure of distinction between self and non-self is regarded a critical event in the pathogenesis of several human diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, uveoretinitis or diabetes mellitus. Autoagressive immune reactions driven by activated autoreactive lymphocytes are a characteristic feature of these autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms by which the pathogenic control of autoreactive lymphocytes deviates from physiology can be studied in appropriate animal models under well-defined experimental conditions. Experimental models of autoimmune diseases in rodent inbred strains allow for the genetic mapping of susceptibility loci and might help to identify candidate genes also relevant to the pathogenesis of human diseases. Finally, the experimental models are valuable tools to develop rational immunotherapeutic strategies. Interesting features of some of the models employed for such research will be introduced in this review.
c0c257aa8b3122b06e969af5cffc046a0924dcb5	In this paper, authors disclose a new concept of pentagonal neutrosophic (PN) approach to solve linear programming (LP) problem. To best of our insight, there is no approach for solving PNLP problem. For the first time, we take up the PNLP problem where the objectives, constraints are considered as pentagonal neutrosophic numbers (PNN). To deign our algorithm, we described the PN arithmetic operation laws and mathematical computation in PNN environment. This proposed method is based on ranking function and convert to its equivalent crisp LP (CrLP) problem. The obtained CrLP issue is presently being tackled by any LP method which is effectively accessible. To legitimize the proposed technique, some numerical tests are given to show the adequacy of the new model.

c916747a33f9b4a986dd0e4a4b853db6814b74f9	Fusion between the viral and target cell membranes is an obligatory step for the infectivity of all enveloped virus, and blocking this process is a clinically validated therapeutic strategy. Viral fusion is driven by specialized proteins which, although specific to each virus, act through a common mechanism, the formation of a complex between two heptad repeat (HR) regions. The HR regions are initially separated in an intermediate termed ''prehairpin'', which bridges the viral and cell membranes, and then fold onto each other to form a 6-helical bundle (6HB), driving the two membranes to fuse. HR-derived peptides can inhibit viral infectivity by binding to the prehairpin intermediate and preventing its transition to the 6HB. The antiviral activity of HR-derived peptides differs considerably among enveloped viruses. For weak inhibitors, potency can be increased by peptide engineering strategies, but sequence-specific optimization is time-consuming. In seeking ways to increase potency without changing the native sequence, we previously reported that attachment to the HR peptide of a cholesterol group (''cholesterol-tagging'') dramatically increases its antiviral potency, and simultaneously increases its halflife in vivo. We show here that antiviral potency may be increased by combining cholesterol-tagging with dimerization of the HR-derived sequence, using as examples human parainfluenza virus, Nipah virus, and HIV-1. Together, cholesteroltagging and dimerization may represent strategies to boost HR peptide potency to levels that in some cases may be compatible with in vivo use, possibly contributing to emergency responses to outbreaks of existing or novel viruses.
8152688db9f76350e5e1667f66656968eb5474d9	Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has caused huge economic losses to the global pork industry. Infection by its causative agent PED virus (PEDV), an Alpha-coronavirus, was previously proven to be mediated by its spike (S) glycoprotein and a cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN). Interestingly, some recent studies have indicated that pAPN is not a functional receptor for PEDV. To date, there is a lack of a direct evidence for the interaction between pAPN and PEDV S protein in vitro. Here, we prepared pAPN ectodomain and the truncated variants of PEDV S protein in Drosophila S2 cells. These recombinant proteins were homogeneous after purification by metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. We then assayed the purified target proteins through immunogenicity tests, PEDV binding interference assays, circular dichroism (CD) measurements, pAPN activity assay and structural determination, demonstrating that they were biologically functional. Finally, we characterized their interactions by gel filtration chromatography, native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. The results showed that their affinities were too low to form complexes, which suggest that pAPN may be controversial as the genuine receptor for PEDV. Therefore, further research needs to be carried out to elucidate the interaction between PEDV and its genuine receptor.

Even administration of 0.6 mg/kg hmPA6 48 h before LeTx challenge protected all tested rats. The results indicate that hmPA6 is a potential candidate for clinical application in anthrax treatment.
ba4cde6a2c8af05185996844f530cfedd35564e3	Objective In vitro studies have demonstrated that lithium has antiviral properties, but evidence from human studies is scarce. Lithium is used as a mood stabilizer to treat patients with bipolar disorder. Here, the aim was to investigate the association between lithium use and the risk of respiratory infections in patients with bipolar disorder. To rule out the possibility that a potential association could be due to lithium's effect on psychiatric symptoms, we also studied the effect of the most common alternative to lithium to prevent mood episodes in bipolar disorder, valproate. We followed 51,509 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the Swedish Patient register 2005-2013. We applied a with-individual design using stratified Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of respiratory infections during treated periods compared with untreated periods. During follow-up, 5,760 respiratory infections were documented in the Swedish Patient Register. The incidence rate was 28% lower during lithium treatment (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.86) and 35% higher during valproate treatment (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.73) compared with periods off treatment. Conclusions This study provides real-world evidence that lithium protects against respiratory infections and suggests that the repurposing potential of lithium for antiviral effects is worthy of investigation.
210842f969c4bbb2e97c9fc8c97ab7dd9bdaa52d	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial has shown that treatment of the common cold with zinc gluconate lozenges resulted in a significant reduction in duration of symptoms of the cold. Patients received zinccontaining lozenges or placebo lozenges every 2 hours for the duration of cold symptoms. The median time to complete resolution of cold symptoms was 4.4 days in the zinc group compared with 7.6 days in the placebo group. The mechanism of action of zinc in tre?ting the common cold remains unknown.
0d206e54d493ef254aa8c65d0ba986e473dab709	Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has recently been reported to elicit the unfolded protein response (UPR) via activation of the PERK/eIF2α (RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2α) pathway. This study attempted to examine which viral protein might be involved in inducing UPR and whether this cellular event would lead to apoptosis of the cells expressing the viral protein. By transient expression, we found that both replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins of PCV2 could induce ER stress as shown by increased phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2α-ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4)-CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) axis. Cap expression, but not Rep, significantly reduced antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and increased caspase-3 cleavage, possibly due to increased expression of CHOP. Since knockdown of PERK by RNA interference clearly reduced Cap-induced CHOP expression, caspase-3 cleavage, and apoptotic cell death possibly by partially rescuing Bcl-2 expression, we propose that there is connection between Cap-induced UPR and apoptosis via the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP/Bcl-2 pathway. This study, together with our earlier studies, provides insight into the mechanisms underlying PCV2 pathogenesis.
d4b76917de146cdbe4c922c15ac3d87d3d483446	Background: Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a lethal systemic disease, caused by the FIP Virus (FIPV); a virulent mutant of Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV). Currently, the viruses virulence determinants and host gene expressions during FIPV infection are not fully understood. Methods: RNA sequencing of Crandell Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells, infected with FIPV strain 79-1146 at 3 hours post infection (h.p.i), were sequenced using the Illumina next generation sequencing approach. Bioinformatic's analysis, based on Felis catus 2X annotated shotgun reference genome, using CLC bio Genome Workbench mapped both control and infected cell reads to 18899 genes out of 19046 annotated genes. Kal's Z test statistical analysis was used to analyse the differentially expressed genes from the infected CRFK cells. Real time RT-qPCR was developed for further transcriptional profiling of three genes (PD-1, PD-L1 and A3H) in infected CRFK cells and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from healthy and FIP-diseased cats. Results: Based on Kal's Z-test, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05 and >1.99 fold change on gene expressions, a total of 61 genes were differentially expressed by both samples, where 44 genes were up-regulated and the remainder were down-regulated. Most genes were closely clustered together, suggesting a homogeneous expression. The majority of the genes that were significantly regulated, were those associated with monocytes-macrophage and Th1 cell functions, and the regulation of apoptosis. Real time RT-qPCR developed focusing on 2 up-regulated genes (PD-L1 and A3H) together with an apoptosis associated gene PD-1 expressions in FIPV infected CRFK cells and in PBMCs from healthy and FIP diagnosed cats produced concordant results with transcriptome data. Conclusion: The possible roles of these genes, and their importance in feline coronaviruses infection, are discussed.
aec923adf0e16d218315a3083aaa71fb9ddb8b39	Although the ecological importance of coinfection is increasingly recognized, analyses of microbial pathogen dynamics in wildlife usually focus on an ad hoc subset of the species present due to technological limitations on detection. Here we demonstrate the use of expression profiles for immunological genes (pattern recognition receptors, cytokines and transcription factors) as a means to identify, without preconception, the likelihood of important acute microbial infections in wildlife. Using a wood mouse population in the UK as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci, typical of an acute microbial infection. These clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population. Animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with ''normal'' expression patterns. If the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection. The form of survey described here, combined with next generation nucleic acids sequencing methods for the broad detection of microbial infectious agents in individuals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles, could be a powerful tool for revealing unrecognized, ecologically important infectious agents circulating in wildlife populations.
fb0c4eb07b7e88e2e71569663b87d28fa55a59f6	COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease capable of causing severe pneumonia. We aimed to characterize a group of critically ill patients in a single-center study. This was a retrospective case series of 23 patients with confirmed COVID-19-related critical illness in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Hangzhou Zhejiang Province between January 22 and March 20, 2020. Of the 23 critically ill patients, the median age was 66 years (interquartile range [IQR] 59-80 years). The median time from disease onset to ICU admission was 10 days (IQR 6-11 days), to mechanical ventilation (MV) was 11 days (IQR 7.75-13 days), to artificial liver plasma exchange was 12 days (IQR 9.75-14.75 days), and to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was 22 days (IQR 17.5-30 days). Nine patients required high flow oxygen. Fourteen patients received MV. Six required ECMO. Nine received artificial liver plasma exchange. Mortality was 0 at day 28. Mortality was 0 at day 28 in our single-center study. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation reduced the requirements for ventilator support. Artificial liver plasma exchange significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels. These supportive therapies helped to extend the patients' survival times and increase the chance of follow-up treatments.

6427e85b4473cc2a84635b08384e479c860270da	Methods: A systematic review and pooled analysis was performed. Eligible studies were 23 identified from database and hand searches up to March 2, 2020. Data on clinical (including 24 laboratory and radiological) and epidemiological (including demographic) characteristics of 25 confirmed COVID-19 cases were extracted and combined by simple pooling. 26 27 Results: Of 644 studies identified, 69 studies (involving 48,926 patients) were included in the 28 analysis. The average age of the patients was 49.16 years. A total of 51.46% of the patients 29 were men and 52.32% were non-smokers. Hypertension (50.82%) and diabetes (20.89%) were 30 the most frequent comorbidities observed. The most common symptoms were fever (83.21%), 31 cough (61.74%), and myalgia or fatigue (30.22%). Altered levels of blood and biochemical 32 parameters were observed in a proportion of the patients. Most of the patients (78.50%) had 33 bilateral lung involvements, and 5.86% showed no CT findings indicative of viral pneumonia. 34 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (28.36%), acute cardiac injury (7.89%) and acute kidney 35 injury (7.60%) were the most common complications recorded. 36 37 Conclusions: Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were mostly 38 heterogeneous and non-specific.

a523866ce506078aa6ac5af39ce7edb135787093	Introduction: Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a common viral infection that typically causes fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy in young patients. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of IM, followed by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Given that serological testing is associated with limitations regarding its accuracy, availability, and time to receive results, clinical differentiation based on symptoms, signs, and basic tests would be useful. We evaluated whether clinical findings could be used to differentiate EBV-IM from CMV-IM. Methods: In this single-center retrospective case-control study, we evaluated >14-year-old patients with serologically confirmed EBV-IM or CMV-IM during 2006e2017. We compared the patients' symptoms, physical findings, blood counts, and serum biomarkers to create three regression models: model 1 (symptoms and signs), model 2 (model 1 plus sonographic hepatosplenomegaly and blood counts), and model 3 (model 2 plus hepatobiliary biomarkers). Results: Among the 122 patients (72.6%) with EBV-IM and 46 patients (27.4%) with CMV-IM, the median age was 25 years and 82 patients (48.8%) were male. The median age was 10 years older in the CMV-IM group (p < 0.001) and the median interval from onset to visit was 5 days longer in the CMV-IM group (p < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that EBV-IM was predicted by younger age, short onset-to-visit interval, lymphadenopathy, tonsillar white coat, hepatosplenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis, and elevations of lactate dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. All regression models had areas under the curve of >0.9. Conclusion: History and physical findings, especially when used with atypical lymphocytosis and sonographic hepatosplenomegaly, can help physicians differentiate EBV-IM from CMV-IM.

13af98c04364a1cc9aaf5afc57a80b60c8b8d2f1	Objectives Enhancement of the potential ability of biomacromolecules to cross cell membranes is a critical step for development of effective therapeutic vaccine especially DNA vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. The supercharged proteins were known as powerful weapons for delivery of different types of cargoes such as DNA and protein. Hence, we applied B1 protein with ? 43 net charges obtained from a single frameshift in the gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) for delivery of two multiepitope DNA constructs (nef-vpu-gp160-p24 and nefvif-gp160-p24) in vitro and in vivo for the first time. For this purpose, B1 protein was generated in bacterial expression system under native conditions, and used to interact with both DNA constructs. Our data indicated that B1 protein (* 27 kDa) was able to form a stable nanoparticle (* 80-110 nm) with both DNA constructs at nitrogen: phosphate (N: P) ratio of 1:1. Moreover, the transfection efficiency of B1 protein for DNA delivery into HEK-293T cell line indicated that the cellular uptake of nef-vif-gp160-p24 DNA/ B1 and nef-vpu-gp160-p24 DNA/ B1 nanoparticles was about 32-35% with lower intensity as compared to TurboFect commercial reagent. On the other hand, immunization of BALB/c mice with different modalities demonstrated that B1 protein could enhance the levels of antibody, IFN-gamma and Granzyme B eliciting potent and strong Th1-directed cellular immunity. Conclusion Generally, our findings showed the potency of B1 protein as a promising gene delivery system to improve an effective therapeutic vaccine against HIV-1 infection.

70fe1da70b714ba14f71d217ecf93da18e291aa7	In comparison with its economic importance, available genomic information of the olive flounder is very limited. The mass mortality caused by variety of pathogens (virus, bacteria and parasites) is main problem in aquaculture industry, including in olive flounder culture. In this study, we carried out transcriptome analysis using the olive flounder gill tissues after infection of three types of pathogens (Virus; Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, Bacteria; Streptococcus parauberis, and Parasite; Miamiensis avidus), respectively. As a result, we identified total 12,415 differentially expressed genes (DEG) from viral infection, 1,754 from bacterial infection, and 795 from parasite infection, respectively. To investigate the effects of pathogenic infection on immune response, we analyzed Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis with DEGs and sorted immune-related GO terms per three pathogen groups. Especially, we verified various GO terms, and genes in these terms showed down-regulated expression pattern. In addition, we identified 67 common genes (10 up-regulated and 57 down-regulated) present in three pathogen infection groups. Our goals are to provide plenty of genomic knowledge about olive flounder transcripts for further research and report genes, which were changed in their expression after specific pathogen infection. Olive flounder is one of main marine species having high economic value in the countries of East Asia. Because of industrial importance by increasing of demand, it is serious subject to understand the pathogenic infection and production performance of olive flounder. Mass mortality of fishes is the most severe problem, accompanying vast deficit in aquaculture farm. Efforts to prevent regrettable death have especially been conducted in immunology 1-3 . However, so far, it is hard to figure out cause of death exactly in short time because of variables of expansive marine ecosystem. Mass mortality of olive flounder was normally caused by diseases via various sources of infection such as virus, bacteria, or parasite from external environment. Viruses depend on host cell ribosomes to produce their proteins, and sometime use host cell DNA and RNA polymerases for replication and transcription, respectively. Many viruses encode proteins that modify the host transcription or translation apparatus to favor the synthesis of viral proteins over those of the host cell. Among
bfaeeaddeb65011d6a873d35db972d986ab8a0a8	As urban areas continue to expand and replace natural and agricultural landscapes, the ability to manage and conserve native wildlife within urban environments is becoming increasingly important. To do so we first need to understand species' responses to local-level habitat attributes in order to inform the decision-making process and on-ground conservation actions. Patterns in the occurrence of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species in 59 sites located in remnant urban habitat fragments of Brisbane City were assessed against local-level environmental characteristics of each site. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling ordination, and principal axis correlation were used to investigate relationships between species' occurrences and environmental characteristics. Native reptiles were most strongly associated with the presence of termite mounds, a high amount of fallen woody material, and a moderate amount of weed cover. Native small mammals were most strongly associated with the presence of grass trees (Xanthorrhoea spp.), and both reptiles and small mammals were negatively influenced by increased soil compaction. Significant floristic characteristics were considered to be important as structural, rather than compositional, habitat elements. Therefore, habitat structure, rather than vegetation composition, appears to be most important for determining native, terrestrial reptile and small mammal species assemblages in urban forest fragments. We discuss the management implications in relation to human disturbances and local-level management of urban remnants.
154430671510477d7d3907390e4b8128e8a306d6	As the backbone for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), nurses have been actively playing key roles in cabin hospitals, isolation wards, and intensive care units (ICUs) for critical cases. Anesthesia nurses have their own professional specialties, such as airway management, the use and maintenance of life support equipment, including ventilators, and the use of high-flow oxygen equipment. With rich experience in emergency responses and nursing, anesthesia nurses, along with emergency nurses and critical care nurses, play important roles during the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In our hospital, 27 of 34 anesthesia nurses participated in the front-line fight against COVID-19 and did an excellent job. Anesthesia care by nurses is relatively new in China, and the role of anesthesia nurses during a disaster response has not been fully appreciated. Given their specialty, anesthesia nurses have played important roles in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. We hope that authorities will consider including anesthesia nurses in national disaster response medical rescue teams.
503720a53e5c63f6d99b150d92268eedb180dc9a	Policy decisions about public health services differ from those for personal health services. Both require trade-offs between such policy goals as liberty, security, efficiency, and equity. In public health, however, decisions about who will approve, pay for, and deliver services are often accompanied by decisions on when and how to compel individual behaviour. Policy becomes complex because different stakeholders interpret evidence differently: stakeholders may assign different weights to policy goals and may even define the same goals differently. In the debate over mandatory annual influenza vaccination for health care workers, for example, proponents as well as opponents of mandatory vaccination may convey arguments in security terms. Those in favour of mandatory vaccination emphasize subclinical infections and duty of care (public security) while those opposed emphasize risk of adverse events (personal security). Proponents assert less worker absenteeism (efficiency) while opponents stress coercion and alternate personal infection control measures (liberty and individual rights/responsibilities). Consequently, stakeholders talk past each other. Determining the place of mandatory influenza vaccination for health care workers thus demands reconciling policy trade-offs and clarifying the underlying disputes hidden in the language of the policy debate.
882c531d4f37cb8623df64d75763cb85153e42d9	Background Current guidelines recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy be offered for patients with acute cholecystitis except those deemed as high risk. Few studies have examined the impact of frailty on outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association of frailty with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. Methods Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystectomy were identified from 2005 to 2010 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP). The Modified Frailty Index (mFI) was used a surrogate for frailty, and patients were stratified as non-frail (mFI 0), low frailty (mFI 1-2), intermediate frailty (mFI 3-4) and high frailty (mFI ≥ 5). Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Receiver operator curves (ROC) and an area under the curve (AUC) were generated to determine accuracy of mFI in predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality. Results Of the 6898 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3245 (47%) patients were non-frail. There were 2913 (42%) patients with low-frailty, 649 (9%) patients with intermediate frailty, and 91 (2%) with high frailty. Clavien IV complications were higher for intermediate frail patients (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.00-3.28, p = 0.050) and high-frail patients (OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.98-10.7, p < 0.001). Additionally, mortality was higher for patients with intermediate frailty (OR 4 .69, 95% CI 1.37-16.0, p = 0.014) and high frailty (OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.67-55.5, p = 0.001). The mFI had excellent accuracy for mortality (AUC = 0.83) and Clavien IV complications (AUC = 0.73). Conclusion Frailty is associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.
eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	Retrospective comparisons of the prevalence and age, where appropriate, of some childhood infectious illnesses and vaccinations, together with serological evidence for exposure to 16 viruses, many of which have previously been implicated in the aetiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) were made in 177 patients with acute optic neuritis, other recent isolated demyelinating episodes or established MS and 164 controls. The expected high frequency of HLA-DR2 in patients with demyelinating disease was matched by preselection of normal controls with this antigen (DR2 + ); the remaining individuals were classified as HLA-DR2 negative/DR3 positive (DR3+) or HLA-DR2 and 3 negative (DR2/3 -). Cases were compared with controls, collectively and in analyses restricted to each genetic group; these comparisons were repeated considering the three categories of patients with demyelination and two control populations separately. All DR2 + , DR3+ and DR2/3 -individuals were compared in a single analysis to assess the effect of HLA type itself on the results. Patients with demyelinating disease had rubella and measles at a later age and reported mumps infection more frequently than controls. Age of typhoid vaccination and duration of exposure to domestic dogs was higher in all cases than controls. Age of measles and mumps, but not rubella, was higher in DR2+ cases than controls; but differences were not observed in the other genetic groups. Higher rubella antibody titres were present in all cases than controls and in analyses confined to DR2+ individuals in whom higher Epstein Barr virus antibody titres were also present. Measles haemagglutination inhibition and parainfluenza I antibody titres were increased and influenza A antibodies detected less frequently in all patients with optic neuritis and those with DR2 compared with appropriate controls; influenza B antibody titres were lower in all DR2 4-cases than controls. Higher adenovirus and varicella zoster antibody titres were present in DR2/3-patients with demyelination and other neurological diseases compared with normal controls. Overall, older age of infection and higher antibody titres were observed more often in patients with optic neuritis, in particular DR2 + cases, than other individuals with demyelination or controls. Our serological results are consistent with the presence of abnormal HLA-immunological reactivity in patients with MS but cannot be explained only by an effect of DR type itself; age at which susceptible individuals develop some common childhood infections may also influence the subsequent development of the disease.
ec0169d46b60dc120f431e11e71f0a908890a148	High-level expression of the ORF6 gene of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been proved very difficult. In this work, we cloned and sequenced the ORF6 gene of PRRSV and found that it could not be expressed in Pichia pastoris strain GS115. Then, the ORF6 gene was modified and synthesized based on the codon bias, poly (A) signal of yeast expression system and secondary structure of 5 H -end mRNA of foreign gene. The modified gene was inserted into the yeast expression vector pPICZaA, induced and expressed by the same methods. The recombinant protein with a molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa was screened by SDS-PAGE and identified by Western blot with convalescent sera of animals infected with CH-1a strain of PRRSV. The results indicated that it was similar to the native protein. The expression level of the recombinant protein could attain 2.0 g/L. In the meanwhile, the optimal conditions for expression were determined. It provides an additional means for studying the structural and functional characteristics of PRRSV ORF6 gene.
5ff9a465e9df120322356d9b3af7427c7830cba6	Objectives: To evaluate effectiveness of a nasal resveratrol/carboxymethyl-β-glucan solution compared to nasal saline solution: a) on common cold symptoms by means of a validated measure scale (CARIFS score), b) on Rhinovirus infection and CCL2, CCL5, IL8, IL6, CXCL10 and TLR2 expression in nasal swabs, c) on frequency of relapses after 30 days of follow-up. Methods: 89 infants with respiratory infection symptoms were randomly assigned to receive either a nasal resveratrol/carboxymethyl-β-glucan solution or nasal saline solution. All patients were evaluated with CARIFS score at enrollment, after 48 h, 7 and 30 days by physicians and parents. Nasal swabs were obtained at enrollment, after 48 h and after one week. Results: CARIFS score improved in both groups. Episodes of sneezing and cough were fewer in study group after 7 days of follow-up (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found on nasopharyngeal swabs in Rhinovirus detection and cytokines expression after 48 h, nor in 30 days relapses. TLR2 expression was significantly higher in Rhinovirus infected children of the study group. No adverse effects occurred. Conclusions: These data suggest that a solution containing resveratrol plus carboxymethyl-β-glucan might have a positive impact on both clinical and socio-economic burden due to infant common cold.
fbf86a73100227664edcdc981bbbccb9782602eb	Bats have increasingly been recognized as the natural reservoir of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus, and other coronaviruses found in mammals. However, little research has been conducted on bat coronaviruses in South Korea. In this study, bat samples (332 oral swabs, 245 fecal samples, 38 urine samples, and 57 bat carcasses) were collected at 33 natural bat habitat sites in South Korea. RT-PCR and sequencing were performed for specific coronavirus genes to identify the bat coronaviruses in different bat samples. Coronaviruses were detected in 2.7% (18/672) of the samples: 13 oral swabs from one species of the family Rhinolophidae, and four fecal samples and one carcass (intestine) from three species of the family Vespertiliodae. To determine the genetic relationships of the 18 sequences obtained in this study and previously known coronaviruses, the nucleotide sequences of a 392-nt region of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were analyzed phylogenetically. Thirteen sequences belonging to SARS-like betacoronaviruses showed the highest nucleotide identity (97.1-99.7%) with Bat-CoV-JTMC15 reported in China. The other five sequences were most similar to MERS-like betacoronaviruses. Four nucleotide sequences displayed the highest identity (94.1-95.1%) with Bat-CoV-HKU5 from Hong Kong. The one sequence from a carcass showed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) with Bat-CoV-SC2013 from China. These results suggest that careful surveillance of coronaviruses from bats should be continued, because animal and human infections may result from the genetic variants present in bat coronavirus reservoirs.
d5c762ca1af905c8e8c8d1025d918d78ec9233a4	Sustainability is increasingly concerned with the complex interactions between nature and society, and we need to seek solutions towards the challenges that threaten humanity's collective wellbeing. Towards this end, it is critical to advance the application of research examining the dynamic interactions of the components of complex socialecological systems and their emerging properties. A key research area is on advancing tools and strategies relevant to the evaluation and strengthening of resilience. Redundancy, diversity, and modularity are important characteristics of resilience with a high potential for application in various critical social-ecological systems. This paper provides a critical overview of the theoretical underpinnings of modularity and redundancy and their application in measuring resilience of trade networks with implications for public policy and institutional design.

7ab238943d042537c990140af39989af8d9611fc	Respiratory pathogens have been detected in forensic investigations using multiple techniques; however, no study has examined the use of automated, nested, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (ANM-PCR), commonly used in living patients, in the forensic setting. This retrospective study assessed the utility of ANM-PCR in detecting respiratory pathogens in the pediatric forensic setting. Respiratory samples from 35 cases were tested for up to 20 respiratory pathogens. 51.4% of these cases yielded a positive ANM-PCR result, 20% of which were considered the cause of or contributory to death. The most commonly detected pathogens were rhinovirus/enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, and these were the only pathogens determined to play a significant role in cause of death. The sampled sites and postmortem intervals tested did not affect the likelihood of a positive or negative test. ANM-PCR panels are effective, affordable, and rapid ancillary tools in evaluating cause of death in the forensic pediatric population.
94fd80b3bb85b07966815d3418041d9978253612	Naturally occurring defective interfering RNAs have been found in 4 of 14 coronavirus species. They range in size from 2.2 kb to approximately 25 kb, or 80% of the 30-kb parent virus genome. The large DI RNAs do not in all cases appear to require helper virus for intracellular replication and it has been postulated that they may on their own function as agents of disease. Coronavirus DI RNAs appear to arise by internal deletions (through nonhomologous recombination events) on the virus genome or on DI RNAs of larger size by a polymerase strand-switching (copy-choice) mechanism. In addition to their use in the study of virus RNA replication and virus assembly, coronavirus DI RNAs are being used in a major way to study the mechanism of a high-frequency, site-specific RNA recombination event that leads to leader acquisition during virus replication (i.e., the leader fusion event that occurs during synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs, and the leader-switching event that can occur during DI RNA replication), a distinguishing feature of coronaviruses (and arteriviruses). Coronavirus DI RNAs are also being engineered as vehicles for the generation of targeted recombinants of the parent virus genome. 1997 Academic Press KEY WORDS: RNA recombination; leader fusion; recombinant coronaviruses.

5a3396c6e07a333da848102ff21155472a64347d	36 development of new preclinical discovery platforms that can more rapidly identify 37 therapeutics that are active in vitro and also translate in vivo. Here we show that 38 human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by highly 39 differentiated human primary lung airway epithelium and endothelium can be 40 used to model virus entry, replication, strain-dependent virulence, host cytokine 41 production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection 42 by respiratory viruses with great pandemic potential. We provide a first 43 demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza A virus-44 infected organ chip cultures and show that co-administration of the approved 45 anticoagulant drug, nafamostat, can double oseltamivir's therapeutic time 46 window. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airway Chips were 47 used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition 48 in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the 49 Organ Chip platform. When administered in human Airway Chips under flow at a 50 clinically relevant dose, one drug -amodiaquine -significantly inhibited infection 51 by a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus. Proof of concept was provided by showing 52 that amodiaquine and its active metabolite (desethylamodiaquine) also 53 significantly reduce viral load in both direct infection and animal-to-animal 54 transmission models of native SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. These data 55 highlight the value of Organ Chip technology as a more stringent and 56 physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing, and suggest that 57 amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing. 58 Confidential 59 The increasing incidence of potential pandemic viruses, such as influenza A virus, 60 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe acute respiratory 61 virus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, requires development of new preclinical 62 approaches that can accelerate development of effective therapeutics and 63 prophylactics. The most rapid way to confront a pandemic challenge would be to 64 repurpose existing drugs that are approved for other medical indications as antiviral 65 therapeutics. While researchers and clinicians around the world are attempting to do 66 this for the COVID-19 pandemic, current approaches have been haphazard and 67 generally rely entirely on results of in vitro screens with cell lines. This has resulted in 68 equivocal results regarding drug efficacies and possible toxicity risks as in the case of 69 hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine 1-4 , and thus, there is a great need to address this 70 problem in a more systematic and human-relevant way. Recognizing the potential 71 danger of unforeseen pandemics over two years ago, the Defense Advanced Research 72 Projects Agency (DARPA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded work to 73 explore whether human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture technology 74 might be helpful in confronting potential biothreat challenges. We previously showed 75 that Organ Chips can recapitulate human organ physiology, disease states, and 76 therapeutic responses to clinically relevant drug exposures with high fidelity 5-9 . Here we 77 show how human Lung Airway Chips may be used to model human lung responses to 78 viral infection in vitro, and in concert with higher throughput cell-based assays and 79 animal models, to identify existing approved drugs that have the potential to be 80 Confidential repurposed for treating or preventing spread of viral pandemics caused by influenza A 81 virus or SARS-CoV-2. 82 Infections by respiratory viruses and antiviral drug screening assays are 83 currently studied in vitro using cultured established cell lines, primary tissue-derived 84 human cells, human organoids, and ex vivo human lung tissue cultures despite all 85 having significant limitations (Supplementary Table 1) 10-13 . For example, established 86 cell lines commonly demonstrate various defects in their capacity to elicit an antiviral 87 state because normally elicited interferons cause cell cycle arrest, and so this dynamic 88 is often selected against with continuous passaging 14 . Arguably even more important, 89 cell lines and even human primary cells grown in conventional cultures do not exhibit 90 the highly differentiated tissue structures and functions (e.g., mucociliary clearance) 91 seen in living human organs. Explant cultures of human respiratory tract tissue 92 circumvent this limitation, but their availability is limited and their viability can only be 93 maintained for a short time (4-10 days) 12,15 . While human lung organoids provide a 94 more functional lung epithelium, they do not allow culturing of the epithelium at an air-95 liquid interface (ALI) or modeling of other physiologically relevant organ-level features of 96 lung, such as mucus layer formation, mucociliary clearance, cross-talk between 97 epithelium and endothelium, or recruitment of circulating immune cells 10,11 , all of which 98 play key roles in host responses to infection by respiratory viruses. Moreover, in all of 99 these culture models, drug studies are carried out under static conditions that cannot 100 predict human responses to clinically relevant, dynamic drug exposure profiles that 101 result from complex pharmacokinetics (PK) in vivo. Thus, there is an urgent need for 102 alternative preclinical in vitro models that specifically mimic human lung responses to 103 Confidential infection by potential pandemic respiratory viruses, and because of their ability to 104 recapitulate human organ-level physiology and pathophysiology, human Lung Chips 105 offer a potential solution.

612990aa8d0c35b9bc4d8d82fb4d6c05b768cd0c	Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of death associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. IGF-1 has been implicated in ARDS, yet its role in relation to COVID-19-related lung injury has not been investigated. We hypothesize that blockage of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mitigates lung injury and decreases the risk of death in patients COVID-19-related ARDS. Patients with fibroproliferative ARDS have been shown to have increased IGF-1 and IGF-1R staining in lung tissue specimens. Rising levels of IGF-1 in bronchioalveolar fluid (BAL) and increased IGF-1 mRNA expression in lung tissues (but declining serum IGF-1 levels) have been found in late stage ARDS compared with early lung injury. Blockage of IGF-1R decreases lung tissue damage and increases survival in bleomycin-induced as well as H1N1 influenza-related lung injury in animal models. Teprotumumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1R that was FDA-approved in 2020 for the treatment of Graves' orbitopathy. In order to determine if teprotumumab may reduce lung injury and death related to ARDS in the setting of COVID-19, preliminary clinical data is needed. IGF-1 levels in serum and BAL fluid must be measured in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. Histopathology from lung samples from patients with COVID-19-related ARDS must be examined for increased expression of the IGF-1R. Once these are ascertained, and if the data support IGF-1 involvement, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2A trial of teprotumumab therapy in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS and non-COVID-19-related ARDS designed to generate initial data on short-term efficacy, safety, dosing and administration should be performed.
9a52d4e8ab876c95e4607782e33b2685f47c1c50	To report the reduction in new neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) referrals during the COVID-19 pandemic and estimate the impact of delayed treatment on visual outcomes at one year. Retrospective clinical audit and simulation model. Multiple UK NHS ophthalmology centres. Data on the reduction in new nAMD referrals was obtained from four NHS Trusts in England comparing April 2020 to April 2019. To estimate the potential impact on one-year visual outcomes, a stratified bootstrap simulation model was developed drawing on an electronic medical records dataset of 20,825 nAMD eyes from 27 NHS Trusts. Main outcome measures: Simulated mean visual acuity and proportions of eyes with vision ≤ 6/60, ≤ 6/24 and ≥ 6/12 at one year under four hypothetical scenarios: no treatment delay, 3, 6 and 9-month treatment delays. Estimated additional number of eyes with vision ≤ 6/60 at one year nationally. The number of nAMD referrals at four major eye treatment hospital groups based in England dropped on average by 72% (range 65 to 87%) in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Simulated one-year visual outcomes for 1000 nAMD eyes with a 3-month treatment delay suggested an increase in the proportion of eyes with vision ≤ 6/60 from 15.5% (13.2 to 17.9) to 23.3% (20.7 to25.9), and a decrease in the proportion of eyes with vision ≥ 6/12 (driving vision) from 35.1% All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. : medRxiv preprint nAMD vision loss during COVID 4 (32.1 to 38.1) to 26.4% (23.8 to29.2). Outcomes worsened incrementally with longer modelled delays. Assuming nAMD referrals are reduced to this level at the national level for only one month, these simulated results suggest an additional 186-365 eyes with vision ≤ 6/60 at one-year with even a short treatment delay. We report a large decrease in nAMD referrals during the first month of COVID-19 lockdown and provide an important public health message regarding the risk of delayed treatment. As a conservative estimate, a treatment delay of 3 months could lead to a >50% relative increase in the number of eyes with vision ≤ 6/60 and 25% relative decrease in the number of eyes with driving vision at one year.

4bef38bc6445329c2ebb4beb95b4f79c03d90edd	The effect of corona discharge-generated air ions on the filtration of aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 was studied. A carbon-fiber ionizer was installed upstream of a medium-efficiency air filter to generate air ions, which were used to charge the virus aerosols and increase their filtration efficiency. After the virus aerosols were captured by the filter for a certain time interval, they were exposed to a newly incoming air ion flow. Captured virus particles were detached from the filter by sonication, and their antiviral efficiency due to air ions was calculated by counting the plaque-forming units. The antiviral efficiency increased with ion exposure time and ion concentration. When the concentration of positive air ions was 10 7 ions/cm 3 , the antiviral efficiencies were 46.1, 78.8, and 83.7% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. When the ionizer was operated in a bipolar mode, the number concentrations of positive and negative ions were 6.6×10 6 and 3.4×10 6 ions/cm 3 , respectively, and the antiviral efficiencies were 64.3, 89.1, and 97.4% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. As a quantitative parameter for the performance evaluation of air ions, the susceptibility constant of bacteriophage MS2 to positive, negative, bipolar air ions was calculated as 5.5×10 −3 , 5.4×10 −3 and 9.5×10 −3 , respectively. These susceptibility constants showed bipolar ion treatment was more effective about 1.7 times than unipolar ion treatment.
9d2ae83f4f1a728795e7ea934c32e98ce15914d6	Effective mitigation of coronavirus diseases pandemic required true adoption of precautionary measures by the masses, that primarily depends upon their knowledge and practices behaviors. The current study aimed to evaluate the knowledge; practices of Pakistani residents regarding COVID-19 and factors associated with good knowledge and positive practices. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 15among 689 Pakistanis by using a validated self-administered questionnaire. Regression analysis was applied to find potential predictor of knowledge and practices. Of 689 participants, more than half had good knowledge; 80% had good practices regarding COVID-19 and majority seek knowledge from social media. Knowledge was significantly higher (OR>1.00, p<0.05) among educated and higher income participants. Positive practices were significantly (OR>1.00, p<0.05) related to the older age (≥50 years), higher education, higher income and good knowledge regarding COVID-19. The study concluded that Pakistani residents had good knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 yet there are gaps in specific aspects of knowledge, and practice that should be focused in future awareness and educational campaigns. The study recommends the ministry of health authorities to promote all precautionary and preventive measures of COVID-19-consisting of a better-organized approach-to all strata of society: less privileged people, older ones and less educated people, in order to have equilibrium of knowledge about COVID-19; hence effective implementation of precautionary measures.
cfffac30aa716974333312a44475097d94c8f475	Simply by repetition, medical facts can become enshrined as truth even when there is little empirical evidence supporting them. We present an intuitive and clear visual design for tracking the citation history of a particular scientific fact over time. We apply this method to data from a previously published literature review on the incubation period of nine respiratory viral infections. The resulting citation networks reveal that the conventional wisdom about the incubation period for these diseases was based on a small fraction of available data and in one case, on no retrievable empirical evidence. Overall, 50% of all incubation period statements did not provide a source for their estimate and 65% of original sources for incubation period data were not incorporated into subsequent publications. More standardized and widely available methods for visualizing these histories of medical evidence are needed to ensure that conventional wisdom cannot stray too far from empirically supported knowledge.
1b22cceade80fa373b77989b1b82599b179ea1e7	Many traditional vaccines have proven to be incapable of controlling newly emerging infectious diseases. They have also achieved limited success in the fight against a variety of human cancers. Thus, innovative vaccine strategies are highly needed to overcome the global burden of these diseases. Advances in molecular biology and reverse genetics have completely restructured the concept of vaccinology, leading to the emergence of state-of-the-art technologies for vaccine design, development and delivery. Among these modern vaccine technologies are the recombinant viral vectored vaccines, which are known for their incredible specificity in antigen delivery as well as the induction of robust immune responses in the vaccinated hosts. Although a number of viruses have been used as vaccine vectors, genetically engineered Newcastle disease virus (NDV) possesses some useful attributes that make it a preferable candidate for vectoring vaccine antigens. Here, we review the molecular biology of NDV and discuss the reverse genetics approaches used to engineer the virus into an efficient vaccine vector. We then discuss the prospects of the engineered virus as an efficient vehicle of vaccines against cancer and several infectious diseases of man and animals. Viruses 2020, 12, 451 2 of 23 the inactivated vaccines, which are known to be incredibly safe as a result of their non-replicating nature, but are often poorly immunogenic and therefore, do not elicit a long lasting immunity [6] . Furthermore, both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have failed to effectively curb the menace of a variety of major global pathogens. These limitations altogether quest for the need to develop novel vaccine strategies that could potentially overcome the weaknesses of the conventional vaccines. Interestingly, the recent advancements in molecular genetics and bioinformatics have paved way for the emergence of next generation vaccine technologies such as synthetic peptides, DNA vaccines, recombinant viral-vectored vaccines, and reverse genetics-based vaccines, which are all currently on the path of revolutionizing medical and veterinary vaccinology [7, 8] . Newcastle disease virus is one of the most important avian viral pathogens that inflict huge economic losses in the global poultry industry [9] . The virus is highly genetically diverse, with currently more than 20 phylogenetically distinct genotypes based on the recently proposed NDV taxonomy criteria [10] . Following the recovery of the first strain of the virus by reverse genetics 20 years ago [11] , tremendous progress has been recorded in the genetic manipulation of various strains of the virus. So far, NDV has been engineered to express rationally designed, safe and highly stable protective antigens against several human and animal pathogens ( Table 1) . The virus has also been genetically reprogrammed for improved oncolytic efficacy against a variety of human cancers (Table 2) . Thus, the prospects of genetically engineered NDV in the era of modern vaccinology cannot be over emphasized. In this review, we start by describing the molecular biology of NDV and the various approaches used in the genetic manipulation of the virus for effective vaccine delivery. We then discuss the potentials of the engineered virus as a vaccine against cancer and other life threatening diseases in man and against economically important viruses in various domestic animals. Newcastle Disease Virus Ultrastructurally, the particles of NDV are pleomorphic in shape with diameters ranging from 100-500nm. They essentially consist of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) surrounded by the viral envelop with its surface glycoproteins that project as spikes. The RNP is made up of the RNA genome completely encapsidated by a protein called nucleocapsid protein (NP). Other proteins associated with the RNP include the large protein (L), which is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and its co-factor, the phosphoprotein (P) [12] . Together, they form a helical structure surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelop with surface projections of hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion proteins (F). The matrix protein (M) is found just beneath the viral envelop and maintains the shape and structure of the virion [13] . The genome of NDV is either 15,198, 15,192 or 15,186 bp in size [14]. It is a single stranded, non-segmented negative sense RNA that consists of leader (55 nucleotides) and trailer (114 nucleotides) terminal sequences separated by six genes in the order 3 -NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5 . These terminal sequences are highly conserved across most of the paramyxoviruses [12,15] and house the regulatory signals for virus replication [16] . In addition, each gene in the NDV genome encodes a single protein and is characterized by having a coding sequence flanked by highly conserved gene start (GS) and a gene end (GE) transcriptional signals [17] . These features of NDV genome are shared by most of the paramyxoviruses, suggesting a common transcription and replication strategy. Using reverse genetics, RNP associated viral structural proteins (NP, P and L) have been shown to collectively contribute to NDV virulence. Experiments involving the swapping of NP between pathogenically different strains revealed a change in virulence of the generated recombinant virus only when NP along with its other replication proteins partners (P and L) were swapped together [18] . Notably, the NP encapsidates the entire genomic RNA while the L functions as an RNA-dependent Viruses 2020, 12, 451 3 of 23 RNA polymerase that binds to P protein and forms a complex that recognizes the RNP for initiating the process of transcription and replication [19] . Recent evidence has indicated that the L protein can significantly contribute to NDV virulence through its role in virus replication [20] . However, specific regions within the L protein responsible for determining NDV virulence are yet to be discovered. The F protein is the major determinant of NDV virulence. It is synthesized in an inactive form, F 0 , and then becomes activated following its proteolytic cleavage into F1 and F2. The enzyme involved in the cleavage is determined by the amino acid composition of the cleavage site, which in turn varies in virulent and avirulent NDV strains [21] . Avirulent pathotypes generally have a monobasic F cleavage site acted upon by extracellular trypsin like proteases. On the other hand, the virulent strains have multiple basic amino acid residues at their cleavage sites that are activated by intracellular proteases of the furin family [22] . In addition to the cleavage site's amino acid composition, the sites of post translational modifications, notably glycosylation sites, may play a significant role in the virus virulence. Recently, [23] observed an increase in virus virulence following deletion of N glycans from the heptad repeats of the NDV F protein. Furthermore, [24] showed a dramatic increase in NDV virulence when the cytoplasmic tail from a mesogenic strain was used to replace its counterparts in another lentogenic strain, suggesting the possible role of the F protein's cytoplasmic domain in determining the virulence of NDV. The HN protein is also believed to be a determinant of NDV virulence. Depending on the location of the termination codon, the HN protein has several subtypes of varying length, with most of the avirulent strains encoding the longest protein made up of 616 amino acids. In contrast, the virulent strains encode the shortest HN proteins of about 571 amino acids. Lentogenic strains such as LaSota and B1 encode an HN protein of 577 amino acids in length [25] . Other lengths of HN protein reported include 572, 580, 582, and 585 amino acids. To investigate whether the HN length diversity is directly associated with the virus virulence, several NDV chimeras with shortened or extended HN length were generated by reverse genetics and tested for pathogenicity using standard procedures. It was revealed that varying the lengths of HN directly affects the functions related to viral replication but not pathogenicity [26] . V protein, a non-structural protein encoded by the p gene, also plays a vital role in determining NDV virulence. The role of V protein is clearly manifested during viral pathogenesis as an interferon antagonist, by selectively targeting STAT-1 for degradation [27] . Recombinant NDVs that cannot express V protein often show no evidence of growth in 9-10 days chicken embryonated eggs and a very impaired growth in cell culture. Those recombinant viruses also manifest sensitivity to exogenous interferon administration, indicating that the V protein plays a role in NDV replication and virulence [27] . Collectively, virulence of NDV is determined by individual or collective roles of both structural and non-structural viral proteins. Viruses 2020, 12, 451 16 of 23 are enormous. Given its simple genome, efficient replication, host restriction, and non-pathogenicity in most mammals, NDV is likely to be the vector of choice against many other emerging diseases of man and domestic animals.
2cc5cccb3c6f69704f97a19e680fe3e16496beff	Behc ßet's disease (BD) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease with unclear etiopathogenesis. Although gene variants of CC chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1) have been reported, the protein expression of CCR1 in patients with BD remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the frequencies of CCR1 + cells in a herpes simplex virus-induced mouse model of BD. The frequencies of CCR1 + cells on the surface and in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry. The CCR1 + cells were significantly down-regulated in BD mice compared with the normal control and symptom-free control mice. Colchicine and pentoxifylline treatment improved the symptoms of BD and increased the frequencies of CCR1 + cells in BD mice. Treatment with chemokine CC motif ligand 3 (CCL3), a ligand of CCR1, caused BD symptoms to deteriorate in 10 of 16 BD mice (62Á5%) via down-regulation of CCR1 + cells. Anti-CCL3 antibody treatment ameliorated BD symptoms in 10 of 20 mice (50%) and significantly decreased the disease severity score compared with CCL3-treated BD mice (P = 0Á01) via up-regulation of CCR1 + cell frequencies. In patients with BD, plasma levels of CCL3 in an active state were significantly higher than in healthy control individuals (P = 0Á02). These results show that the upregulation of CCR1 + cells was related to the control of systemic inflammation of BD in mouse models.
34a6261030342752871a70e35b236e3127e2077c	Predictive accuracy of surgical case duration plays a critical role in reducing cost of operation room (OR) utilization. The most common approaches used by hospitals rely on historic averages based on a specific surgeon or a specific procedure type obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR) scheduling systems. However, low predictive accuracy of EMR leads to negative impacts on patients and hospitals, such as rescheduling of surgeries and cancellation. In this study, we aim to improve prediction of operation case duration with advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms. We obtained a large data set containing 170,748 operation cases (from Jan 2017 to Dec 2019) from a hospital. The data covered a broad variety of details on patients, operations, specialties and surgical teams. Meanwhile, a more recent data with 8,672 cases (from Mar to Apr 2020) was also available to be used for external evaluation. We computed historic averages from EMR for surgeon-or procedure-specific and they were used as baseline models for comparison. Subsequently, we developed our models using linear regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms. All models were evaluated with R-squre (R 2 ), mean absolute error (M AE), and percentage overage (case duration > prediction + 10 % & 15 mins), underage (case duration < prediction -10 % & 15 mins) and within (otherwise). The XGB model was superior to the other models by having higher R 2 (85 %) and percentage within (48 %) as well as lower M AE (30.2 mins). The total prediction errors computed for all the models showed that the XGB model had the lowest inaccurate percent (23.7 %). As a whole, this study applied ML techniques in the field of OR scheduling to reduce medical and financial burden for healthcare management. It revealed the importance of operation and surgeon factors in operation case duration prediction. This study also demonstrated the importance of performing an external evaluation to better validate performance of ML models.

7aef491db611d58f82823cfa825e1280f506bcd8	The present work estimates the increased risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by establishing the linkage between the mortality rate in the infected cases and the air pollution, specifically Particulate Matters (PM) with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 10 µm and ≤ 2.5 µm. Data related to nine Asian cities are analyzed using statistical approaches, including the analysis of variance and regression model. The present work suggests that there exists a positive correlation between the level of air pollution of a region and the lethality related to COVID-19, indicating air pollution to be an elemental and concealed factor in aggravating the global burden of deaths related to COVID-19. Past exposures to high level of PM 2.5 over a long period, is found to significantly correlate with present COVID-19 mortality per unit reported cases (p < 0.05) compared to PM 10 , with non-significant correlation (p = 0.118). The finding of the study can help government agencies, health ministries and policymakers globally to take proactive steps by promoting immunity-boosting supplements and appropriate masks to reduce the risks associated with COVID-19 in highly polluted areas.

bb1bf4bae8552d1d5026529746f78d65eee3cebd	The COVID-19 is an issue of international concern and threat to public health and there is an urgent need of drug/vaccine design. There is no vaccine or specific drug yet made as of June 19, 2020, for the coronavirus disease . Thus, the patients currently can only be treated symptomatically. A quick identification of the drugs for COVID-19 may act as a potential therapeutic medication which has been used earlier in patients to answer the present pandemic condition before it could get more worse. According to our view, an artificial intelligence (AI) based tool that may predict drugs/peptides directly from the sequences of infected patients and thereby, they might have better affinity with the target and contribute towards vaccine design against COVID-19. Researchers across the world proposed several vaccines/drugs for COVID-19 utilizing AI based approaches, however, testing of these proposed vaccines/drugs will be needed to verify the safety and feasibility for combating COVID-19.

Dies kann durch neue Internet-Tools maßgeblich unterstützt werden, wenn sie beherrschbar und wirklich effizienzstiftend sind. Junge Teams haben dabei die Chance, die neuen Internet-Tools und die damit einhergehende, offene Kommunikation und Projektarbeit auch gleich in ihrer Arbeitskultur zu verankern. Verschiedene Internet-Tools können flexibel und kostengiinstig eingesetzt werden, um das Projekt-und Dokumentenmanagement, die Kommunikation und Präsentation sowie die Büro-und Finnenorganisation zu unterstützen. Das zentrale Ziel: eine verbesserte Zusammenarbeit bei minimierter Bürokratie im Unternehmen und nach außen mit Lieferanten, Partnern und Kunden. Grundvoraussetzungen sind jedoch eine moderne IT-Infrastruktur ("Ooud Computing") sowie eine offene Unternehmenskultur für eine transparente Inforrnationsund Kommunikationspolitik. Dies bedeutet für etablierte Unternehmen oft einen erheblichen Wandlungsprozess und bietet jungen Firmen somit die Chanoe, bei Organisation und Zusammenarbeit besser als die angestammten Mitbewerber zu sein. Kollaboration ist eines der großen Buzzwords der letzten Jahre. Alle Tätigkeiten, die auf Software-Anbieter preist seine kollaborativen Tools und Workflowsysteme an (vgl. Abbildung 7.1). In größeren Firmen stehen bei Kollaborationsprojekten in erster Linie Kosteneinsparungen, Effizienzsteigerungen und die Verbesserung der internen Prozesse innerhalb der Organisation im Vordergrund. In den 90er Jahren begannen Konzerne wie Motorola oder General Electric, mit einer internetbasierten Kollaboration zu experimentieren. Virtuelle Teams hieß das Schlagwort: Mitarbeiter an verschiedenen Standorten arbeiteten virtuell wie an einem Ort zusammen. Seit diesen Anfängen haben sich die Kollaborationstechniken weit fortentwickelt: Heute können Projektmitarbeiter aus der ganzen Welt zeitgleich über Videokonferenzen zugeschaltet werden. Dabei können sie gemeinsam Dokumente ansehen und bearbeiten ("Desktop Sharing") und über Zeit-und Länderzonen hinweg diskutieren.

14afebd7f8e62e95ff50453efb28983bca257cd5	Héma-Québec, the blood supplier in the Province of Quebec, Canada, collects and tests convalescent plasma used in a clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy of this product for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. So far, we have collected 1159 plasma units from 282 COVID-19 convalescent donors. The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times. This allowed us to perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in these repeat donors, with the first donation occurring 33-77 days after symptoms onset and donations up to 71-114 days after symptoms onset thereafter. In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821). This suggests that de novo secretion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies by short-lived plasma cells stopped about 2-3 months after disease onset, an observation that has important implications for convalescent plasma collection and seroprevalence studies undertaken several months after the peak of infection.

This work presents mEBAL 1 , a multimodal database for eye blink detection and attention level estimation. The eye blink frequency is related to the cognitive activity and automatic detectors of eye blinks have been proposed for many tasks including attention level estimation, analysis of neuro-degenerative diseases, deception recognition, drive fatigue detection, or face anti-spoofing. However, most existing databases and algorithms in this area are limited to experiments involving only a few hundred samples and individual sensors like face cameras. The proposed mEBAL improves previous databases in terms of acquisition sensors and samples. In particular, three different sensors are simultaneously considered: Near Infrared (NIR) and RGB cameras to capture the face gestures and an Electroencephalography (EEG) band to capture the cognitive activity of the user and blinking events. Regarding the size of mEBAL, it comprises 6,000 samples and the corresponding attention level from 38 different students while conducting a number of e-learning tasks of varying difficulty. In addition to presenting mEBAL, we also include preliminary experiments on: i) eye blink detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the facial images, and ii) attention level estimation of the students based on their eye blink frequency.
259ac67e44e833ea06564160ee399b76985f1145	Introduction: Sulfur mustard "bis (2-chlroethyl) sulphide" (SM) is a chemical warfare agent that remains a threat to human health. The aim of this study was to identify protein expression signature or biomarkers that reflect chronic lung damages induced by SM exposure. Methods: Prior to analysis, plasma was fractionated using ethanol precipitation. Using two dimensional SDS-PAGE; fractionated protein profiles of 20 healthy and 20 exposed patients with lung diseases were established. Selected protein spots were successfully identified with MALDI TOF MS/MS. Results: The results show that α1 haptoglobin isoforms were detected in plasma of the all lung disease patients but none of the healthy controls. Amyloid A1 isoforms was also detected in plasma of the lung disease patients but none of the healthy controls. Moreover, low molecular weight proteins were enriched in ethanol supernatant compared to ethanol precipitate. Conclusion: Our present results and previous studies suggest that ongoing tissue remodeling is involved in SM exposed lung damage patients. These finding might improve patient care and suitable therapies.

810666fbfad6b278f9c51168089cbb7c198fabbc	Recent progress has been made in the production of higher alcohols by harnessing the power of natural amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Here, we describe the first strain of Escherichia coli developed to produce the higher alcohol and potential new biofuel 2-methyl-1butanol (2MB). To accomplish this, we explored the biodiversity of enzymes catalyzing key parts of the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, finding that AHAS II (ilvGM) from Salmonella typhimurium and threonine deaminase (ilvA) from Corynebacterium glutamicum improve 2MB production the most. Overexpression of the native threonine biosynthetic operon (thrABC) on plasmid without the native transcription regulation also improved 2MB production in E. coli. Finally, we knocked out competing pathways upstream of threonine production (ΔmetA, Δtdh) to increase its availability for further improvement of 2MB production. This work led to a strain of E. coli that produces 1.25 g/L 2MB in 24 h, a total alcohol content of 3 g/L, and with yields of up to 0.17 g 2MB/g glucose.
a61f3b09aff9e066b7996f5c3937792419a4f935	Cancer is the first cause of death by disease in childhood globally. The most frequent types of cancers in children and adolescents are leukemias, followed by brain and central nervous system tumors and lymphomas. The recovery rate of cancer in children is around 80% in developed countries and up to 30% in developing countries. Some of the main causes of complications in children and adolescents with cancer are respiratory viral infections, mainly in bone marrow-transplanted patients. Respiratory viruses have been detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage or nasal wash specimens from cancer patients with or without respiratory illness symptoms. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is within the ten most common viruses that are encountered in samples from pediatric patients with underlying oncology conditions. In most of cases, HMPV is found as the only viral agent, but co-infection with other viruses or with bacterial agents has also been reported. The discrepancies between the most prevalent viral agents may be due to the different populations studied or the range of viral agents tested. Some of the cases of infection with HMPV in cancer patients have been fatal, especially in those who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This review seeks to show a general view of the participation of HMPV in respiratory illness as a complication of cancer in childhood and adolescence. Keywords: pediatric cancer infections; HMPV; fatal cases in HSCT patients Cancer is the first cause of death by disease in children around the world. The five-year rate of survival of children who have cancer is up to 80% in developed countries, but for developing countries, the survival rate is less than 30% [1]. According to a study based in cancer registries from 52 countries, the types of cancer in childhood (0-19 years old) during 2001-2010 were leukemia, lymphoma, central nervous system tumors, sympathetic nervous system tumors, retinoblastoma, renal tumors, hepatic tumors, bone tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, germ cell and gonadal tumors, epithelial tumors, and melanomas. The most frequent cancers in children of 0-14 years are leukemia, followed by lymphoma; meanwhile, for the ages of 15-19, the most prevalent is lymphoma, followed by leukemia [2] . Cancer in childhood comprises only 1% of the total cancer cases worldwide; however, it has a dramatic impact. Recently the years of life lost due to cancer in childhood (0-19 years old) were calculated with global cancer registries in 2017, with a result of more than 11 million years [3] .
c9708301ac6326b1214f31ab93fcd4b72485cf4b	, the active isoform of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), is a key regulator of UPR. Previously, we showed that a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), binds to XBP-1S and functions as an activator of XBP-1S. Here, we identify general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), a HAT with 73% identity to PCAF, as a novel XBP-1S regulator. Both PCAF and GCN5 bind to the same domain of XBP-1S. Surprisingly, GCN5 potently blocks the XBP-1Smediated transcription, including cellular UPR genes and latent membrane protein 1 of Epstein-Barr virus. Unlike PCAF, GCN5 acetylates XBP-1S and enhances nuclear retention and protein stability of XBP-1S. However, such GCN5-mediated acetylation of XBP-1S shows no effects on XBP-1S activity. In addition, the HAT activity of GCN5 is not required for repression of XBP-1S target genes. We further demonstrate that GCN5 inhibits XBP-1S-mediated transcription by disrupting the PCAF-XBP-1S interaction and preventing the recruitment of XBP-1S to its target genes. Taken together, our results represent the first work demonstrating that GCN5 and PCAF exhibit different functions and antagonistically regulate the XBP-1S-mediated transcription. Oncotarget 272
988eb76f99bdb20992a35c3e9e5bdcd5105d58e5	Rotaviruses are a major cause of viral gastroenteritis in children. For accurate and sensitive detection of rotavirus RNA from stool samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the extraction process must be robust. However, some extraction methods may not remove the strong RT-PCR inhibitors known to be present in stool samples. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of six extraction methods used commonly for extraction of rotavirus RNA from stool, which have never been formally evaluated: the MagNA Pure Compact, KingFisher Flex and NucliSENS ® easyMAG ® instruments, the NucliSENS ® miniMAG ® semi-automated system, and two manual purification kits, the QIAamp Viral RNA kit and a modified RNaid ® kit. Using each method, total nucleic acid or RNA was extracted from eight rotavirus-positive stool samples with enzyme immunoassay optical density (EIA OD) values ranging from 0.176 to 3.098. Extracts prepared using the MagNA Pure Compact instrument yielded the most consistent results by qRT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. When extracts prepared from a dilution series were extracted by the 6 methods and tested, rotavirus RNA was detected in all samples by qRT-PCR but by conventional RT-PCR testing, only the MagNA Pure Compact and King-Fisher Flex extracts were positive in all cases. RT-PCR inhibitors were detected in extracts produced with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. The findings of this study should prove useful for selection of extraction methods to be incorporated into future rotavirus detection and genotyping protocols. Published by Elsevier B.V.

9c777e074b675d95be1c1da2790a788038c13e69	All cells of the immune system rely on a highly integrated and dynamic gene expression program that is controlled by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Recently, noncoding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in diverse biological contexts. Long non-coding RNAs control gene expression in the nucleus by modulating transcription or via post-transcriptional mechanisms targeting the splicing, stability or translation of mRNAs. Our knowledge of lncRNA biogenesis, their cell-type specific expressions, and their versatile molecular functions are rapidly progressing in all areas of biology. Here we discuss these exciting new regulators and highlight an emerging paradigm of lncRNA-mediated control of gene expression in the immune system. The immune system is equipped with an arsenal of strategies to combat infectious threats and maintain normal health. This is mediated by specialized immune cells dedicated to carrying out sophisticated and highly integrated functions of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The development and activation state of immune cells is dependent on a tightly regulated and integrated gene expression program controlled by well-established transcription factors and chromatin modifying complexes. Our knowledge of the functional roles of proteins in the transcriptional, and posttranscriptional, regulation of gene expression is fairly well developed; however, we have only begun to appreciate the fundamental roles of regulatory RNAs in controlling all facets of gene expression. Regulatory RNAs are non-protein-coding transcripts that mediate their functions strictly as RNA molecules [1] . Some of these including small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar

In consequence, use of opioids seemed to be less frequent than in patients with solid tumours. Measures of intensive care and i.v.drug administration were applied to a significant proportion of patients. Conclusion The present investigation indicates that the somatic, psychic and spiritual end-of-life-care after allogeneic stem cell transplantation could be optimised. A significant problem for the transplantation team seems to be the realisation of necessity to switch the curative concept into a palliative ambition. Requirements are a subsequent prospectively conducted investigation and an intensification of cooperation between transplant and palliative care teams. Keywords Allogeneic stem cell transplantation · Complications · End of life care · Palliative care Purpose Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may cure approximately 50% of patients, however, a significant part of the other half might benefit from a high-quality palliative care medicine at the end of life. Somatic, psychic and spiritual needs of these patients may differ from those of patients suffering from incurable solid tumours and are not comprehensively evaluated so far. Methods To address this question, data from charts of 123 patients who have died after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were extracted. In detail, the time line of the clinical course, the symptoms, the administered drugs and other applied procedures were analysed. Results Approximately one half of the patients, who have died after stem cell transplantation, did not live more than 5 months. Two-thirds of patients died within 14 months after SCT. 28.5% of the patients could not be discharged after transplantation. However, a significant proportion had a low ECOG-score (0-1) prior to death, indicating a high degree of mobility. Major symptoms were weakness, fatigue and need for aid at daily activities. Severe pain, Christoph Busemann and Andreas Jülich contributed equally to this work.
77ca3e5704b337097c2eacf39054697292986341	Background: In Hong Kong Emergency Departments (EDs), the timeliness of providing highquality services has been compromised by the increasing attendance of non-emergent patients in addition to the unpredictable arrival of emergency patients. Objectives: We sought to quantify the impact of the presence of emergent patients and other related factors on the delay in service for non-emergent patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in patients who visited the ED of a large hospital in Hong Kong from . We estimated waiting and length of stay (LOS) for individual non-emergent patients registered during day and evening shifts. Using multiple linear regression, we estimated waiting time and LOS as a function of the presence of emergent patients and other related factors such as patient demographics and clinical factors. In particular, we evaluated the influence of the arrival or presence of emergent patients on the odds of violating the 120-min waiting time target for semi-urgent patients. Results: The arrival of a new emergent patient prolonged the waiting time and LOS of a nonemergent patient by 14.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.2-15.5) and 10.8% (95% CI 10.6-11.0), respectively. An additional patient-hour needed for an emergent patient increased the probability of violating the waiting time target for non-emergent patients (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 2.2-2.4). Conclusions: The arrival of an emergent patient significantly prolonged the waiting time and LOS for nonemergent patients. Discouraging non-urgent ED utilization and building a real-time decision-support system are critical methods needed to relieve staff pressure and guide contingent resource reallocation when emergent patients arrive.

b419ea900da16b40a8ae3316c9828371607c3c4f	Objective: to explore and examine the relationship between maternal anxiety levels and feelings of control during labour among Hong Kong Chinese first-time pregnant women. Design: an exploratory descriptive correlation design. Data were collected on three occasions: during latent phase of labour, during active phase of labour and within 24-48 hrs after delivery. Setting: an obstetric unit of a public teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Participants: a convenience sample of 90 Hong Kong Chinese first-time mothers. Measurements and findings: the Labour Agentry Scale (LAS) is a self-report scale designed to measure feelings of control during childbirth. A Visual Analogue Scale for anxiety (VAS-A) was used to measure women's self-reported level of anxiety during labour. Pearson Product Moment Correlation coefficient test indicated a significant negative relationship between the feelings of control and maternal anxiety during labour. No statistical relationships were detected between women's attendance at antenatal classes and feelings of control during labour. Key conclusions: the study showed a significant negative relationship between maternal anxiety and feelings of control during labour. Implications for practice: midwives should work with women to enhance their personal control during labour and satisfaction with their birth. The insignificant relationship between attendance at antenatal classes and feelings of control suggests the need to evaluate the content of childbirth education in order to empower women's control during labour.
f266819e70ed8483af5b96c89c7ba3bda6997d30	Abstract Around 200 million people suffer gastroenteritis daily and more than 2 million people die annually in developing countries due to such pathologies. Vaccination is an alternative to control this global health issue, however new low-cost vaccines are needed to ensure proper vaccine coverage. In this context, plants are attractive hosts for the synthesis and delivery of subunit vaccines. Therefore, in this study a plant-made multiepitopic protein named LTBentero containing epitopes from antigens of enterotoxigenic E. coli, S. typhimurium, and V. parahaemolyticus was produced and found immunogenic in mice. The LTBentero protein was expressed in tobacco plants at up to 5.29 µg g −1 fresh leaf tissue and was deemed immunogenic when administered to BALB/c mice either orally or subcutaneously. The plant-made LTBentero antigen induced specific IgG (systemic) and IgA (mucosal) responses against LTB, ST, and LptD epitopes. In conclusion, multiepitopic LTBentero was functionally produced in plant cells, being capable to trigger systemic and intestinal humoral responses and thus it constitutes a promising oral immunogen candidate in the fight against enteric diseases.

efd6ea1e3d5223f220c6c09084ac5fb043618b03	To investigate the potential of adeno-associated viruses serotype 2 (AAV2)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as an antiviral agent against rabies, recombinant AAV2 vectors expressing siRNA targeting the nucleoprotein (N) gene of rabies virus (RAbV) (rAAV-N796) were constructed and evaluated. When NA cells pretreated with rAAV-N796 were challenged with RAbV, there was a 37.8 ± 3.4% to 55.1 ± 5.3% reduction in RAbV virus titer. When cells pre-challenged with RAbV were treated with rAAV-N796, there was a 4.4 ± 1.4 to 28.8 ± 3.2% reduction in RABV virus titer. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR and Western blot revealed that the knockdown of RAbV-N gene transcripts was based on the rAAV-N796 inoculation titer. When any NA cells were treated with rAAV-N796 before or after challenged with RABV, significant reduction in virus titer was observed in both administrations. Mice treated intracerebrally with rAAV-N796 exhibited 50 ± 5.3 and 62.5 ± 4.7% protection when challenged intracerebrally or intramuscally, respectively, with lethal RAbV. When mice treated intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 were challenged intramuscularly with lethal RAbV, they exhibited 37.5 ± 3.7% protection. When mice were intracerebrally and intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 24 hr after exposure to RAbV infection, they exhibited 25 ± 4.1% protection The N gene mRNA levels in the brains of challenged mice with three different administrations were reduced (55, 68, 32 and 25%, respectively). These results indicated that AAV2 vector-mediated siRNA delivery in vitro in NA cells inhibited RAbV multiplication, inhibited RAbV multiplication in vivo in the mice brain and imparted partial protection against lethal rabies. So, it may have a potential to be used as an alternative antiviral approach against rabies.
c56e3599cec6dd5161af736e9d9cbd0e58c86315	ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase which generates Angiotensin (1-7) from Angiotensin II (1-8). Attempts to target the kidney Renin Angiotensin System using native ACE2 to treat kidney disease are hampered by its large molecular size, 100 kDa, which precludes its glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular uptake. Here, we show that both urine and kidney lysates are capable of digesting native ACE2 into shorter proteins of~60-75 kDa and then demonstrate that they are enzymatically very active. We then truncated the native ACE2 by design from the C-terminus to generate two short recombinant (r)ACE2 variants (1-605 and 1-619AA). These two truncates have a molecular size of~70 kDa, as expected from the amino acid sequence and as shown by Western blot. ACE2 enzyme activity, measured using a specific substrate, was higher than that of the native rACE2 (1-740 AA). When infused to mice with genetic ACE2 deficiency, a single i.v. injection of 1-619 resulted in detectable ACE2 activity in urine, whereas infusion of the native ACE2 did not. Moreover, ACE2 activity was recovered in harvested kidneys from ACE2-deficient mice infused with 1-619, but not in controls (23.1 ± 4.3 RFU/µg creatinine/h and 1.96 ± 0.73 RFU/µg protein/hr, respectively). In addition, the kidneys of ACE2-null mice infused with 1-619 studied ex vivo formed more Ang (1-7) from exogenous Ang II than those infused with vehicle (AUC 8555 ± 1933 vs. 3439 ± 753 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.05) further demonstrating the functional effect of increasing kidney ACE2 activity after the infusion of our short ACE2 1-619 variant. We conclude that our novel short recombinant ACE2 variants undergo glomerular filtration, which is associated with kidney uptake of enzymatically active proteins that can enhance the formation of Ang (1-7) from Ang II. These small ACE2 variants may offer a potentially useful approach to target kidney RAS overactivity to combat kidney injury.
f61b078f024a2fbd4f3992799d75773f83e903d1	SARS-CoV-2 has recently been detected in feces, which indicates that wastewater may be used to monitor viral prevalence in the community. Here we use RT-qPCR to monitor wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over a 52-day time course. We show that changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations correlate with local COVID-19 epidemiological data (R 2 =0.9), though detection in wastewater trails symptom onset dates by 5-8 days. We determine a near complete (98.5%) SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from the wastewater and use phylogenic analysis to infer viral ancestry. Collectively, this work demonstrates how wastewater can be used as a proxy to monitor viral prevalence in the community and how genome sequencing can be used for high-resolution genotyping of the predominant strains circulating in a community.
12de52d9061626d8f163666f7da428b9cb7c94c2	Immune responses combat various infectious agents by inducing inflammatory responses, antimicrobial pathways and adaptive immunity. The polygenic responses to these external stimuli are temporally and coordinately regulated. Specific lncRNAs are induced to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses which can function through various target interactions like RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, and RNA-protein interaction and hence affect the immunogenic regulation at various stages of gene expression. LncRNA are found to be present in various immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T cells and B cells. They have been shown to be involved in many biological processes, including the regulation of the expression of genes, the dosage compensation and genomics imprinting, but the knowledge how lncRNAs are regulated and how they alter cell differentiation/function is still obscure. Further dysregulation of lncRNA has been seen in many diseases, but as yet very less research has been carried out to understand the role of lncRNAs in regulation during host-pathogens interactions. In this review, we summarize the functional developments and mechanism of action of lncRNAs, in immunity and defense of host against pathogens.
0113b9a8d82039e8474e887038d643853b5fdfeb	Background: The Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) in Sierra Leone partially rolled out the implementation of Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) in 2003. After the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014-2015, there was need to strengthen IDSR to ensure prompt detection and response to epidemic-prone diseases. We describe the processes, successes and challenges of revitalizing public health surveillance in a country recovering from a protracted Ebola virus disease outbreak. Methods: The revitalization process began with adaptation of the revised IDSR guidelines and development of customized guidelines to suit the health care systems in Sierra Leone. Public health experts defined data flow, system operations, case definitions, frequency and channels of reporting and dissemination. Next, phased training of IDSR focal persons in each health facility and the distribution of data collection and reporting tools was done. Monitoring activities included periodic supportive supervision and data quality assessments. Rapid response teams were formed to investigate and respond to disease outbreak alerts in all districts. Results: Submission of reports through the IDSR system began in mid-2015 and by the 35th epidemiologic week, all district health teams were submitting reports. The key performance indicators measuring the functionality of the IDSR system in 2016 and 2017 were achieved (WHO Africa Region target ≥80%); the annual average proportion of timely weekly health facility reports submitted to the next level was 93% in 2016 and 97% in 2017; the proportion of suspected outbreaks and public health events detected through the IDSR system was 96% (n = 87) in 2016 and 100% (n = 85) in 2017. Conclusion: With proper planning, phased implementation and adequate investment of resources, it is possible to establish a functional IDSR system in a country recovering from a public health crisis. A functional IDSR system requires well trained workforce, provision of the necessary tools and guidelines, information, communication and technology infrastructure to support data transmission, provision of timely feedback as well as logistical support.
9fd239d4c0a77ad8117c758f61ea0de9a5af3031	Risk is our daily work and often our obsession -as risk researchers we are working on research projects which are intended to increase our knowledge about all aspects of risks. Being a "risk researcher" means looking at things through a specific perspective -the perspective of what negative consequences a natural or man-made event, a technology, a decision could probably have on the world we live in. Our perspective is a socio-scientific one. This means, we are analyzing what consequences do risks have on the society and what can we do to decrease or prevent them. This includes the possible actions of a single consumer as well as strategies of whole governments to manage risks. How are risks perceived by people? What kinds of knowledge are needed to deal with different kinds of risks? Who should be involved, and when? What to do if conflicts evolve about how to handle risks? How to communicate risks? It is our job to answer questions like these. We are dealing with these questions in many different thematic areas: food safety, climate change, chemicals, nanotechnology, electromagnetic fields, etc. These risks pose very different problems and it seems difficult to find general strategies to deal with them. This first part of the book is meant to set the stage for the following chapters: We want to convey insights into current risk research on a general level, before diving into the more thematically specialized chapters of the book. This means, we illustrate what you need to know on risks and how to handle them with examples of our daily life and give you a broad picture of the different aspects of risk research. This knowledge will form the basis to guide you through the three remaining thematic chapters, where more targeted strategies of dealing with different types of risks are presented. The following section of the chapter will inform you about what risk is and what characteristics, concepts, and perceptions of risk exist. Section 3 introduces
de7deda31a9a1ec0fea9ace86abc8dfc790f6fd5	Background: Theaflavins are major polyphenols in black tea which is the most widely consumed tea in the world. They possess a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and cardio-protective effects. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of theaflavin on glycoprotein content and tricorboxylic acid cycle enzymes in high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats as there was no study on this aspect. Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding them with high-fat diet and injecting them intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (40 mg/kg b.wt). Results: Different doses of theaflavin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg b.wt /day) were administered orally to high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 30 days for fixing the glucose lowering dose. However, the dose at 100 mg/kg b.wt showed a significant reduction in the levels of plasma glucose and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance with concomitant elevation of insulin when compared to the other two doses (25 and 50 mg/kg b.wt). Hence, 100 mg/kg b.wt was fixed as an effective dose and used for further analysis. Theaflavin administration restored the altered glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin and glycoproteins (Hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid) and TCA cycle enzymes (isocitrate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase) near the normal levels by correcting hyperglycemia. Improved histological changes were observed in the pancreas of diabetic rats upon treatment with theaflavin which supported the biochemicals investigated. Conclusion: The effect produced by the theaflavin on various parameters was comparable to that of metformin-a reference antidiabetic drug. These findings suggest that theaflavin can replace the commercial drugs which could lead to reduction in toxicity and side effect caused by the later as well as reduce the secondary completions.
de45c0fb4263dda95f48b9bb7fca75fcf89dd93e	a b s t r a c t RNA replication of positive-strand ( þ)RNA viruses requires the lipids present in intracellular membranes, the sites of which viral replicases associate with. However, the direct effects of membrane lipids on viral replicases are still poorly understood. Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV) protein A, which associates with mitochondrial membranes, is the sole replicase required for RNA replication. Here, we report that WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane lipids (MMLs) stimulated the RNA binding activity and cooperativity of protein A, and such stimulations exhibited strong selectivity for distinct phospholipids. Interestingly, MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding cooperativity only at higher protein A concentrations. Further investigation showed that MMLs stimulate the RNA binding of protein A by promoting its self-interaction. Finally, manipulating MML metabolism affected the protein A-induced RNA1 recruitment in cells. Together, our findings reveal the direct effects of membrane lipids on the RNA binding activity of a nodaviral replicase.
28a80a559e2e3282b8009f5c146e8d894fb22e99	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes vary from asymptomatic infection to 33 death. This disparity may reflect different airway levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, 34 ACE2, and the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2. Here we explore the role of genetics 35 and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the 36 analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression 37 quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency 38 across world populations. Importantly, we find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory 39 network, highly upregulated by T2 inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and 40 that interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. 41 Finally, we define airway responses to coronavirus infections in children, finding that 42 these infections upregulate IL6 while also stimulating a more pronounced cytotoxic 43 immune response relative to other respiratory viruses. Our results reveal mechanisms 44 likely influencing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. 45 46 47 48 49
c5ff66ecd15e6956073e57a2ecfb7b06f6f6fba6	Objective To assess site variability and concomitant respiratory support related to the timing of caffeine discontinuation, and compare clinical characteristics of infants who discontinued caffeine before vs. within the last week of hospitalization. Study design Cohort study of 81,110 infants <35 weeks gestational age and <1500 g birth weight discharged from 304 neonatal intensive care units from 2001-2016. Results The mean postmenstrual age at caffeine discontinuation ranged from 32 to 37 weeks among sites. Respiratory support at the time of discontinuation was common, but variable, with 0-57% of infants receiving positive airway pressure at caffeine discontinuation by site. Infants who discontinued caffeine within the last week of hospitalization had longer total duration of caffeine, but were discharged from the hospital at an earlier postmenstrual age. Conclusion There was substantial variability among sites in the timing of caffeine discontinuation before discharge and respiratory support at the time of caffeine discontinuation.
f5080088701ed43effa979603627b2a3ad53d5aa	Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are constantly exposed to commensal flora and pathogen challenges. How IECs regulate their innate immune response to maintain gut homeostasis remains unclear. Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines produced during infections. While type I IFN receptors are ubiquitously expressed, type III IFN receptors are expressed only on epithelial cells. This epithelium specificity strongly suggests exclusive functions at epithelial surfaces, but the relative roles of type I and III IFNs in the establishment of an antiviral innate immune response in human IECs are not clearly defined. Here, we used mini-gut organoids to define the functions of types I and III IFNs to protect the human gut against viral infection. We show that primary non-transformed human IECs, upon viral challenge, upregulate the expression of both type I and type III IFNs at the transcriptional level but only secrete type III IFN in the supernatant. However, human IECs respond to both type I and type III IFNs by producing IFN-stimulated genes that in turn induce an antiviral state. Using genetic ablation of either type I or type III IFN receptors, we show that either IFN can independently restrict virus infection in human IECs. Importantly, we report, for the first time, differences in the mechanisms by which each IFN establishes the antiviral state. Contrary to type I IFN, the antiviral activity induced by type III IFN is strongly dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway, suggesting a pathway used by type III IFNs that non-redundantly contributes to the antiviral state. In conclusion, we demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells specifically regulate their innate immune response favoring type III IFN-mediated signaling, which allows for efficient protection against pathogens without producing excessive inflammation. Our results strongly suggest that type III IFN constitutes the frontline of antiviral response in the human gut. We propose that mucosal surfaces, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, have evolved to favor type III IFN-mediated response to pathogen infections as it allows for spatial segregation of signaling and moderate production of inflammatory signals which we propose are key to maintain gut homeostasis.
7274f439641a1f4dc180a94cafe9b69d37e60415	We investigated whether small RNA (sRNA) sequenced from field-collected mosquitoes and chironomids (Diptera) can be used as a proxy signature of viral prevalence within a range of species and viral groups, using sRNAs sequenced from wild-caught specimens, to inform total RNA deep sequencing of samples of particular interest. Using this strategy, we sequenced from adult Anopheles maculipennis s.l. mosquitoes the apparently nearly complete genome of one previously undescribed virus related to chronic bee paralysis virus, and, from a pool of Ochlerotatus caspius and Oc. detritus mosquitoes, a nearly complete entomobirnavirus genome. We also reconstructed long sequences (1503-6557 nt) related to at least nine other viruses. Crucially, several of the sequences detected were reconstructed from host organisms highly divergent from those in which related viruses have been previously isolated or discovered. It is clear that viral transmission and maintenance cycles in nature are likely to be significantly more complex and taxonomically diverse than previously expected.
e7f5a29c5a8b04b195313b6ff79294bbb3fbb452	In this retrospective study, chest CTs of 121 symptomatic patients infected with coronavirus were reviewed for common CT findings in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial CT scan (i.e. early, 0-2 days (36 patients), intermediate 3-5 days (33 patients), late 6-12 days (25 patients)). The hallmarks of COVID-19 infection on imaging were bilateral and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities. Notably, 20/36 (56%) of early patients had a normal CT. With a longer time after the onset of symptoms, CT findings were more frequent, including consolidation, bilateral and peripheral disease, greater total lung involvement, linear opacities, "crazy-paving" pattern and the "reverse halo" sign. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 10/36 early patients (28%), 25/33 intermediate patients (76%), and 22/25 late patients (88%).
60259832419f6dc978fb6dda361958c52bd43061	Similar to species immigration or exotic species invasion, infectious disease transmission is strengthened due to the globalization of human activities. Using schistosomiasis as an example, we propose a conceptual model simulating the spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. We base the model on the knowledge of the interrelationship among the source, media, and the hosts of the disease. With the endemics data of schistosomiasis in Xichang, China, we demonstrate that the conceptual model is feasible; we introduce how remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques can be used in support of spatio-temporal modeling; we compare the different effects caused to the entire population when selecting different groups of people for schistosomiasis control. Our work illustrates the importance of such a modeling tool in supporting spatial decisions. Our modeling method can be directly applied to such infectious diseases as the plague, lyme disease, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The application of remote sensing and geographic information systems can shed light on the modeling of other infectious disease and invasive species studies.
6bd5afed188ed38713858798c37d54e319249c08	The dataset investigates the magnitude of the misinformation content influencing scepticisms about the novel COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. The data is collected via an electronic questionnaire method and twenty-one Africa countries randomly participated. Responses were received from all the five regions of Africa. The data is structured to identify some leading misinformation been propagated in the media. For data, in brief, we performed a descriptive analysis of the data and also examine the degree of each selected misinformation content on the immune perception of respondents using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Another research can use the dataset to investigate how misinformation and religion misconception promote ignorance about disease or pandemic in Africa or the dataset could serve as supplementary material for further investigation of COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.
a0aefbe28a2f036d977d34afb4d9d490d10b58a2	Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread rapidly worldwide and seriously threatens human health since December 2019. However, information about acute kidney injury (AKI) during COVID-19 infection is limited. Some studies thought that presence of AKI is very common and cannot be ignored, while some studies pointed that AKI only is a rare incident during COVID-19 infection. This meta-analysis aimed to find out the truth of COVID-19 related AKI and to provide stronger evidence. Two authors independently performed a literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library fulfilled the pre-specified criteria until April 25, 2020 to include studies reported the necessary clinic characteristics, then the incidence of AKI, incidence of required RRT, the mortality with AKI and the death risk with AKI during COVID-19 infection were pooled for statistical analysis by Open Meta-Analyst software to get conclusions. Findings: It was found that the incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection is low, only about 3.8%; the in-hospital mortality with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is reach up to 32.6%; the death risk with AKI in COVID-19 infected patients is about 16.1 times higher than those without AKI. This meta-analysis indicated AKI during COVID-19 infection should be pay more attention, it maybe a strong red flag to death risk. It is still need additional studies to support the conclusions and to explore the AKI mechanism during COVID-19 infection.
12a3a774cc0d58a6e35a0d7fb71074af088e7c3e	Translation control is crucial during virus-host interaction. On one hand, viruses completely rely on the protein synthesis machinery of host cells to propagate and have evolved various mechanisms to redirect the host's ribosomes toward their viral mRNAs. On the other hand, the host rewires its translation program in an attempt to contain and suppress the virus early on during infection; the antiviral program includes specific control on protein synthesis to translate several antiviral mRNAs involved in quenching the infection. As the infection progresses, host translation is in turn inhibited in order to limit viral propagation. We have learnt of very diverse strategies that both parties utilize to gain or retain control over the protein synthesis machinery. Yet novel strategies continue to be discovered, attesting for the importance of mRNA translation in virus-host interaction. This review focuses on recently described translation strategies employed by both hosts and viruses. These discoveries provide additional pieces in the understanding of the complex virus-host translation landscape.
9d77f5c67963a68f5ede5bf53e95fdb03270fd2b	The ability of fd bacteriophage particles to trigger different arms of the immune system has been previously shown by us with particular emphasis on the ability of phages to raise CTL responses in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that fd virions in the absence of adjuvants are able to evoke a DTH reaction mediated by antigen specific CD8+ T cells. In addition, we analyzed the induction of CTL responses in mice depleted of CD4+ T cells, and we observed that short-term secondary CTL responses were induced in the absence of CD4+ T cells while induction of long-term memory CTLs required the presence of CD4+ T lymphocytes. These results examine the cellular mechanism at the basis of fd efficiency and provide new elements to further validate the use of fd particles for eliciting and monitoring antigen-specific CTLs.
1d9529d3a101773ad158072a13e23db5ea3f0054	Humanitarian disasters have been on the rise in recent years due to the effects of climate change and socio-political situations such as the refugee crisis. Technology can be used to best mobilize resources such as food and water in the event of a natural disaster, by semi-automatically flagging tweets and short messages as indicating an urgent need. The problem is challenging not just because of the sparseness of data in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, but because of the varying characteristics of disasters in developing countries (making it difficult to train just one system) and the noise and quirks in social media. In this paper, we present a robust, low-supervision social media urgency system that adapts to arbitrary crises by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in an ensemble setting. The system is also able to adapt to new crises where an unlabeled background corpus may not be available yet by utilizing a simple and effective transfer learning methodology. Experimentally, our transfer learning and low-supervision approaches are found to outperform viable baselines with high significance on myriad disaster datasets.
d21572371b453614216038841774cd728455fe38	a b s t r a c t Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is one of the major viral pathogens causing disease in farmed Atlantic salmon worldwide. In the present work we show that several of the IPN proteins have powerful antagonistic properties against type I IFN induction in Atlantic salmon. Each of the five IPNV genes cloned into an expression vector were tested for the ability to influence activation of the Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter by the interferon promoter inducing protein one (IPS-1) or interferon regulatory factors (IRF). This showed that preVP2, VP3 and VP5 inhibited activation of both promoters, while VP4 only antagonized activation of the IFNa1 promoter. The viral protease VP4 was the most potent inhibitor of IFN induction, apparently targeting the IRF1 and IRF3 branch of the signaling cascade. VP4 antagonism is independent of its protease activity since the catalytically dead mutant VP4K674A inhibited activation of the IFNa1 promoter to a similar extent as wild type VP4. In contrast to the other IPNV proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 activated the IFNa1 promoter. The ability to activate the IFN response was disrupted in the mutant VP1S163A, which has lost the ability to produce dsRNA. VP1 also exhibited synergistic effects with IRF1 and IRF3 in inducing an IFNa1-dependent antiviral state in cells. Taken together these results suggest that IPNV has developed multiple IFN antagonistic properties to prevent IFN-induction by VP1 and its dsRNA genome.
7e66156dbf794b7cca88b5c1b46f3a121b9c18ba	The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world to its core and has provoked an overnight exodus of developers that normally worked in an office setting to working from home. The magnitude of this shift and the factors that have accompanied this new unplanned work setting go beyond what the software engineering community has previously understood to be remote work. To find out how developers and their productivity were affected, we distributed two surveys (with 3,634 responses)-weeks apart to understand the presence and prevalence of the benefits, challenges, and opportunities to improve this special circumstance of remote work. From our thematic qualitative analysis and statistical quantitative analysis, we find that there is a dichotomy of developer experiences influenced by many different factors (that for some are a benefit, while for others a challenge). For example, a benefit for some was being close to family members but for others having family members share their working space and interrupting their focus, was a challenge. Our surveys led to powerful narratives from respondents and revealed the scale at which these experiences exist to provide insights as to how the future of (pandemic) remote work can evolve.
ddb5564780f271d34bca4ec8b1a1647a61a6a1a4	This article revisits the prediction, made in 2010, that the 2010-2020 decade would likely be a period of growing instability in the United States and Western Europe Turchin P. 2018. This prediction was based on a computational model that quantified in the USA such structural-demographic forces for instability as popular immiseration, intraelite competition, and state weakness prior to 2010. Using these trends as inputs, the model calculated and projected forward in time the Political Stress Indicator, which in the past was strongly correlated with socio-political instability. Ortmans et al. Turchin P. 2010 conducted a similar structuraldemographic study for the United Kingdom. Here we use the Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive for the US, UK, and several major Western European countries to assess these structural-demographic predictions. We find that such measures of socio-political instability as anti-government demonstrations and riots increased dramatically during the 2010-2020 decade in all of these countries.

4b92d46245d381baf3f129821749af720d65e34d	In early 2020, cities across China enacted strict social distancing measures to contain emerging coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks. We estimated the speed with which these measures contained community transmission in each of 58 Chinese cities. On average, containment was achieved 7.83 days (SD 6.79 days) after the implementation of social distancing interventions, with an average reduction in the reproduction number ( R t ) of 54.3% (SD 17.6%) over that time period. A single day delay in the implementation of social distancing led to a 2.41 (95% CI: 0.97, 3.86) day delay in containment. Swift social distancing interventions may thus achieve rapid containment of newly emerging COVID-19 outbreaks.
d9461d15391d6a3dcfc64446d5841c15e2818fb6	The first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in December 2019. Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data. Results: hCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of ~2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires less than 20mn on our cluster. Moreover, COVID-Align provides summary statistics, which can be used to determine the sequencing quality and evolutionary novelty of input genomes (e.g. number of new mutations and indels).

1e589559db60e302b6b89f8793cef61207496b07	Respiratory virus infections (RVIs) pose a threat to children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this era of sensitive molecular diagnostics, the incidence and outcome of HSCT recipients who are hospitalized with RVI (H-RVI) are not well described. A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric HSCT recipients (between January 2010 and June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Their medical charts were reviewed for H-RVI events within 1 year after their transplant. An H-RVI diagnosis required respiratory signs or symptoms plus viral detection (human rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronaviruses, and/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of H-RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline HSCT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. Results. Among 1560 HSCT recipients, 259 (16.6%) acquired at least 1 H-RVI within 1 year after their transplant. The median age of the patients with an H-RVI was lower than that of patients without an H-RVI (4.8 vs 7.1 years; P < .001). Among the patients with a first H-RVI, 48% required some respiratory support, and 14% suffered significant pulmonary sequelae. The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of H-RVI onset were 11% and 5.4%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that H-RVI onset within 60 days of HSCT, steroid use in the 7 days before H-RVI onset, and the need for respiratory support at H-RVI onset were associated with subsequent morbidity or death. Conclusion. Results of this multicenter cohort study suggest that H-RVIs are relatively common in pediatric HSCT recipients and contribute to significant morbidity and death. These data should help inform interventional studies specific to each viral pathogen.
2f643f505d6e6e9290c8ee55a22fdecc9d26f2ba	Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic may leave many people behind through a variety of exclusion processes as basic information about the virus and its spread is shared with the public. We conduct a rapid virtual audit of pandemic related press briefings and press conferences issued by governments and international organizations in order to assess if responses have been inclusive to the hearing-impaired communities in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). We analyze COVID-19 press conferences and press briefings issued during Feb-May 2020, for over 123 LMICs and for international organizations (e.g. the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Health Organization (WHO)). Our virtual audit shows that only 65% of countries have a sign language interpreter (SLI) present in COVID-19 press briefings and conferences. This number is smaller in low-income countries (41%) and Sub-Saharan African countries (54%). Surprisingly, none of the international organizations including the WHO has a SLI present during COVID-19 press briefings. We recommend all countries and international organizations to reconsider ways to make press conferences accessible to a wide audience in general, and to the hearing impaired communities in particular by including a SLI during their COVID-19 briefings, a primary step towards upholding the sustainable development pledge of "no one gets left behind."
426480f16ca570349b07798d2fb36f14442ce79e	Imbalanced data analysis remains one of the critical challenges in machine learning. This work aims to adapt the concept of Dynamic Classifier Selection (dcs) to the pattern classification task with the skewed class distribution. Two methods, using the similarity (distance) to the reference instances and class imbalance ratio to select the most confident classifier for a given observation, have been proposed. Both approaches come in two modes, one based on the k -Nearest Oracles (knora) and the other also considering those cases where the classifier makes a mistake. The proposed methods were evaluated based on computer experiments carried out on 41 datasets with a high imbalance ratio. The obtained results and statistical analysis confirm the usefulness of the proposed solutions.
2bd6e33d92632dfcba4056a2d7355ced5b7ab1fd	The outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza in domestic poultry and wild birds has caused global concern over the possible evolution of a novel human strain [1] . If such a strain emerges, and is not controlled at source [2,3], a pandemic is likely to result. Health policy in most countries will then be focused on reducing morbidity and mortality. We estimate the expected reduction in primary attack rates for different household-based interventions using a mathematical model of influenza transmission within and between households. We show that, for lower transmissibility strains [2, 4] , the combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the household, and targeted prophylactic use of anti-virals will be highly effective and likely feasible across a range of plausible transmission scenarios. For example, for a basic reproductive number (the average number of people infected by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population) of 1.8, assuming only 50% compliance, this combination could reduce the infection (symptomatic) attack rate from 74% (49%) to 40% (27%), requiring peak quarantine and isolation levels of 6.2% and 0.8% of the population, respectively, and an overall anti-viral stockpile of 3.9 doses per member of the population. Although contact tracing may be additionally effective, the resources required make it impractical in most scenarios. National influenza pandemic preparedness plans currently focus on reducing the impact associated with a constant attack rate, rather than on reducing transmission. Our findings suggest that the additional benefits and resource requirements of household-based interventions in reducing average levels of transmission should also be considered, even when expected levels of compliance are only moderate.
01e59fdda1b5efc2ad16235eb7084b39dbfac513	Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), the causative agent of rabbit hemorrhagic disease, is an important member of the caliciviridae family. Currently, no suitable tissue culture system is available for proliferating RHDV, limiting the study of the pathogenesis of RHDV. In addition, the mechanisms underlying RHDV translation and replication are largely unknown compared with other caliciviridae viruses. The RHDV replicon recently constructed in our laboratory provides an appropriate model to study the pathogenesis of RHDV without in vitro RHDV propagation and culture. Using this RHDV replicon, we demonstrated that the viral genome-linked protein (VPg) is essential for RHDV translation in RK-13 cells for the first time. In addition, we showed that VPg interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in vivo and in vitro and that eIF4E silencing inhibits RHDV translation, suggesting the interaction between VPg and eIF4E is involved in RHDV translation. Our results support the hypothesis that VPg serves as a novel cap substitute during the initiation of RHDV translation.

Microbiol., m, A coronavirus (Kakegawa isolate) isolated from a cow with epizootic diarrhea was grown in BEK-1 cells and examined for biophysical and biochemical properties. The Kakegawa isolate was able to replicate in the presence or absence of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, indicating that its viral nucleic acid was RNA. It was highly sensitive to ether and chloroform, and moderately sensitive to trypsin and heat. It was, however, readily stabilized by treatment with cation at 50°C for 1 h. Its infectivity was slightly reduced at pH 3.0. The virus passed through a membrane filter of 200 nm pore size, but not through one of 100 nm pore size. The buoyant density of the virus was determined in a sucrose density gradient. The peak of infectivity and hemagglutinin activity was found at a density of 1.182. Neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests showed a close serological relationship between the Kakegawa isolate and the American strain of calf diarrhea coronavirus. 0378--1135/80/0000-~000/$02.50
df4368d6df1c13661c83da7618e649cabc2a4428	The current pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is having negative health, social and economic consequences worldwide. In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. It has subsequently spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, in terms of air temperature and humidity, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus's propagation, by short-range droplet transmission as well as likely by long-range aerosol (airborne) transmission.
6a558dabdd9c594f052ef2cc70f1b5202bad5203	Objectives: To determined the pathogen-specific incidence of respiratory virus infection in Hutterite communities occurring over the 2008-2009 influenza season and assess temporal characteristics of respiratory illness related to infection. Methods: 3273 participants community members enrolled in a cluster randomized trial of influenza vaccine were studied. Results: One hundred forty-nine participants had laboratoryconfirmed influenza, and 595 had at least one episode of laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection other than influenza. Entero ⁄ rhinovirus had the highest incidence among children <5 years. Conclusions: A decline in the incidence of infections with age was observed for influenza as well as for most other respiratory viruses.
a098e4f32339387981bcead95063c2f81c1f98a5	The pandemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent data showed that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, data indicate that hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are important risk factors for progression and unfavorable outcome in COVID-19 patients. There is only limited amount of data regarding follow-up of these patients, and they provided conflicting results. The main limitation is a small number of participants and particularly those who experienced primary composite outcome (admission in intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death). Additionally, the limited number of patients was essential obstacle for performing analysis that would include many confounding factors such as advanced age, smoking status, and obesity and potentially change conclusion. So far, there is no study that demonstrated independent predictive value of diabetes on mortality in COVID-19 patients, but there are many speculations about the association between diabetes and susceptibility to novel coronavirus, as well as its impact on progression and prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this review article was to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 and its role in outcome in these patients.
87fb87a95a08bdd98ee2681665d0f09687924af8	Introduction It has been recognized that significant transporter interactions result in volume of distribution changes in addition to potential changes in clearance. For drugs that are not clinically significant transporter substrates, it is expected that drug-drug interactions would not result in any changes in volume of distribution. Methods An evaluation of this hypothesis proceeded via an extensive analysis of published intravenous metabolic drug-drug interactions, based on clinically recommended index substrates and inhibitors of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Results Seventy-two metabolic drug interaction studies were identified where volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss ) values were available for the CYP index substrates caffeine (CYP1A2), metoprolol (CYP2D6), midazolam (CYP3A4), theophylline (CYP1A2), and tolbutamide (CYP2C9). Changes in exposure (area under the curve) up to 5.1-fold were observed; however, ratios of V ss changes have a range of 0.70-1.26, with one outlier displaying a V ss ratio of 0.57. Discussion These results support the widely held founding tenant of pharmacokinetics that clearance and V ss are independent parameters. Knowledge that V ss is unchanged in metabolic drug-drug interactions can be helpful in discriminating changes in clearance from changes in bioavailability (F) when only oral dosing data are available, as we have recently demonstrated. As V ss remains unchanged for intravenous metabolic drug-drug interactions, following oral dosing changes in V ss /F will reflect changes in F alone. This estimation of F change can subsequently be utilized to assess changes in clearance alone from calculations of apparent clearance. Utilization of this simple methodology for orally dosed drugs will have a significant impact on how drug-drug interactions are interpreted from drug development and regulatory perspectives.
8adc1ad8317137b9c288302ee8d579cf5a017404	2007) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology 33, 599-614 Review: Parkinson's disease: a dual-hit hypothesis Accumulating evidence suggests that sporadic Parkinson's disease has a long prodromal period during which several non-motor features develop, in particular, impairment of olfaction, vagal dysfunction and sleep disorder. Early sites of Lewy pathology are the olfactory bulb and enteric plexus of the stomach. We propose that a neurotropic pathogen, probably viral, enters the brain via two routes: (i) nasal, with anterograde progression into the temporal lobe; and (ii) gastric, secondary to swallowing of nasal secretions in saliva. These secretions might contain a neurotropic pathogen that, after penetration of the epithelial lining, could enter axons of the Meissner's plexus and, via transsynaptic transmission, reach the preganglionic parasympathetic motor neurones of the vagus nerve. This would allow retrograde transport into the medulla and, from here, into the pons and midbrain until the substantia nigra is reached and typical aspects of disease commence. Evidence for this theory from the perspective of olfactory and autonomic dysfunction is reviewed, and the possible routes of pathogenic invasion are considered. It is concluded that the most parsimonious explanation for the initial events of sporadic Parkinson's disease is pathogenic access to the brain through the stomach and nosehence the term 'dual-hit'.
551b7cd62a524570056e48a1cb5235b937d1c313	The SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus identified as the cause of COVID-19, and as the pandemic evolves, many have made parallels to previous epidemics such as SARS-CoV (the cause of an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) in 2003. Many have speculated that, like SARS, the activity of SARS-CoV-2 will subside when the climate becomes warmer. We sought to determine the relationship between ambient temperature and COVID-19 incidence in Canada. We analyzed over 77,700 COVID-19 cases from four Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec) from January to May 2020. After adjusting for precipitation, wind gust speed, and province in multiple linear regression models, we found a positive, but not statistically significant, association between cumulative incidence and ambient temperature (14.2 per 100,000 people; 95%CI: -0.60-29.0). We also did not find a statistically significant association between total cases or effective reproductive number of COVID-19 and ambient temperature. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that higher temperatures will reduce transmission of COVID-19 and warns the public not to lose vigilance, and to continue practicing safety measures such as hand washing, social distancing, and use of facial masks despite the warming climates. Journal Pre-proof R, total cumulative incident cases, and cumulative incidence rate. Models were made using the latest data available, up to 18 May 2020. Covariates for models were selected a priori. All models were adjusted for wind gust speed, precipitation, and province. Regression models were adjusted for the province where the health region was located to control for different social distancing and public health policies that may have Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f been in place. Statistical significance was defined where p-values were < 0.05. All analyses were performed in R (version 4.0.0) with the rms (v6.0.0) and tidyverse (v1.3.0) packages. 19-21 We observed 49 health regions across four Canadian provinces that collectively made up 99. 6% (77,773) of Canada's COVID-19 cases from January 25 to May 18, 2020. The mean ± standard deviation and range (min-max) for temperature was (1.48 ± 3.46, -6.83-7.94), wind gust speed was (43.5 ± 2.45, 29.9-49.5), and precipitation was (2.03 ± 0.78, 0.44-3.72). Mean temperature and total precipitation tended to decrease at higher latitudes. The mean ± standard deviation and range for R and cumulative incidence were (1.27 ± 1.25, 0.27-8.85) and (133.7 ± 100.4, 15.8-415.7), respectively. Total cumulative cases and cumulative incidence rates tended to be highest in and around urban centres. After adjusting for wind gust speed, precipitation, and province, our results did not find a statistically significant association between temperature and R (p=0.74) (see Table 2 ). The multiple regression model, adjusted for wind gust speed, precipitation, and province, showed that per unit increase in temperature, there was an associated increase in COVID-19 incidence cases of 14.3 per 100,000 people (95%CI: -0.20-29.0; p=0.07), as shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 . However, this association was statistically nonsignificant. The association between temperature and cumulative incidence rate was further analyzed by province while adjusting for wind gust speed and precipitation. None of the province-specific regression coefficients for temperature reached statistical significance.
4ae013938dce3aa0f6b63b49e37489f06a5d9a57	We thank Cohen et al for their letter on our recent report on the association of inpatient use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with mortality among the hospitalized coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients with hypertension from Hubei, China. 1 As Cohen et al pointed out, and clearly discussed in our original report, the inherent limitations of such retrospective study must be carefully considered in interpreting the results. Indeed, we had a great deal of concerns about potential bias and implemented 3 different models to cross-validate the key conclusions. First, a mixedeffect Cox model was used by adjusting for confounding variables. Second, we applied a stricter propensity scorematched analysis, followed by adjusting imbalanced variables. Finally, to further minimize the potential bias resulting from patients who did not receive antihypertensive drugs, we conducted a subgroup propensity score-matched analysis by including only the patients who received antihypertensive medication during hospitalization. We did not find an association for harm with those on ACEI/ARB in all 3 models. Cohen et al stated that "sicker patients will almost invariably be less likely to receive ACEIs/ARBs. " As we reported, after matching, the baseline characteristics of the ACEI/ARB group and nonuser group were largely comparable, while the remaining imbalanced variables were further adjusted. We agree with Cohen et al that there might be some unmeasured confounders. As such, we performed an E-value and 2 other sensitivity analyses to further assess the robustness of the conclusion. The results remained consistent and statistically significant in these sensitivity analyses for both mixed-effect Cox and propensity score-matched models. Regarding the proportion of ACEI/ARB users, however, the calculation by Cohen et al was inappropriate. In China, the therapeutic ratio of hypertension was only 40.7%, and ACEI/ARB was used only in 25% to 30% among those patients. 2 In our study, this proportion was 25.2%, which was consistent with that for the general hypertensive patients in China. Thus, the concern from Cohen et al regarding the lower-than-expected number of patients taking ACEI/ARB was not correct. About the immortal time bias mentioned by Cohen et al, we agree that a longer-term and stable exposure to ACEI/ARB would further solidify their association with COVID-19 mortality. Unfortunately, as we clearly acknowledged in our original article, prehospital medications were not available in the in-hospital electronic record systems due to the urgent circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic. We agree that this potential immortal time-related bias may still exist as an inherent limitation of an observational study even after rigorous matching and adjustment. More recently, Rentsch et al 3 reported a retrospective study including 2 026 227 veterans from the United States but did not find a significant association between ACEI/ARB use and the need for intensive care in patients with However, they did not analyze whether the use of ACEI/ARB was associated with mortality. The complex composition and obvious confounders (eg, ethnicity, comorbidities, severity, and in-hospital medications) of this large-scale cohort may have significant impact on this conclusion, which, however, was not matched or rigorously adjusted. Another recent JAMA report including 5700 patients with COVID-19 in the New York City also included the data of ACEI/ARB usage. 4 The mortality rates for patients with hypertension taking ACEI (32.7%), or taking ARB (30.6%), or not taking ACEI or ARB (26.7%) were calculated. Unfortunately,
0e8c94d742f86efea638ceadf11213a809402f95	An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R 0 of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57%, and it is 2.37% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, Carcione et al. Modeling the COVID-19 Epidemic the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.

Merozoite expressed Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 binds to human erythrocytes and facilitates parasite growth in a heterlologous Plasmodium falciparum culture system. Recently, we identified band 3 in human erythrocytes as one of its receptors, although the receptor-ligand binding mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, using synthetic mutated peptides of PvTRAg38, we show that multiple amino acid residues of its 12 amino acid domain (KWVQWKNDKIRS) at position 197-208 interact with three different ectodomains of band 3 receptor on human erythrocytes. Our findings may help in the design of new therapeutic approaches for malaria.
568fec0df53acc098777e861ab6b824bf22ca3e4	The human gut mucosa is a major site of HIV infection and infection-associated pathogenesis. Increasing evidence shows that natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in control of HIV infection but the mechanism(s) by which they mediate antiviral activity in the gut is unclear. Here we show two distinct subsets of NK cells exist in the gut, one localized to intraepithelial spaces (IEL) and the other to the lamina propria (LP). The frequency of both subsets of NK cells was reduced in chronic infection, whereas IEL NK cells remained stable in spontaneous controllers with protective KIR/HLA genotypes. Both IEL and LP NK cells were significantly expanded in immunologic non-responsive (INR) patients, who incompletely recovered CD4+ T cells on HAART. These data suggest that both IEL and LP NK cells may expand in the gut in an effort to compensate for compromised CD4+ T cell recovery, but that only IEL NK cells may be involved in providing durable control of HIV in the gut, Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:
707eca1c11971566515ba9410fb63451cb19828e	Objectives To gain insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing health research projects, using projects from a selected funding programme in Germany as an example. Setting Lockdowns and social distancing policies impact upon clinical and public health research in various forms, especially if unrelated to COVID-19. Research institutions have reduced onsite activities, data is often collected remotely, and during the height of the crisis, clinical researchers were partially forced to abandon their projects in favour of front-line care and crisis response. Participants 120 investigators of health research projects across Germany, performed between 15 and 25 May 2020. The response rate (78%) showed that the survey generated significant interest among investigators. 85 responses were included for analysis, and the majority of investigators (93%) reported that their projects were affected by the pandemic, with many (80%) stating that data collection was not possible as planned, and they could not carry out interventions as planned (67%). Other impacts were caused by staff being unavailable, for example through child or elder care commitments or because of COVID-19 quarantine or illness. Investigators also reported that publications were delayed or not feasible at all (56%), and some experienced problems with PhD or Masters theses (18%). The majority of investigators had mitigation strategies in place such as All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. perpetuity. : medRxiv preprint adjustment of data collection methods using digital tools (46%) or of project implementation in general (46%), others made changes in research design or research questions (27%). The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted upon health research projects. The main challenge is now to mitigate negative effects and to improve long-term resilience in health research. The pandemic has also acted as a driver of innovation and change, for example by accelerating the use of digital methods. • To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on non COVID-19 health research projects, mitigation strategies employed by investigators and needs for support. • The sample is representative of the projects from the "Healthy -for a lifetime" funding programme in Germany, which includes different types of health research projects and involves different population groups. • We were not able to clearly distinguish the effects on different types of projects (clinical studies, observational studies, secondary data analyses etc.), because a small number of investigators led more than one project and were not asked to report on each project individually. • The survey presents a snapshot of the situation in May 2020. To assess effects more widely as well as long-term impacts on projects, the survey would need to be repeated. (WHO) in March 2020 (1). The virus is spread from person to person through direct contact and droplets (2) Subsequently, governmental responses worldwide have focused on mitigation strategies such as social distancing, travel and movement restrictions, school closures, restricting group and mass gatherings, up to the banning of public transport and lockdown of offices, services and industries (3, 4, 1).
3e0d87afadeece79c5d75aa3a2821af94f1608f6	This article discusses the potential ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on waste and 10 wastewater services, focusing on critical points where alternative operating procedures or 11 additional mitigation measures may be advisable. Key concerns are (i) the long half-life of 12 the virus on materials such as waste containers, bags, and in wastewater, and (ii) possible 13 transmission via contaminated waste surfaces and aerosols from wastewater systems. There 14 are opportunities to further the science of wastewater-based epidemiology by monitoring 15 viral RNA in wastewater to assess disease prevalence and spread in defined populations, 16 which may prove beneficial for informing COVID-19 related public health policy.
79284efbde971538024ccbe888fa90bcd515d45c	The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22-25 • C and relative humidity of 40-50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log 10 ) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38 • C, and relative humidity of >95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment did not have major community outbreaks of SARS.
ba03872acbf70a4e255f44a03c850da70cb402fe	Study objective: The potential of infectious disease spread in diseases such as tuberculosis, infectious disease epidemic such as avian flu and the threat of terrorism with agents capable of airborne transmission have focused attention on the need for increased surge capacity for patient isolation. Total negative pressure isolation using portable bioisolation tents may provide a solution. The study assesses the ability of health care workers to perform emergency procedures in this environment. Methods: Physician performance in completing predetermined critical actions in 5 emergency care scenarios inside and outside of a bioisolation tent ("setting") was studied in an advanced medical simulation laboratory. By design, no pretraining of subjects about total negative pressure isolation use occurred. Impact of setting on time to completion of predetermined critical actions was the primary outcome measured. Secondary variables studied included impact of study groups, scenarios, and run order (inside or outside of the tent first). Subjective assessments were obtained through questionnaires. Results: Four teams of 3 physicians completed 5 emergency patient care scenarios during 2 4-hour sessions. Mean time to completion of critical actions was for tent/no tent 298 seconds/284 seconds (Pϭ.69, one way ANOVA), respectively. Mean time to completion for first versus second performance of a scenario in the crossover design was 338 versus 243 (Pϭ.01). The mean score for self-assessed performance did not differ according to setting. The ability of physicians naive to the total negative pressure isolation environment to perform emergency medical critical actions was not significantly degraded by a simulated bioisolation tent patient care environment.
a46d2cd0e65ba71e9d1ccf20762c9043ed3e67c2	Background: Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is characterized by interstitial infiltration of T lymphocytes, and subpopulations of these cells may be associated with the progression of fibrosis. However, few studies evaluate the correlation of prognosis with this characteristic. Therefore, we performed morphological and quantitative analyses of T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP and evaluated the relationship between T lymphocytes and prognosis. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 55 biopsies of patients with NSIP to determine the numbers of these T cell subpopulations in lymphoid follicles as well as in perivascular, interstitial, and peribronchial anatomical compartments. The relationship between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations and prognosis was analyzed. Results: The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 ± 10.5 years, and 36 (65 %) of patients were women. All patients were followed for a mean duration of 46 ± 25 months. Thirteen (23.6 %) patients died during follow-up. Perivascular CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration (HR, 0.939; 95 % CI, 0.883-0.999; p = 0.048) was an independent risk factor for survival. Perivascular infiltrates of CD4+ T lymphocytes correlated with survival time (r = 0.270, p = 0.046). Patients with improved forced vital capacity survived longer and had higher numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes that infiltrated perivascular tissue. The densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrating other tissues were not significantly associated with survival time. Conclusions: Perivascular infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP correlated with prognosis. The underlying mechanisms are unknown and require further studies.
e128ee56cee672755743295d0a33cb1b876be450	Even before the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID for short) crisis, telemedicine (TM) enabled by digital health technologies was considered a key solution to the health care access problem in rural communities. However, use of TM to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) has been limited even during the recent opioid crisis in America, despite the high rates of opioid overdose and death rates in many rural areas. This limited use of TM-based medication treatment for OUD (MOUD) has been mostly attributed to restrictions imposed by federal and state regulations for TM (eg, licensing, reimbursement) and patient challenges (eg, accessing and using the technology). The current "collision of the COVID and addiction epidemics" 1 forces a drastically increased demand for remote care models for MOUD. We reflect on what virtual high-quality care entails and how access to these services can be expanded. The opioid crisis has hit hard in many rural communities and has brought health care access issues to the forefront in these areas. 2 Opioid treatment programs that dispense methadone require frequent or daily visits which are difficult to adhere to given the long-distance travel often re-quired in these areas. Primary care is at the core of rural health care systems. To expand MOUD access, national efforts have focused on primary care to promote officebased opioid treatment (OBOT), which allows clinicians to provide medication such as buprenorphine or naltrexone to treat OUD in their own clinical settings. Nevertheless, OBOT uptake has been slow in rural communities, with 29.8% of rural Americans compared with 2.2% of urban Americans living in a county without a buprenorphine provider. 3 Studies using retrospective chart reviews have shown that MOUD

f555eb7cee704756a696f3d628466c7431bb6690	Objectives: To measure the prevalence rate of, and determine the association between food and drink related behaviors and diarrheal illness among Japanese tourists, and assess their health care needs. Methods: Eligible Japanese tourists (1,480) aged ≥15 years traveling in Chiangmai Province in the north, Ayutthaya Province in the center, Kanchanaburi Province in the west, Pattaya City in the east, and Krabi Province in the south of Thailand were enrolled in the study. Of these tourists, 1,318 consented to participate in this study and completed questionnaires in Japanese, giving a response rate of 89.1%. Results: Among these Japanese tourists 21.3% had diarrheal illness, and of these tourists, 5.0% had classical travelers' diarrhea (TD), 11.8% had mild TD, 3.3% had good food and drink related behaviors, and 75.4% had moderate level of perception of diarrhea related to drinking and eating. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated three significant diarrheal illness predictors: large number of previous visits to Thailand, longer stay in Thailand, and the experience of visiting other countries. Furthermore, 56.9% suggested providing an adequate number of toilets at tourist destinations; 53.9% suggested providing a 24-hour emergency call facility for a public ambulance; and 51.9% suggested providing garbage bins and garbage disposal facilities at tourist destinations. Conclusions: TD still affects experienced Japanese tourists who visit Thailand. Although the proportions of the good levels of food and drink related behaviors were low, there were indications that Japanese tourists perceived the risk of contracting TD.
fc221d8af0a962a17778721217b1f9f914f353b4	The first imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in China recently occurred, allowing for the characterization of antibody titers in a series of the patient's sera using the following methods based on recombinant viral structural antigens: inactivated MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), recombinant MERS-CoV spike (S, or fragments of S) ELISA, nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA and MERS S pseudovirus particle-based neutralization test (ppNT). A longitudinal profile of the infection showed that seroconversion detected by ELISAs based on the recombinant extracellular domain, S, S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigens occurred as early as neutralizing antibodies were detected by the ppNT and earlier than antibodies were detected by the inactivated MERS-CoV and N-terminal domain (NTD) ELISAs. Antibodies detected by the NP ELISA occurred last. Strong correlations were found between the S1, RBD and NP ELISAs and the inactivated MERS-CoV ELISA. The S and RBD ELISAs were highly correlated with the commercial S1 ELISA. The S ELISA strongly correlated with the ppNT, although the MERS-CoV, S1, NTD and RBD ELISAs were also significantly correlated with the ppNT (Po0.001).
331a8d5001090548608425dbbd81e862151cc4bc	The past two decades have witnessed a major shift in humanitarian operations to respond to more internal conflicts instead of the traditional cross-border wars. Over the recent years, two major shifts have taken place within the WHO to orient toward response to emergencies, namely the introduction of the Humanitarian Reform and the Cluster Approach in 2005 and the introduction of the Emergency Response Framework (ERF). The financing of the agency in humanitarian operations is adding emerging elements to the WHO operations, especially because of the constantly higher contribution from nonstate-and state-funding agencies. Pending issues include aspects like health strategy, conflict analysis, legal issues of aid delivery, impartiality in delivering services, and other aspects and needs.
075de2d475666fb451d348f197cbce139bb6540d	SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) has caused currently ongoing global plague and imposed great challenges to health managing systems all over the world, with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. In addition to racing to develop vaccines, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to this virus have been extensively sought and are expected to provide another prevention and therapy tool against this frantic pandemic. To offer fast isolation and shortened early development, a large human naïve phage display antibody library, was built and used to screen specific nAbs to the receptor-binding domain, RBD, the key for Covid-19 virus entry through a human receptor, ACE2. The obtained RBD-specific antibodies were characterized by epitope mapping, FACS and neutralization assay. Some of the antibodies demonstrated spike-neutralizing property and ACE2-competitiveness. Our work proved that RBD-specific neutralizing binders from human naïve antibody phage display library are promising candidates to for further Covid-19 therapeutics development.

Abstract Background: We evaluated the clinical performance of an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-CoV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. Findings: Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8%, 48.0%, and 95.8% of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3%, 8.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4% (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3% (55/74) and 82.4% (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusion: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.
001b7a3388e3c1e712a01e30cdd8dbd3e8535e1e	Viruses are small infectious agents that replicate only inside the living cells of other organisms and comprise approximately 94% of the nucleic acid-containing particles in the oceans. They are believed to play a central role in evolution, are responsible for various human diseases, and have important contributions to biotechnology and nanotechnology. Viruses undergo evolutionary selection for efficient transmission from host to host by exploiting the host's gene expression machinery (e.g., ribosomes) for the expression of the genes encoded in their genomes. As a result, viral genes tend to be expressed via non-canonical mechanisms that are very rare in living organisms. Many of the gene expression stages and other aspects of the viral life cycle are encoded in the viral transcripts via 'silent codes', and are induced by mutations that are synonymous to the viral amino acid content. In a series of studies that included the analyses of dozens of organisms from the three domains of life, it was shown that there are overlapping 'silent codes' in the genetic code that are related to all stages of gene expression regulation. The aim of this chapter is to summarize the current knowledge related to the silent codes in viral genomes and the open questions in the field.
179a3e8faad2c657015ddeb91ea52bb9bd83724d	This paper is concerned with nonlinear modeling and analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic currently ravaging the planet. There are two objectives: to arrive at an appropriate model that captures the collected data faithfully and to use that as a basis to explore the nonlinear behavior. We use a nonlinear susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed transmission model with added behavioral and government policy dynamics. We develop a genetic algorithm technique to identify key model parameters employing COVID-19 data from South Korea. Stability, bifurcations and dynamic behavior are analyzed. Parametric analysis reveals conditions for sustained epidemic equilibria to occur. This work points to the value of nonlinear dynamic analysis in pandemic modeling and demonstrates the dramatic influence of social and government behavior on disease dynamics.
11a27e81a2b607cad6243f6231e7454642b97699	The infection coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by a virus classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). At cellular level, virus infection initiates with binding of viral particles to the host surface cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming. TMPRSS2 activity is essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. Understanding how TMPRSS2 protein expression in the lung varies in the population could reveal important insights into differential susceptibility to influenza and coronavirus infections. Here, we systematically analyzed coding-region variants in TMPRSS2 and the eQTL variants, which may affect the gene expression, to compare the genomic characteristics of TMPRSS2 among different populations. Our findings suggest that the lung-specific eQTL variants may confer different susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from different populations under the similar conditions. In particular, we found that the eQTL variant rs35074065 is associated with high expression of TMPRSS2 but with a low expression of the interferon (IFN)-α/β-inducible gene, MX1, splicing isoform. Thus, these subjects could account for a more susceptibility either to viral infection or to a decrease in cellular antiviral response. IA, RR and MC designed and conducted the study, and prepared the manuscript; MC, VAL and RR analysed the data; AI provided critical review of the manuscript. All the authors read and approved the final manuscript.
dbbeaadadbca8bbf5ba742877f1e725920d48b4a	Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD. It is believed that changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.

93cfc371a1c1d2183b5ae26bb5fe7c3c3a9fee3f	We examine the relationship between cryptocurrencies (namely Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP)) and COVID-19 cases/deaths. This will help explore whether cryptocurrencies can serve as a hedge against COVID-19. The wavelet coherence analysis indicates that there is initially a negative relationship between Bitcoin and the number of reported cases and deaths; however, the relationship becomes positive during the later period. The findings for Ethereum and Ripple are also similar but with weaker interactions. This supports the hedging role of cryptocurrencies against the uncertainty raised by COVID-19.
dbad2ff01d28beb2b4abb88417b2bf24c082e19d	We want to thank Dr. Gunasakeran and colleagues for providing further clarity on our editorial published earlier in this journal (1). We concur that the recent regulatory framework for e-cigarettes approved by the Trump administration does not go far enough. As of February 6th of this year, the sales of any flavored cartridge-based electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) product (other than tobacco or menthol flavor ENDS) has been banned (2). This feeble ban does not affect the sales of e-liquid solutions and/or disposable e-cigarettes, which continue to be marketed and sold in many convenience stores around the country, enticing many of our children to become nicotine addicts longing their next dopamine release while increasing the revenues of the tobacco and e-cigarette industry. This is evidenced by the large surge in the popularity of Mango flavored PUFF Bar disposable devices, and JUULcompatible PUFF Bar Mango flavored pods, in adolescent users. The "ban" also fails to address the doctoring of e-liquids by the addition of tetrahydrocannabinol, which is legal for recreational use in many states and is the fastest growing way in which adolescents are exposed to this psychoactive substance (3). We are also particularly disappointed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not ban menthol because the FDA itself has reported that menthol increases nicotine addiction and is favored by younger populations, women, and black Americans (4). Since our original submission, another important piece of federal legislation was implemented. As of December 20, 2019, the legal age to buy tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, was raised from 18 to 21 years old (5). However, many cities across the nation and almost 20 states had already enacted this age limit, commonly known as Tobacco 21. The FDA now needs to present a plan for implementation and enforcement of this law on the national level. As we in the United States and the entire world fight the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we are concerned that a lackadaisical federal response to e-cigarettes will have significant deleterious consequences for the health of our nation. However, we continue to be hopeful knowing that, as of today, no ENDS products have been officially authorized by the FDA, meaning that all ENDS products currently on the market are considered illegally marketed and are subject to enforcement at the FDA's discretion. Furthermore, May 12th of this year marks the deadline for e-cigarette manufacturers to apply to the FDA and submit their products for public health review. We urge the FDA to carefully review these applications and regulate for the public good.
7bb199c23ba81f1cfb56b84f7063ad86cb35f0c8	Porcine epidemic diarrhea viral (PEDV); Lactic acid bacteria; N protein Summary In this report, for surface display of viral antigen on lactobacilli, we have developed a surface antigen display system using the poly-␥-glutamate synthetase A protein (pgsA) of Bacillus subtilis as an anchoring matrix. Recombinant fusion proteins comprised of pgsA and neucleocapsid protein of PEDV were stably expressed in Lactobacillus casei. Surface location of fusion protein was verified by ELISA, immunofluoresence microscopy. Oral and intranasal inoculations of recombinant L. casei into pregnant sow and mice resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobuline G (IgG) and mucosal IgA, as demonstrated by rnELISA(recombinant N protein ELISA) using recombinant N protein. Absorbance of IgG in pregnant sow sera highly increased duration of the experiment. More importantly, the level of IgA in colostrum were increased significantly higher than that of IgG. The IgG levels of the piglets were increased after suckling colostrum secreted from sows previously inoculated recombinant L. casei. These results indicate that mucosal immunization with recombinant L. casei expressing PEDV N protein (neucleoprotein of PEDV) on its surface elicited high levels of mucosal IgA and circulation IgG immune responses against the antigen N of PEDV.
f332bad3c29297fe115a932a096a810918691c41	In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2. To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, proteomic datasets, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples. We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung, confirmed with proteomics. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 and GRP78 in the respiratory mucosa. Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by the SARS coronavirus (CoV) resulted in 8096 probable cases with 774 confirmed deaths [1, 2] In patients with SARS, deaths were attributed to acute respiratory distress associated with diffuse bilateral pneumonia and alveolar damage [3]. In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading at a much more rapid rate than SARS-CoV [4-6]. Similar clinical reports of diffuse bilateral pneumonia and alveolar damage have been reported[7-9]. Severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with infections of the lower respiratory tract with detection of the virus throughout this tissue as well as the upper respiratory tract[7-9]. The biological mechanisms that may govern differences in the number of SARS and COVID-19 cases remain undefined. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 possesses distinct molecular mechanisms that impact the virulence through viral proteins, greater susceptibility of host cells to infection, permissivity of host cells to virus replication, or some combination of these and other potentially unknown factors[10-13]. Understanding SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus similarities and differences at the molecular level in the host may provide insights into transmission, pathogenesis, and interventions. The seminal report identifying the receptor for SARS-CoV used a HEK293 cell overexpression system to identify angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor by coimmunoprecipitation with SARS-CoV spike domain 1[14]. Subsequently, spike protein of SARS-CoV was identified as the viral interacting partner of ACE2. Host protease activity by TMPRSS2 facilitates ACE2 ectodomain cleavage and fusion of SARS-CoV membrane with host cell membrane[15-17]. ADAM17 has also been demonstrated to cleave ACE2 ectodomain, but this was not required for SARS CoV infection[18-20]. Mechanisms of SARS CoV entry distinct from ACE2 have also been reported and include activation by endosomal cathepsin L and cell surface expression of CD147 or GRP78[21-23] Each of these receptors were mechanistically interrogated and suggest that SARS CoV could initiate host cell entry and infection using METHODS: Human ethics: Procurement of primary human airway epithelial cells used for immunoblots and lung tissue for immunohistochemistry was approved by Hamilton integrated Research Ethics Board (HiREB 5099T, 5305T, 11-3559 and 13-523-C). UBC Research Ethics Office approved heart tissue archives and primary human airway epithelial cell collection. Upper and lower airway gene expression analysis: Public microarray experiments using Affymetrix chips (HuGene-1.0-st-v1 and HG-U133 Plus 2) on airway epithelial cell samples collected from nasal (GSE19190) or bronchial (GSE11906) brushings of healthy, non-smokers were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [33, 34]. This resulted in a total of 80 individual samples from the two different experiments which includes 11 upper airway samples (Nasal: 11) and 69 lower airway samples (Trachea: 17, Large Airway: 17, Small Airway: 35). For all dataset samples, raw intensity values and annotation data were downloaded using the GEOquery R package (version 2.52.0)[35] from the Bioconductor project [36]. Probe definition files were downloaded from Bioconductor and probes were annotated using Bioconductor's annotate package. All gene expression data were unified into a single dataset that was then RMA-normalized, and only genes present in both of the Affymetrix platforms (N = 16,013) were kept for subsequent analyses. Correction of experiment-specific batch effects was performed using the ComBat method[37] implemented using the sva R package (version 3.32.1)[38]. RMA-normalized expression levels for conventional (ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, and CTSL) and non-conventional (CD147, and GRP78) SARS-CoV-2 receptor genes were compared across the four defined airway levels, with CDH1 expression level included as a positive control with known expression in lung tissue. Gene expression levels were tested for significant differences via pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction using the stats R package (version 3.6.1). Gene expression box plots were generated with the ggplot2 R package (version 3.2.1). Analysis of Curated Bronchial Epithelial Cell Brushing Dataset: A total of 1,859 public microarray experiments using Affymetrix chips (HG-U133 Plus 2 and HuGene-1.0-st-v1) on airway epithelial cell samples were selected from the NCBI GEO database. These samples were further filtered by removing individuals with asthma or COPD, resulting in a total of 504 individual healthy samples (GSE4302, 28 samples; GSE67472, 43 samples; GSE37147, 159 samples; GSE108134, 274 samples). Within this dataset, sex and age information was included for 310 samples with 86 females/106 males. Smoking status information was also provided for 451 samples with 260 current smokers, 82 former smokers, and 109 never smokers. For all dataset samples, raw intensity values and annotation data were downloaded as described above. Probe definition files were retrieved as described above. All gene expression data were unified into a single dataset that was then RMA-normalized, and only genes present in both of the Affymetrix platforms (N = 16,105) were kept for subsequent analyses. Correction of experiment-specific batch effects was performed as described above. Analysis of promoter activity from the FANTOM5 dataset: The FANTOM5 promoterome dataset [39] for the hg38 assembly[40] was used to examine promoter activity of SARS-CoV-2related human genes, namely ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, CTSL (cathepsin L1), CD147 and GRP78. Using the ZENBU genome browser [41], the nearest cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) peak upstream and on the same strand as each of the aforementioned genes was extracted and analyzed. The dataset consists of CAGE promoter activity data for 1,886 primary cells, cell lines, and tissues from humans, and quantified as normalized transcripts per million (TPM). A subset of FANTOM5 CAGE data (120 samples) is presented considering only samples related to lung, gut, heart, and prostate tissues (consisting of 74, 19, 15, and 12 samples, respectively). Normalized TPM values for each CAGE peak, an approximation for promoter activity, were log 10 transformed and separated according to tissue and cell type, and the radius of each point is proportional to these transformed normalized TPM values. Analysis of protein abundance from proteomic datasets: Publicly available human proteomic data from Kim et al [31] and Foster et al [32] datasets were used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 receptor-related protein expression in different human tissues and experimental conditions. Expression values were extracted from the Kim et al. dataset for ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, CTSL (cathepsin L1), BSG (CD147), HSPA5 (GRP78), using CDH1 as a control for airway cells. Data were created using the pheatmap package in R (version 1.0.12) and expressed as log10transformed to facilitate visualization. Proteomic data from the Foster et al. dataset consists of bronchial epithelial cells collected from healthy, non-smokers (N=4; male) and exposed to phosphate-buffered saline control vehicle. Intensity values for ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, CD147, and GRP78 were extracted with CDH1 included as a positive control. Intensity values were determined by the original study authors via normalization of all detected peptide intensities associated with a given parent protein [32]. Box plots were generated with the ggplot2 R package (version 3.2.1) with intensity values log10-transformed for visualization purposes. Analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data: Data preprocessed using the Cell Ranger pipeline (10x Genomics) were obtained from GSE135893. Samples from 10 control subjects and 12 IPF patients were downloaded and post-processed with Seurat package in R[42]. Cell populations were defined using the markers provided in the source paper [43]. Cells belonging to the 10 control subjects were used for further analysis. Visualizations of violin plots were created using Seurat.

Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza. Objectives: Determine the clinical and molecular characteristics of influenza A and B infections in children and adolescents with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods: A cohort of outpatient children and adolescents with ILI was followed for 20 months. Influenza was diagnosed with commercial multiplex PCR platforms. : 179 patients had 277 episodes of ILI, being 79 episodes of influenza A and 20 episodes of influenza B. Influenza A and B cases were mild and had similar presentation. Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent vaccines. Conclusions: Influenza A and B are often detected in children and adolescents with ILI episodes, with similar and mild presentation in outpatients. The mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the trivalent vaccine offered in Brazil may have contributed to the high frequency of influenza A and B in this population.
c46ebccdbe4c88c246385fb60485cefb89334fc4	The medulloblastoma (MB) microenvironment is diverse, and cell-cell interactions within this milieu is of prime importance. Astrocytes, a major component of the microenvironment, have been shown to impact primary tumor cell phenotypes and metastasis. Based on proximity of MB cells and astrocytes in the brain microenvironment, we investigated whether astrocytes may influence MB cell phenotypes directly. Astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) increased Daoy MB cell invasion, adhesion, and in vivo cellular protrusion formation. ACM conditioning of MB cells also increased CD133 surface expression, a key cancer stem cell marker of MB. Additional neural stem cell markers, Nestin and Oct-4A, were also increased by ACM conditioning, as well as neurosphere formation. By knocking down CD133 using short interfering RNA (siRNA), we showed that ACM upregulated CD133 expression in MB plays an important role in invasion, adhesion and neurosphere formation. Collectively, our data suggests that astrocytes influence MB cell phenotypes by regulating CD133 expression, a key protein with defined roles in MB tumorgenicity and survival.

4b72bc09e112441f66281556728d4b02f86b16eb	Presently, COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to researchers, scientists, health professionals, and administrations around the globe from its detection to its treatment. The whole world is witnessing a lockdown like situation because of COVID-19 pandemic. Persistent efforts are being made by the researchers to obtain the possible solutions to control this pandemic in their respective areas. One of the most common and effective methods applied by the researchers is the use of CT-Scans and X-rays to analyze the images of lungs for COVID-19. However, it requires several radiology specialists and time to manually inspect each report which is one of the challenging tasks in a pandemic. In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning neural network-based method nCOVnet, an alternative fast screening method that can be used for detecting the COVID-19 by analyzing the X-rays of patients which will look for visual indicators found in the chest radiography imaging of COVID-19 patients.
da6cbb02235c0dd1f9655e970dc9a87145f1ddcb	Angiogenesis, the process of new microvessel development, is encountered in a select number of physiological processes and is central to the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases. There is now convincing evidence that regulated patterns of endothelial cell survival and death, a process known as apoptosis, play a central role in the periodic remodeling of the vasculature, and in the timely evolution and regression of angiogenic responses. In this review we discuss the current evidence suggesting a role for inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis as well as other mediators that modify endothelial cells functions in the survival and death of endothelial cells. We also discuss how dysregulation of apoptosis can lead to aberrant angiogenesis as demonstrated in the pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity and cancer.
df609c8fcfc22cc93f882adbb8c3f4f9a41ee9b1	Background: Chronic patients persistently seek for health information on the internet for medication information seeking, nutrition, disease management, information regarding disease preventive actions and so on. Consumers ability to search, find, appraise and use health information from the internet is known as eHealth literacy skill. eHealth literacy is a congregate set of six basic skills (traditional literacy, health literacy, information literacy, scientific literacy, media literacy and computer literacy). The aim of this study was to assess eHealth literacy level and associated factors among internet user chronic patients in North-west Ethiopia. Methods: Institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted. Stratified sampling technique was used to select 423 study participants among chronic patients. The eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) was used for data collection. The eHEALS is a validated eight-item Likert scaled questionnaire used to asses self-reported capability of eHealth consumers to find, appraise, and use health related information from the internet to solve health problems. Statistical Package for Social science version 20 was used for data entry and further analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between the eHealth literacy skill and associated factors. Significance was obtained at 95% CI and p < 0.05. Result: In total, 423 study subjects were approached and included in the study from February to May, 2019. The response rate to the survey was 95.3%. The majority of respondents 268 (66.3%) were males and mean age was 35.58 ± 14.8 years. The multivariable logistic regression model indicated that participants with higher education (at least having the diploma) are more likely to possess high eHealth literacy skill with Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.48, 95% CI (1.54, 7.87). similarly, being government employee AOR: 1.71, 95% CI (1.11, 2.68), being urban resident AOR: 1.37, 95% CI (0.54, 3.49), perceived good health status AOR: 3.97, 95% CI (1.38, 11.38), having higher income AOR: 4.44, 95% CI (1.32, 14.86), Daily internet use AOR: 2.96, 95% CI (1.08, 6.76), having good knowledge about the availability and importance of online resources AOR: 3.12, 95% CI (1.61, 5.3), having positive attitude toward online resources AOR: 2.94, 95% CI (1.07, 3.52) and higher level of computer literacy AOR: 3.81, 95% CI (2.19, 6.61) were the predictors positively associated with higher eHealth literacy level.

5411fcc705afb94a32bd3f1360455016b96bc4be	Nowadays, the increasing number of patients accompanied with the emergence of new symptoms and diseases makes heath monitoring and assessment a complicated task for medical staff and hospitals. Indeed, the processing of big and heterogeneous data collected by biomedical sensors along with the need of patients' classification and disease diagnosis become major challenges for several health-based sensing applications. Thus, the combination between remote sensing devices and the big data technologies have been proven as an efficient and low cost solution for healthcare applications. In this paper, we propose a robust big data analytics platform for real time patient monitoring and decision making to help both hospital and medical staff. The proposed platform relies on big data technologies and data analysis techniques and consists of four layers: real time patient monitoring, real time decision and data storage, patient classification and disease diagnosis, and data retrieval and visualization. To evaluate the performance of our platform, we implemented our platform based on the Hadoop ecosystem and we applied the proposed algorithms over real health data. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our platform in terms of efficiently performing patient classification and disease diagnosis in healthcare applications.
58537f9ff98ac9e146885f38c33e246de8dc0ece	The features of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) elicited in mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were studied by ELISA and western-blot competition assays. All sera tested contained Ab to cryptic FAH epitopes according with results from western-blot tests, whereas ELISA data indicated that some of these same sera did recognize native epitopes of the autoantigen (autoAg). Such differences were detected in individual sera from various mouse strains, and were ascribed to the fact that proteins insolubilized on solid supports expose a variety of conformational and cryptic antigenic determinants. On the other hand, whereas results from both experimental protocols showed that anti-MHV Ab did not cross-react with the soluble autoAg, the opposite situation did not show analogous results. Thus, binding of autoAb to insolubilized FAH could be inhibited by MHV depending on the mouse serum or the experimental protocol used. Additionally, a set of synthetic homologous peptides from mouse FAH and various viral proteins was employed to analyze the Ab repertoire of MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that two homologous peptides were recognized by most Ab: the N-terminal sequences (1e10) from FAH and the nucleocapside, both sharing 50% of identity, and sequence 2317e2326 of the RNA polymerase, a peptide showing 30% of identity with FAH 11e20. Results indicated that MHV-infection triggers at least three distinct Ab populations: anti-MHV, anti-FAH and cross-reacting Ab. This cross-reaction implies either sequential or conformational epitopes from both the viral proteins and the autoAg and may differ between individuals.

The ongoing problem of police brutality and the resulting deaths of George Floyd (1), Breonna Taylor (2), and many other Black people in the United States (3) has rightly shaken the country. Acts of racism should cause us to question the level to which we have personally participated in the systems of racial inequity that facilitate such acts. We all have an obligation to identify the ways that systemic racism functions in our society and in science. As scientists, we prefer to believe that we are driven by data and are immune to such detrimental behaviors. Yet, if we are honest, we know that this is not always true. Citation Schloss PD
f998dab60e13c3df179653ab1f8014863e544ba1	Background. Sensitive diagnostic assays have increased the detection of viruses in asymptomatic individuals. The clinical significance of asymptomatic respiratory viral infection in infants is unknown. Methods. High-throughput, quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect 13 common respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal specimens collected during 2028 visits from 362 infants followed from near birth up to 12 months of age. Specimens were collected at monthly interval (months 1-6 and month 9) and during upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) episodes. Subjects were followed closely for acute otitis media (AOM) development. Results. Viruses were detected in 76% of 394 URTI specimens and 27% of asymptomatic monthly specimens. Rhinovirus was detected most often; multiple viruses were detected in 29% of the specimens. Generalized mixed-model analyses associated symptoms with increasing age and female sex; detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus was highly associated with symptoms. Increasing age was also associated with multiple virus detection. Overall, 403 asymptomatic viral infections in 237 infants were identified. Viral load was significantly higher in URTI specimens than asymptomatic specimens but did not differentiate cases of URTI with and without AOM complication. The rate of AOM complicating URTI was 27%; no AOM occurred following asymptomatic viral infections. AOM development was associated with increasing age and infection with RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. Conclusions. Compared to symptomatic infection, asymptomatic viral infection in infants is associated with young age, male sex, low viral load, specific viruses, and single virus detection. Asymptomatic viral infection did not result in AOM.
185e7951aa39e6b82e6712ce2ddf40266e67da88	Influenza causes seasonal outbreaks yearly and unpredictable pandemics with high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite significant efforts to address influenza, it remains a major threat to human public health. This issue is partially due to the lack of antiviral drugs with potent antiviral activity and broad reactivity against all influenza virus strains and the rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants. Moreover, designing a universal influenza vaccine that is sufficiently immunogenic to induce universal antibodies is difficult. Some novel epitopes hidden in the hemagglutinin (HA) trimeric interface have been discovered recently, and a number of antibodies targeting these epitopes have been found to be capable of neutralizing a broad range of influenza isolates. These findings may have important implications for the development of universal influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs. In this review, we focused on the antibodies targeting these newly discovered epitopes in the HA domain of the influenza virus to promote the development of universal anti-influenza antibodies or vaccines and extend the discovery to other viruses with similar conformational changes in envelope proteins.
1491d3a88b4f4039a776ad5ca7325a934b199524	Trichomonads have been infrequently reported in the feces of dogs where their pathogenicity remains uncertain. It is currently unknown whether Tritrichomonas foetus or Pentatrichomonas hominis is identified more commonly in dogs with trichomonosis or how often these infections are accompanied by concurrent enteric infectious agents. The objective of this study was to determine the identity of trichomonads present in a series of 38 unsolicited canine diarrheic fecal samples submitted for T. foetus diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing between 2007 and 2010. We also examined each fecal sample for an association of trichomonosis with concurrent infection using a convenient real-time PCR panel for nine gastrointestinal pathogens. P. hominis, T. foetus, or both were identified by PCR in feces of 17, 1, and 1 dogs respectively. Feces from the remaining 19 dogs were PCR negative for T. foetus, P. hominis and using broader-spectrum Trichomonadida primers. The total number and specific identities of concurrent enteropathogens identified did not differ between fecal samples from dogs that were or were not identified by PCR as infected with trichomonads. These results suggest that P. hominis infection is more frequently identified than T. foetus infection in diarrheic dogs with trichomonosis and that concurrent enteropathogen infection is common in this population.
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	Responses by resident cells are likely to play a key role in determining the severity of respiratory disease. However, sampling of the airways poses a significant challenge, particularly in infants and children. Here, we report a reliable method for obtaining nasal epithelial cell RNA from infants for genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, and describe baseline expression characteristics in an asymptomatic cohort. Nasal epithelial cells were collected by brushing of the inferior turbinates, and gene expression was interrogated by RNA-seq analysis. Reliable recovery of RNA occurred in the absence of adverse events. We observed high expression of epithelial cell markers and similarity to the transcriptome for intrapulmonary airway epithelial cells. We identified genes displaying low and high expression variability, both inherently, and in response to environmental exposures. The greatest gene expression differences in this asymptomatic cohort were associated with the presence of known pathogenic viruses and/or bacteria. Robust bacteria-associated gene expression patterns were significantly associated with the presence of Moraxella. In summary, we have developed a reliable method for interrogating the infant airway transcriptome by sampling the nasal epithelium. Our data demonstrates both the fidelity and feasibility of our methodology, and describes normal gene expression and variation within a healthy infant cohort. Sampling of the airway for research or diagnostic biospecimens in diseased infants is highly challenging. As compared to the tremendous progress made over the last decades in our understanding of adult lung diseases such as COPD and lung fibrosis 1-3 , this limitation has restricted progress in identifying the molecular mechanisms contributing to pediatric respiratory diseases. Many contemporary studies sample the upper airway, using aspirates of tracheal secretions in intubated subjects to collect intra-airway inflammatory cells and sloughed resident cells of the airway. The availability of these samples is limited to intubated subjects, introducing significant selection bias. Furthermore, the ability of these samples to reliably capture the cellular and molecular state of the lung is unclear. Other studies have analyzed nasal washings, which can be performed in a more broad population. Again, these samples are of unclear relevance to the pathophysiology of the lung. Brushings of nasal epithelial cells have been used for decades to diagnose primary ciliary dyskenesis (PCD), indicating that recovery of epithelial cells from the nose of non-acutely ill children and infants could provide molecular information that reflects abnormalities of physiological relevance in the distal airway. Furthermore, nasal brushings in adults and older pediatric patients have previously been used for interrogation of the transcriptome. These studies have generally shown that nasal brushings broadly capture gene expression with relevance to the airways 4 , and can detect disease-associated changes in gene expression 5 . We undertook the present study to determine if the recovery of nasal epithelial cells for transcriptomic analysis was feasible, and whether these data could provide molecular information of relevance to the more distal airways. We present a reliable procedure for sampling resident cells of the airway in healthy young infants, which is applicable to infants experiencing respiratory infectious disease (T. Mariani, unpublished observations), and likely to older ill and healthy pediatric subjects. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark healthy infant nasal transcriptome (HINT) data set, describing baseline expression and natural variation, for asymptomatic subjects. Our data demonstrates that it is technically feasible to quantify genome-wide RNA expression from young infant's airways, which may be helpful in the evaluation of host responses to diseased states. Subject Demographics and RNA-Seq Data Generation. Fifty-three healthy, full-term infants were recruited at birth. A majority of the subjects were female, predominantly Caucasian, and had a mean gestational age of 39.3 ± 1.0 (mean ± SD) weeks, with a mean birth weight of 3.3 ± 0.4 kg (Table 1) . Nasal brushing samples were obtained from the inferior nasal turbinate at approximately one month of age (see Methods). All samples were collected when infants were free of illness, specifically signs of respiratory infection or fever. RNA was purified for high throughput sequence analysis from the recovered nasal cells as outlined in Fig. 1 . RNA yields from the nasal brushings were variable with a mean recovery of 278.5 ± 436.7 ng (Fig. 2) . Due to variability in total RNA recovery, cDNA was generated from approximately 1 ng input RNA. As shown in Fig. 2 , the samples generated an average of 27 ± 6 million total reads, with 66 ± 14% displaying unique mapping to the human genome. After excluding genes whose expression was not robustly and reliably detected across subjects (see Methods), 13,978 genes or 63 ± 7% of the genome was transcriptionally represented in these samples.

39d57801c57e1abf6a5f5e9e05f9834a1dd7ee90	The potential for infection by coronaviruses (CoVs) has become a serious concern with the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the human population. CoVs encode two large polyproteins, which are then processed into 15-16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that make significant contributions to viral replication and transcription by assembling the RNA replicase complex. Among them, nsp9 plays an essential role in viral replication by forming a homodimer that binds single-stranded RNA. Thus, disrupting nsp9 dimerization is a potential anti-CoV therapy. However, different nsp9 dimer forms have been reported for alpha-and beta-CoVs, and no structural information is available for gamma-CoVs. Here we determined the crystal structure of nsp9 from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a representative gamma-CoV that affects the economy of the poultry industry because it can infect domestic fowl. IBV nsp9 forms a homodimer via interactions across a hydrophobic interface, which consists of two parallel alpha helices near the carboxy terminus of the protein. The IBV nsp9 dimer resembles that of SARS-CoV nsp9, indicating that this type of dimerization is conserved among all CoVs. This makes disruption of the dimeric interface an excellent strategy for developing anti-CoV Protein Data Bank Accession Codes: The Atomic coordinate and structure factors of IBV nsp9 were submitted to RCSB Protein Data Bank, with accession code 5C94. therapies. To facilitate this effort, we characterized the roles of six conserved residues on this interface using site-directed mutagenesis and a multitude of biochemical and biophysical methods. We found that three residues are critical for nsp9 dimerization and its abitlity to bind RNA. In this study, the dimeric nsp9 crystal structure of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was solved at 2.5 Å resolution. A hydrophobic region and two parallel a-helices were found to be essential for nsp9 dimerization. The dimeric state was independently evaluated using multiple biochemical methods, including mutagenesis, circular dichroism, size exclusion chromatography with in-line multi-angle light scattering analysis (SEC-MALs), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and analytical ultracentrifugation. This is the first time an nsp9 structure for a gamma-coronavirus has been determined.
f33a7a22553031a97abde837917b4a152bbb535a	Many countries have applied lockdown to suppress COVID-19, with devastating economic consequences. Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that suppress the epidemic and provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants that can be adapted in response to epidemiological observations, can in certain conditions suppress the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle reduces the reproduction number R by a combination of reduced exposure time and a resonance effect where those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing and extensive testing and contact tracing. Adaptive work-lockdown cycles can provide epidemic control and offer predictability to many economic sectors.
d647c6b65ee08b38ecbd2bb85de064df41f7cf0f	Background: Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions may provide simple, low-cost, effective ways of minimising the transmission and impact of acute respiratory infections in pandemic and non-pandemic contexts. Understanding what influences the uptake of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand and respiratory hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing could help to inform the development of effective public health advice messages. The aim of this synthesis was to explore public perceptions of non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim to reduce the transmission of acute respiratory infections. Methods: Five online databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science) were systematically searched. Reference lists of articles were also examined. We selected papers that used a qualitative research design to explore perceptions and beliefs about non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce transmission of acute respiratory infections. We excluded papers that only explored how health professionals or children viewed non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control. Three authors performed data extraction and assessment of study quality. Thematic analysis and components of meta-ethnography were adopted to synthesise findings. Results: Seventeen articles from 16 studies in 9 countries were identified and reviewed. Seven key themes were identified: perceived benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions, perceived disadvantages of non-pharmaceutical interventions, personal and cultural beliefs about infection transmission, diagnostic uncertainty in emerging respiratory infections, perceived vulnerability to infection, anxiety about emerging respiratory infections and communications about emerging respiratory infections. The synthesis showed that some aspects of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control (particularly hand and respiratory hygiene) were viewed as familiar and socially responsible actions to take. There was ambivalence about adopting isolation and personal distancing behaviours in some contexts due to their perceived adverse impact and potential to attract social stigma. Common perceived barriers included beliefs about infection transmission, personal vulnerability to respiratory infection and concerns about self-diagnosis in emerging respiratory infections. Conclusions: People actively evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions in terms of their perceived necessity, efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility. To enhance uptake, it will be necessary to address key barriers, such as beliefs about infection transmission, rejection of personal risk of infection and concern about the potential costs and stigma associated with some interventions.
7a069d606ef94f6added5d1fb1f14c7cb2087aa2	The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on societies and economies worldwide. Despite rapid advances in diagnostic test development and scale-up, there remains an ongoing need for SARS-CoV-2 tests which are highly sensitive, specific, minimally invasive, cost-effective, and scalable for broad testing and surveillance. Here we report development of a highly sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay on the automated HD-X platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in venous and capillary blood (fingerstick). In pre-pandemic and clinical sample sets, the assay has 100% specificity and 97.4% sensitivity for serum / plasma samples. The limit of detection (LoD) estimated by titration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus is 0.2 pg/ml, corresponding to 0.05 .

We consider both COVID-19 global and US figures and show that the sanitary crisis enhances the S&P 500 realized volatility. Our findings are robust to different model specifications and suggest that the prolongation of the coronavirus pandemic is an important source of financial volatility, challenging the risk management activity.
ed15083f3d69797042e057e56467f06df6eb3851	Background: Knowledge about parasitic infections is crucial information for animal health, particularly of free-ranging species that might come into contact with livestock and humans. We investigated the seroprevalence of three tissue-cyst-forming apicomplexan parasites (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Besnoitia besnoiti) in 506 individuals of 12 wildlife species in Namibia using in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (indirect ELISAs applying purified antigens) for screening and immunoblots as confirmatory tests. We included six species of the suborder Feliformia, four species of the suborder Caniformia and two species of the suborder Ruminantia. For the two species for which we had most samples and life-history information, i.e. cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus, n = 250) and leopards (Panthera pardus, n = 58), we investigated T. gondii seroprevalence in relation to age class, sex, sociality (solitary, mother-offspring group, independent sibling group, coalition group) and site (natural habitat vs farmland). Results: All but one carnivore species (bat-eared fox Otocyon megalotis, n = 4) were seropositive to T. gondii, with a seroprevalence ranging from 52.4% (131/250) in cheetahs to 93.2% (55/59) in African lions (Panthera leo). We also detected antibodies to T. gondii in 10.0% (2/20) of blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). Adult cheetahs and leopards were more likely to be seropositive to T. gondii than subadult conspecifics, whereas seroprevalence did not vary with sex, sociality and site. Furthermore, we measured antibodies to N. caninum in 15.4% (2/13) of brown hyenas (Hyaena brunnea) and 2.6% (1/39) of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas). Antibodies to B. besnoiti were detected in 3.4% (2/59) of African lions and 20.0% (4/20) of blue wildebeest. Our results demonstrate that Namibian wildlife species were exposed to apicomplexan parasites at different prevalences, depending on parasite and host species. In addition to serological work, molecular work is also needed to better understand the sylvatic cycle and the clear role of wildlife in the epidemiology of these parasites in southern Africa.
c0c7b00ab24cc387be12eab10e6eb3e304d24f7d	Carbon monoxide (CO), a gaseous second messenger, arises in biological systems during the oxidative catabolism of heme by the heme oxygenase (HO) enzymes. HO exists as constitutive (HO-2, HO-3) and inducible isoforms (HO-1), the latter which responds to regulation by multiple stress-stimuli. HO-1 confers protection in vitro and in vivo against oxidative cellular stress. Although the redox active compounds that are generated from HO activity (i.e. iron, biliverdin-IXα, and bilirubin-IXα) potentially modulate oxidative stress resistance, increasing evidence points to cytoprotective roles for CO. Though not reactive, CO regulates vascular processes such as vessel tone, smooth muscle proliferation, and platelet aggregation, and possibly functions as a neurotransmitter. The latter effects of CO depend on the activation of guanylate cyclase activity by direct binding to the heme moiety of the enzyme, stimulating the production of cyclic 3′:5′-guanosine monophosphate. CO potentially interacts with other intracellular hemoprotein targets, though little is known about the functional significance of such interactions. Recent progress indicates that CO exerts novel anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects dependent on the modulation of the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway. By virtue of these effects, CO confers protection in oxidative lung injury models, and likely plays a role in HO-1 mediated tissue protection. (Mol Cell Biochem 234/235: [249][250][251][252][253][254][255][256][257][258][259][260][261][262][263] 2002) 
3576b9e0d1895a2d2cb0231304425e1633e86e82	Reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 plays a key role in initiating viral replication and is an important target for developing anti-HIV drugs. Our previous study showed that two mutations (Y271A and I274A) in the turn RT (Gln 269 -Arg 277 ) abrogated viral replication, but the replication capacity and RT activity was discordant. In this study, we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication. We found that both RT activity and RT protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants, although the Pr160 gag-pol mutants were properly expressed, transported and incorporated. Using protease inhibition assay, we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the RT mutants and the activity of viral protease. Our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes, leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers, resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease. Thus, residues 271 and 274 are critical to RT stability and resistance to viral protease. The conservation of the two amino acid residues among different strains of HIV-1 lent further support to this conclusion. The knowledge gained here may prove useful in drug design.
44506a2f32ea24c30bc8441009f6e465938c6d4d	Background: COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by a new coronavirus strain. Innovative tests have been developed to diagnose and characterize the spread of COVID-19. Only a few studies have reported the diagnostic value of currently available tests. The diagnostic performance of the tests is a major concern after the recent resurgence in Methods: Published papers and FDA data on the currently available tests were used for analysis. Likelihood ratios, and predictive values of tests were computed. Only FDA approved tests were included. RT-PCR performance among different specimen types were also explored. Main results: All the published reports on the COVID-19 tests reported RT-PCR as the validation tool for their results. Not all available COVID-19 tests reported their sensitivity and speci city. Among the publications which reported, the positive likelihood ratio ranged between 0.15 to 0.88 and tests had high negative likelihood ratio (0.99). Conclusion: Although most recent publications showed high positive and negative likelihood ratios and high predictive values, the publications on test accuracy and validity have limited scope primarily due to their small sample size and insu ciencies in methodology and published data. Although most lab tests reported high sensitivity and speci city, false omission and false discovery rates were found notable in several COVID-19 lab tests. These results suggest need for caution on test results' interpretation. Practitioners also need to integrate evidence that is evolving rapidly.
2490a12ef4b700055d34bde4325a59ca90b8186e	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused economic losses in the Americas, Asia and Europe in recent years. Reliable serological assays are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect antibodies against different PEDV strains in pig serum. A total of 732 serum samples from North American or European pigs were tested. Samples included experimental samples from pigs infected with classical (G1a PEDV) or variant genogroup 1 PEDV (G1b PEDV), pandemic genogroup 2 PEDV (G2b PEDV) or non-infected controls. Field samples from herds with confirmed or unknown PEDV exposure were also used. Three indirect ELISAs based on G2b antigens (ELISAs 1, 2 and 3), a competitive ELISA based on the G2b antigen (ELISA 4) and a competitive ELISA based on the G1a antigen (ELISA 5) were compared. Overall, the tests had a moderate agreement ( = 0.61). G1a PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISA 3, G1b PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISAs 4 and 5 and the performance of all tests was similar for the G2b PEDV group. ELISA 1 showed the overall lowest detection on experimentally and field derived samples. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with a 95% probability interval were estimated to be 68.2% (62.1-74.4%) and 97.5% (95.2-99.0%) for ELISA 1, 73.7% (71.5-79.6%) and 98.4% (96.6-99.5%) for ELISA 2, 86.2% (81.1-90.6%) and 91.6% (87.7-94.8%) for ELISA 3, 78.3% (72.8-83.5%) and 99.7% (98.2-100%) for ELISA 4, and 93.5% (90.3-96.0%) and 91.2% (83.8-97.9%) for ELISA 5. Differences in detection among assays seem to be more related to intrinsic factors of an assay than to the PEDV antigen used.
1e863993819f87abe5cee255ccb97d623838542a	Background: Bocaviruses are classified as a genus within the Parvoviridae family of single-stranded DNA viruses and are pathogenic in some mammalian species. Two species have been previously reported in dogs, minute virus of canines (MVC), associated with neonatal diseases and fertility disorders; and Canine bocavirus (CBoV), associated with respiratory disease. Findings: In this study using deep sequencing of enriched viral particles from the liver of a dog with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, necrotizing vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis and anuric renal failure, we identified and characterized a novel bocavirus we named Canine bocavirus 3 (CnBoV3). The three major ORFs of CnBoV3 (NS1, NP1 and VP1) shared less than 60% aa identity with those of other bocaviruses qualifying it as a novel species based on ICTV criteria. Inverse PCR showed the presence of concatemerized or circular forms of the genome in liver. Conclusions: We genetically characterized a bocavirus in a dog liver that is highly distinct from prior canine bocaviruses found in respiratory and fecal samples. Its role in this animal's complex disease remains to be determined.
a2c2196aecd2142d5881124b7cd8ff252581c784	Pulmonary infection is a common complication after lung transplantation, and early detection is crucial for outcome. However, the condition can be clinically difficult to diagnose and to distinguish from rejection. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate heparin-binding protein (HBP), lysozyme, and the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as potential biomarkers for pulmonary infection in lung-transplanted patients. One hundred thirteen BALF samples from 29 lung transplant recipients were collected at routine scheduled bronchoscopies at 3 and 6 months, or on clinical indication. Samples were classified into no, possible, probable, or definite infection at the time of sampling. Rejection was defined by biopsy results. HBP, lysozyme, and cytokines were analyzed in BALF and correlated to likelihood of infection and rejection. All biomarkers were significantly increased in BALF during infection, whereas patients with rejection presented low levels that were comparable to noninfection samples. HBP, IL-1β, and IL-8 were the best diagnostic markers of infection with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values of 0.88, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively. In conclusion, HBP, IL-1β, and IL-8 could be useful diagnostic markers of pulmonary infection in lung-transplanted patients.

d765ae9259829b1ea41cf7c527023b86cad335ad	We study the political economy of allocation decisions within a major state investment bank. Our focus is the European Investment Bank (EIB) -"The Bank of the EU" -which is the largest multilateral lending (and borrowing) institution in the world. We study the behavior of about 500 national representatives at the EIB's Board of Directors -the bank's decisive body for loan approvals -and show that a representative's appointment increases the probability that the sub-national region where she works receives a loan by about 17 percentage points. This "home-bias" effect is driven by large loans financing infrastructure projects. We discuss several pieces of evidence, which are consistent with the hypothesis that this home-bias lending may be due to favoritism, however, we cannot conclusively demonstrate this case of resource misallocation.

b7d250c35c28644fc47ce18fb21bd8534d105353	J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SUMMARY There is an urgent need to identify antivirals against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to contain future similar emergencies early on. Specific side-chain cholesterol oxidation products of the oxysterols family have been shown to inhibit a large variety of both enveloped and non-enveloped human viral pathogens. Here we report on the in vitro inhibitory activity of the redox active oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol against SARS-CoV-2 and against one of the common cold agents HCoV-OC43 human coronavirus without significant cytotoxicity. Interestingly, physiological serum levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects were significantly decreased compared to the matched control group, reaching a marked 50% reduction in severe COVID-19 cases. Moreover, no correlation at all was observed between 24-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol serum levels and the severity of the disease. Opposite to that of 27-hydroxycholesterol was the behaviour of two recognized markers of redox imbalance, i.e. 7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, whose serum levels were significantly increased especially in severe COVID-19. The exogenous administration of 27-hydroxycholesterol may represent in the near future a valid antiviral strategy in the worsening of diseases caused by present and emerging coronaviruses. key words: coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, HCoV-OC43, cholesterol, oxysterols, 27hydroxycholesterol. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights 1) 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) markedly inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 by interfering with its entry into the target cells. 2) The broad antiviral effect of 27OHC is also exerted against another β-coronavirus, HCoV-OC43. 3) The physiological hematic levels of 27OHC were found to be decreased in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, especially in patients with severe COVID-19. 4) Increased serum levels of 7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, in vivo markers of oxidative stress, were detectable in COVID-19 patients but not in pauci-or a-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.

5bfd9a40e27ada726f348a238e9509989780aedf	Coronavirus (CoV) infections are commonly associated with respiratory and enteric disease in humans and animals. In 2012, a new human disease called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in the Middle East. MERS was caused by a virus that was originally called human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center/2012 but was later renamed as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV causes high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection, and multiorgan dysfunction that may eventually lead to the death of the infected individuals. The exact origin of MERS-CoV remains unknown, but the transmission pattern and evidence from virological studies suggest that dromedary camels are the major reservoir host, from which human infections may sporadically occur through the zoonotic transmission. Human to human transmission also occurs in healthcare facilities and communities. Recent studies on Middle Eastern respiratory continue to highlight the need for further understanding the virus-host interactions that govern disease severity and infection outcome. In this review, we have highlighted the major mechanisms of immune evasion strategies of MERS-CoV. We have demonstrated that M, 4a, 4b proteins and Plppro of MERS-CoV inhibit the type I interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways and therefore facilitate innate immune evasion. In addition, nonstructural protein 4a (NSP4a), NSP4b, and NSP15 inhibit doublestranded RNA sensors. Therefore, the mentioned proteins limit early induction of IFN and cause rapid apoptosis of macrophages. MERS-CoV strongly inhibits the activation of T cells with downregulation of antigen presentation. In addition, uncontrolled secretion of interferon ɣ-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 can suppress proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells.
23fa93028034e092a7bc53c397c7d0ae365e1055	Marine sponges and their associated bacteria have been proven to be a rich source of novel secondary metabolites with therapeutic usefulness in cancer, infection, and autoimmunity. In this study, 79 strains belonging to 20 genera of the order Actinomycetales and seven strains belonging to two genera of the order Sphingomonadales were cultivated from 18 different Caribbean sponges and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Seven of these strains are likely to represent novel species. Crude extracts from selected strains were found to exhibit protease inhibition against cathepsins B and L, rhodesain, and falcipain-2 as well as immunomodulatory activities such as induction of cytokine release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results highlight the significance of marine sponge-associated bacteria to produce bioactive secondary metabolites with therapeutic potential in the treatment of infectious diseases and disorders of the immune system.
07bf7b392feb438d436be66e2bdfe7513320231b	Background: In South Korea, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in 2015. It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). : We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5-2.5. Conclusions: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.
78057e9db3bebe6ecfc99fbc036414ebd4115cfd	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) provides the reducing agent NADPH to meet the cellular needs for reductive biosynthesis and the maintenance of redox homeostasis. G6PD-deficient cells experience a high level of oxidative stress and an increased susceptibility to viral infections. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key mediator in the regulation of viral replication and inflammatory response. In the current study, the role of G6PD on the inflammatory response was determined in both scramble control and G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) A549 cells upon tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation. A decreased expression pattern of induced COX-2 and reduced production of downstream PGE 2 occurred upon TNF-α stimulation in G6PD-kd A549 cells compared with scramble control A549 cells. TNF-α-induced antiviral activity revealed that decreased COX-2 expression enhanced the susceptibility to coronavirus 229E infection in G6PD-kd A549 cells and was a result of the decreased phosphorylation levels of MAPK (p38 and ERK1/2) and NF-κB. The impaired inflammatory response in G6PD-kd A549 cells was found to be mediated through NADPH oxidase (NOX) signaling as elucidated by cell pretreatment with a NOX2-siRNA or NOX inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). In addition, NOX activity with TNF-α treatment in G6PD-kd A549 cells was not up-regulated and was coupled with a decrease in NOX subunit expression at the transcriptional level, implying that TNF-α-mediated NOX signaling requires the participation of G6PD. Together, these data suggest that G6PD deficiency affects the cellular inflammatory response and the decreased TNF-α-mediated antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells is a result of dysregulated NOX/MAPK/NF-κB/ COX-2 signaling.

Often they rely on only superficial rote learning, which might lead to medical errors. We have 30 developed a lesson plan that is based on this educational need using Gagné´s Instructional Design for the example of 31 teaching the complex preoperative management of diabetic patients. Our aim was to use Gagne's approach 32 successfully for the teaching of non-procedural skills. Methods: We implemented a comprehensive lesson plan that was developed on the example of a clinical pattern -34 the preoperative assessment of diabetic patients -using Gagné´s systematic nine-step model of instruction design. After the lesson, we analysed the trainees´ opinions with the use of a standardized questionnaire. 36 Results: Nine trainees with 2.1± 0.8 years of anesthesia experience attended the lesson. The assessment of 37 knowledge revealed in 82% the correct answers to the treatment options, and the residents' overall view on the 38 lecture concept were 4.8±0.3 for lecture concept and realization and 4.7±0.5 regarding motivation, participation and 39 climate. 40 Conclusions: Applying Gagné´s Instructional Design model guides seems to effectively guide the development of a 41 comprehensive lesson plan to teach non-procedural skills in a small group setting. 42 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 65 skills education [20, 22-24, 26, 27], although it is significantly less used for the teaching of knowledge as described 66 herein. 67 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 93 6) Elicit the performance: This step allowed the trainees to practice and train for the correct prescriptions.

294653ff998d4bbea9629786336c7d2848ff7dd9	Background: Numerous cases of swine-origin 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (H1N1)-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) bridged by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy have been reported; however, complication rates are high. We present our experience with H1N1-associated ARDS and successful bridging of lung function using superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) in combination with continuous positive airway pressure/assisted spontaneous breathing (CPAP/ASB). Methods: We admitted five patients with H1N1 infection and ARDS to our intensive care unit. Although all patients required pure oxygen and controlled ventilation, oxygenation was insufficient. We applied SHFJV/CPAP/ ASB to improve oxygenation. Results: Initial PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio prior SHFJV was 58-79 mmHg. In all patients, successful oxygenation was achieved by SHFJV (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio 105-306 mmHg within 24 h). Spontaneous breathing was set during first hours after admission. SHFJV could be stopped after 39, 40, 72, 100, or 240 h. Concomitant pulmonary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection was observed in all patients. Two patients were successfully discharged. The other three patients relapsed and died within 7 weeks mainly due to combined HSV infection and in two cases reoccurring H1N1 infection. Conclusions: SHFJV represents an alternative to bridge lung function successfully and improve oxygenation in the critically ill.
d4175631d7adc7efaa7c91d5c3f9196e0c759355	Zoonotic pathogens and parasites that are transmitted from vertebrates to humans are a major public health risk with high associated global economic costs. The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources. 2. We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research. 3. The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the moststudied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa. 4. Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied. 5. Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals.
998548cf6bc83b4dfc9d061a2a4425cc9506e82e	Objectives: We describe newly established guidance for guideline developers at the World Health Organization (WHO) on the process and procedures for developing a rapid advice guideline in the context of a public health emergency (e.g., the 2014 Ebola epidemic). Study Design and Setting: We based our approach on established rapid review methods, which were incorporated into existing WHO guideline development processes. Guidance was further informed by in-depth discussions of issues related to rapid guideline development with WHO staff (n 5 6), who oversee the Organization's response to emergencies. Results: We discuss criteria for considering if a rapid advice guideline is appropriate and feasible and outline the roles of various contributors across the phases of development. Further, we describe the methods and steps involved in performing rapid reviews, which are more fluid and iterative than for a standard guideline process. In general, rapid advice guidelines involve a shorter timeline, narrower scope, and the use of abbreviated methods for the evidence review. Conclusion: Important differences exist between developing a standard guideline and a rapid advice guideline. However, the core principles for WHO guidelines apply to rapid advice guidelines including minimizing bias, applying transparent processes and the use of explicit methods. Ó 2016 The Authors.

afe1861fef59382bfe9d04ab9d55a7ea24e8bcdd	COVID-19 has created havoc in the world by causing thousands of demises in a short period of time. Up till now, several attempts have been made for potential therapeutics against SARS-COV2. In this retrospective, single-center study, we extracted data from 122 COVID-19, RT-PCR confirmed patients. who were treated with a new treatment strategy of lianhuaqingwen with Arbidol Hydrochloride. The patients were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms for COVID-19 disease. Of 122 patients 21 ( 17.21%) patients undergo severe conditions of COVID-19, However total 111 (90.9 %) experienced mild symptoms such as fever in 93 (76.22%) patients, cough in 23 (20.17%) and muscle pain were observed in total 8 (7%) patients. showed effects in 5-7 days for patients with mild symptoms and was found effective with 98 % recovery rate. We found the new combination is very effective against patients with mild symptoms and asymptomatic patients. Further extensive clinical investigations are required.
da93732bae58cd4d177dab387dc3804b1eaf4e56	Leukocyte migration is controlled by a membrane-based chemosensory pathway on the leading edge pseudopod that guides cell movement up attractant gradients during the innate immune and inflammatory responses. This study employed single cell and population imaging to investigate drug-induced perturbations of leading edge pseudopod morphology in cultured, polarized RAW macrophages. The drugs tested included representative therapeutics (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) as well as control drugs (PDGF, Gö 6976, wortmannin). Notably, slow addition of any of the four therapeutics to cultured macrophages, mimicking the slowly increasing plasma concentration reported for standard oral dosage in patients, yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology. This finding is consistent with the well established clinical safety of these drugs. However, rapid drug addition to cultured macrophages revealed four distinct classes of effects on the leading edge pseudopod: (i) non-perturbing drug exposures yielded no detectable change in pseudopod morphology (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac); (ii) adaptive exposures yielded temporary collapse of the extended pseudopod and its signature PI(3,4,5)P 3 lipid signal followed by slow recovery of extended pseudopod morphology (ibuprofen, acetaminophen); (iii) disruptive exposures yielded long-term pseudopod collapse (Gö 6976, wortmannin); and (iv) activating exposures yielded pseudopod expansion (PDGF). The novel observation of adaptive exposures leads us to hypothesize that rapid addition of an adaptive drug overwhelms an intrinsic or extrinsic adaptation system yielding temporary collapse followed by adaptive recovery, while slow addition enables gradual adaptation to counteract the drug perturbation in real time. Overall, the results illustrate an approach that may help identify therapeutic drugs that temporarily inhibit the leading edge pseudopod during extreme inflammation events, and toxic drugs that yield long term inhibition of the pseudopod with negative consequences for innate immunity. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of drug-induced pseudopod collapse, as well as the mechanisms of adaptation and recovery following some inhibitory drug exposures.
664d7e731b7c05c755822f71779cf372e1938890	Wuhan coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by January 30, 2020. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.

Abernathy et al. show that viral nuclease-triggered mRNA decay leads to repression of cellular transcription and decreased RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment. RNAPII-transcribed viral genes escape this transcriptional repression, highlighting how viruses use this mRNA decay-transcription feedback mechanism for their benefit. Gamma-herpesviruses encode a cytoplasmic mRNA-targeting endonuclease, SOX, that cleaves most cellular mRNAs. Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular 5 0 -3 0 mRNA exonuclease Xrn1, thereby suppressing cellular gene expression and facilitating viral evasion of host defenses. We reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus. Measuring RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. The transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial viral endonuclease-induced cleavage, but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases. In particular, Xrn1 catalytic activity is required for transcriptional repression. Notably, viral mRNA transcription escapes decayinduced repression, and this escape requires Xrn1. Collectively, these results indicate that mRNA decay rates impact transcription and that gamma-herpesviruses use this feedback mechanism to facilitate viral gene expression.
9a3fe85f66a576dd0f7ee52577b7bd2d873f4cf7	Zusammenfassung Das Management nicht-finanzieller Risiken wie ESG-, Nachhaltigkeits-und Compliance-Risiken stellt Unternehmen vor große Herausforderungen. Im Gegensatz zu finanziellen Risiken ist zu nicht-finanziellen Risiken nur wenig Information verfügbar. Dies erschwert ein effektives Management erheblich. Unternehmen haben in den letzten Jahren hohe Verluste durch nicht-finanzielle Risiken erlitten. Die Corporate Governance dieser Risiken wirft zahlreiche, ungelöste Fragen auf. Dieser Beitrag skizziert mögliche Lösungsansätze und Thesen zum Einfluss der Informationsqualität. Bei diesen Fragen fühlt sich die Praxis von den Hochschulen allein gelassen. Eine Kooperation von Praxis und Hochschule zur Lösung der Fragen eröffnet attraktive Forschungsfelder für Hochschulen. Daher zeigt dieser Beitrag auch eine Forschungsagenda für Hochschulen auf. Schlüsselwörter Nicht-finanzielle Risiken · Informationsqualität · Herausforderungen an Corporate Governance · Forschungsagenda Abstract The management of non-financial risks such as ESG-, sustainability-and compliance risks poses a great challenge for companies. In contrast to financial risks the information on non-financial risks is very limited. This renders management quite difficult. Companies incurred big losses due to non-financial risks in recent years. Corporate governance of these risks raises many unresolved questions. This paper delineates potential answers and hypotheses about the impact of information quality. G. Franke ( ) K Practitioners complain about the lack of support from academia. A cooperation of practitioners and academics to resolve these questions presents attractive research fields for academia. Thus, this paper also presents a research agenda for academia.
18d98e0e2c6a5107ef20cf5d0b536eb2b36f259b	During a pandemic, robust estimation of case fatality rates (CFRs) is essential to plan and control suppression and mitigation strategies. At present, estimates for the CFR of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection vary considerably. Expert consensus of 0.1-1% covers in practical terms a range from normal seasonable Influenza to Spanish Influenza. In the following, I deduce a formula for an adjusted Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) to assess mortality in a period following a positive test adjusted for selection bias. Official datasets on cases and deaths were combined with data sets on number of tests. After data curation and quality control, a total of IFR (n=819) was calculated for 21 countries for periods of up to 26 days between registration of a case and death. Estimates for IRFs increased with length of period, but levelled off at >9days with a median for all 21 countries of 0.11 (95%-CI: 0.073-0.15). An epidemiologically derived IFR of 0.040 % (95%-CI: 0.029%-0.055%) was determined for Iceland and was very close to the calculated IFR of 0.057% (95%-CI: 0.042-0.078), but 2.7-6-fold lower than CFRs. IFRs, but not CFRs, were positively associated with increased proportions of elderly in age-cohorts (n=21, spearman's =.73, p =.02). Real-time data on molecular and serological testing may further displace classical diagnosis of disease and its related death. I will critically discuss, why, how and under which conditions the IFR, provides a more solid early estimate of the global burden of a pandemic than the CFR.
9547b74fb56cd1288d9af6facbd337148cf45895	INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory failure has been one of the most important causes of death in intensive care units, and certain aspects of its pulmonary pathology are currently unknown. The objective was to describe the demographic data, etiology, and pulmonary histopathological findings of different diseases in the autopsies of patients with acute respiratory failure. METHOD: Autopsies of 4,710 patients with acute respiratory failure from 1990 to 2008 were reviewed, and the following data were obtained: age, sex, and major associated diseases. The pulmonary histopathology was categorized as diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia. The odds ratio of the concordance between the major associated diseases and specific autopsy findings was calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Bacterial bronchopneumonia was present in 33.9% of the cases and cancer in 28.1%. The pulmonary histopathology showed diffuse alveolar damage in 40.7% (1,917) of the cases. A multivariate analysis showed a significant and powerful association between diffuse alveolar damage and bronchopneumonia, HIV/AIDS, sepsis, and septic shock, between liver cirrhosis and pulmonary embolism, between pulmonary edema and acute myocardial infarction, between dilated cardiomyopathy and cancer, between alveolar hemorrhage and bronchopneumonia and pulmonary embolism, and between lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia and HIV/ AIDS and liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchopneumonia was the most common diagnosis in these cases. The most prevalent pulmonary histopathological pattern was diffuse alveolar damage, which was associated with different inflammatory conditions. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the complete pathophysiological mechanisms involved with each disease and the development of acute respiratory failure.
e3fb47b53690d912c46406193452baa372e48d86	To explore the clinical characteristics of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. The clinical data of 164 COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were extracted and analysed retrospectively. In total, 505 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: those with gastrointestinal symptoms (G group) and those without gastrointestinal symptoms (NG group). Common gastrointestinal symptoms included inappetence, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Significantly higher proportions of patients with fever, dizziness, myalgia, and fatigue were noted in group G than in group NG. Compared with patients without fever, there was a significant difference between G group and NG group in moderate fever or above, while there was no significant difference between the two groups in low fever. The laboratory results showed that patients in the G group had significantly higher C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase levels than those in the NG group. Moreover, the proportion of patients with severe pneumonia was significantly higher in the G group than in the NG group. In Wuhan, the proportion of COVID-19 patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms is relatively high. Patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to suffer from severe pneumonia, which may help clinicians identify patients at high risk of COVID-19 and thus reduce the incidence of this condition.
58285ec3fbe337e244ececa569ec0eb569517b8b	Background: Substantial limitations have been imposed on passenger air travel to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between regions and countries. However, as case numbers decrease, air travel will gradually resume. We considered a future scenario in which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal. Under that scenario, there will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases. We estimated the risk of different locations acting as sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks elsewhere. We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks. We use a probabilistic, branching-process based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at each location, accounting for local population density. Under the scenario we model, we identify airports in East Asia as having the highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks. Moreover, we investigate the locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and potentially vulnerable to outbreaks: India, Brazil and Africa. We find that outbreaks in India and Brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those regions. We find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions, such as the United States, Europe, and China. However, outbreaks in Africa due to imported cases are instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent. Conclusions: Variation in flight volumes and destination population densities create a non-uniform distribution of the risk that different airports pose of acting as the source of an outbreak. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of outbreak risk can therefore facilitate optimal allocation of resources for effective targeting of public health interventions.
a99a88399b2acaf5b914d911e9011bdc6bfc93cb	The novel coronavirus, later identified as SARS-CoV-2, originating from Wuhan 24 in China in November 2019, quickly spread around the world becoming a 25 pandemic. Despite the knowledge of previous coronaviruses, such as those 26 responsible for the SARS and MERS-CoV epidemic, there is no drug or 27 prophylaxis treatment to this day. The rapid succession of scientific findings on 28 SARS-CoV-2 provides a significant number of potential drug targets. 29 Nevertheless, at the same time, the high quantity of clinical data, generated by a 30 large number of rapidly infected people, require accurate tests regarding effective 31 medical treatments. Several in vitro and in vivo studies were rapidly initiated after 32 the outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19. Initial clinical studies revealed the 33 promising potential of remdesivir that demonstrated a powerful and specific in 34 vitro antiviral activity for COVID-19. Promising effects appear to be attributable 35 to hydroxychloroquine. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are being tested in 36 ongoing randomized trials. In contrast, oseltamivir was not effective and 37 corticosteroids are not currently recommended. However, few data from ongoing 38 clinical trials are identifying low molecular weight heparins, innate immune 39 system stimulating agents, and inflammatory modulating agents as potential 40 effective agents. 41 The authors assume that the current pandemic will determine the need for a 42 systematic approach based on big data analysis for identifying effective drugs to 43 defeat SARS-Cov-2. This work is aimed to be a general reference point and to 44 3 provide an overview as comprehensive as possible regarding the main clinical trials 45 in progress at the moment. 46 47
29bea86b0ba016595710141d2e9ad5775438fbfa	Canada's history of nation building, combined with its status as a so-called middle power in international affairs, has been translated into an approach to global health that is focused on equity and global citizenship. Canada has often aspired to be a socially progressive force abroad, using alliance building and collective action to exert influence beyond that expected from a country with moderate financial and military resources. Conversely, when Canada has primarily used economic self-interest to define its global role, the country's perceived leadership in global health has diminished. Current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal federal government has signalled a return to progressive values, driven by appreciation for diversity, equality, and Canada's responsibility to be a good global citizen. However, poor coordination of efforts, limited funding, and the unaddressed legacy of Canada's colonisation of Indigenous peoples weaken the potential for Canadians to make meaningful contributions to improvement of global health equity. Amid increased nationalism and uncertainty towards multilateral commitments by some major powers in the world, the Canadian federal government has a clear opportunity to convert its commitments to equity and global citizenship into stronger leadership on the global stage. Such leadership will require the translation of aspirational messages about health equity and inclusion into concrete action at home and internationally.
4375209ab5826b2fab6be0f440c4b401e396e0f9	The exponential increase in COVID-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare systems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques (RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity. Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further, we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly available covid-chestxray-dataset [2] dataset, our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100% sensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection. We significantly improve upon the results of Covid-Net [10] on the same dataset.
f507c568b62cd0c91e520d975494d5c5928b8074	Observational data suggest an acquired prothrombotic state may contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. These data include elevated D-dimers observed among many COVID-19 patients. We present a retrospective analysis of admission D-dimer, and D-dimer trends, among 1065 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients, across 6 New York Hospitals. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were intubation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Three-hundred-thirteen patients (29.4%) died, 319 (30.0%) required intubation, and 30 (2.8%) had diagnosed VTE. Using Cox proportional-hazard modeling, each 1ug/ml increase in admission D-dimer level was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95%CI 1.04-1.08, p<0.0001) for death, 1.08 (95%CI 1.06-1.10, p<0.0001) for intubation, and 1.08 (95%CI 1.03-1.13, p=0.0087) for VTE. Time-dependent receiver-operator-curves for admission D-dimer as a predictor of death, intubation, and VTE yielded areas-under-the-curve of 0.694, 0.621, and 0.565 respectively. Joint-latent-class-modeling identified distinct groups of patients with respect to D-dimer trend. Patients with stable D-dimer trajectories had HRs of 0.29 (95%CI 0.17-0.49, p<0.0001) and 0.22 (95%CI 0.10-0.45, p=0.0001) relative to those with increasing D-dimer trajectories, for the outcomes death and intubation respectively. Patients with low-increasing D-dimer trajectories had a multivariable HR for VTE of 0.18 (95%CI 0.05-0.68, p=0.0117) relative to those with high-decreasing D-dimer trajectories. Time-dependent receiveroperator-curves for D-dimer trend as a predictor of death, intubation, and VTE yielded areasunder-the-curve of 0.678, 0.699, and 0.722 respectively. Although admission D-dimer levels, and D-dimer trends, are associated with outcomes in COVID-19, they have limited performance characteristics as prognostic tests.

474bb549cc1aad5a4bb2cb06ad1466f9a7b9ccb7	As COVID-19 has spread across the globe, quarantines and sheltering-in-place orders have become important public health tools but, as currently implemented, have eroded human rights, particularly for the marginalized, including essential workers, detainees, women, and children. Quarantines and sheltering-in-place orders must include explicit guarantees of human rights protections. We outline protections for the quarantined that communities and governments should strive to guarantee.
3621c51926a3c013cc756f5f4b5b996db2b87883	This paper illustrates how chronic uncertainty caused by crisis events affects the availability of entrepreneurial sources of finance for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To explore this line of argument, this paper examines Crunchbase real-time data examining entrepreneurial finance investments in China during unfolding Covid-19 crisis. The paper shows that these equity investments slumped dramatically in the immediate aftermath of the Covid-19 virus, resulting in a year on year decrease of 60% in the total volume of investment raised between quarter 1 in 2019 and quarter 1 in 2020. Importantly, the paper found early-stage seed investments falling the steepest, suggesting nascent start-ups are those most heavily affected by the crisis. While the global financial crisis heavily hit debt markets, the relational nature of equity investments may mean entrepreneurial finance is even more susceptible to major upheaval caused by the Covid-19 crisis. Overall, enterprise policy makers need to become better attuned at monitoring real-time data sources to mitigate chronic entrepreneurial uncertainty via strategic policy responses.
f5fd3ec29c6713894bd4181cf86c9237e26a5882	Background and goal: Surveillance systems for communicable diseases are primarily passive in most countries, including Iran. Laboratory-based surveillance and use of cell phone surveillance may be a useful method. Material and method: We established a new model for gathering data directly from district laboratories to regional laboratories and from them to national manager of public health laboratories by using cell phone. We assessed the coverage of Mobile and Cell phone in the laboratory Technicians, and Directors of Public Health in 27 universities in Iran by a simple data collection form to evaluate the feasibility of this method. And then this method was piloted for the last Cholera out break in Iran in 2005. Result: From data of 27 universities with 184 cities, we gathered 769 data health directorsÕ mobile , total mobile penetrating rate, SMS users, and SMS penetrating rate was 57.9%, 77.1%, and 44.6% between Directors in Medical Universities of Iran and 54.5%, 54.9% and 29.9% in Directors of Laboratory. In the Cholera epidemic in Iran in summer 2005, CDC of MOH registered near 900 cases of cholera from 70000 rectal soapÕs exam in whole of country. The median reporting interval was under one day. Conclusion: Although the advent of the cell phone will probably change the way in which surveillance is delivered by health system, further studies are warranted to evaluate this method for laboratory based surveillance of lethal infections.

c03bbc08094d829261ec4e94b52a0c2b65027e31	Background: Global Health has increasingly gained international visibility and prominence. First and foremost, the spread of cross-border infectious disease arouses a great deal of media and public interest, just as it drives research priorities of faculty and academic programmes. At the same time, Global Health has become a major area of philanthropic action. Despite the importance it has acquired over the last two decades, the complex collective term "Global Health" still lacks a uniform use today. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to present the existing definitions of Global Health, and analyse their meaning and implications. The paper emphasises that the term "Global Health" goes beyond the territorial meaning of "global", connects local and global, and refers to an explicitly political concept. Global Health regards health as a rights-based, universal good; it takes into account social inequalities, power asymmetries, the uneven distribution of resources and governance challenges. Thus, it represents the necessary continuance of Public Health in the face of diverse and ubiquitous global challenges. A growing number of international players, however, focus on publicprivate partnerships and privatisation and tend to promote biomedical reductionism through predominantly technological solutions. Moreover, the predominant Global Health concept reflects the inherited hegemony of the Global North. It takes insufficient account of the global burden of disease, which is mainly characterised by noncommunicable conditions, and the underlying social determinants of health. Conclusions: Beyond resilience and epidemiological preparedness for preventing cross-border disease threats, Global Health must focus on the social, economic and political determinants of health. Biomedical and technocratic reductionism might be justified in times of acute health crises but entails the risk of selective access to health care. Consistent health-in-all policies are required for ensuring Health for All and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries. Global Health must first and foremost pursue the enforcement of the universal right to health and contribute to overcoming global hegemony.
24a61244c69f09bc9392bbbb4a97e881ee68dc5e	African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a dsDNA virus responsible for a severe, highly contagious, and lethal disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs. ASFV has brought enormous economic loss to a number of countries, and effective vaccine and therapy are still lacking. Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable detection of ASFV is important for disease surveillance and control. Herein, we developed a Cas12a-mediated portable paper assay to rapidly and precisely detect ASFV. We identified a robust set of crRNAs that recognized the highly conserved region of essential ASFV genes. The Cas12a-mediated detection assay showed low tolerance for mismatch mutations, and no cross-reactivity against other common swine pathogens. We further developed a paper-based assay to allow instrument-free detection of ASFV. Specifically, we applied gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugate to engineer homemade strips and combined it with Cas12a-mediated ASFV detection. This portable paper, instrument-free diagnostics, faithfully detected ASFV in swine samples, showing comparable sensitivity to the traditionally instrumentdependent qPCR method. Taking together, we developed a highly sensitive, instant, and economic Cas12a-mediated paper diagnostics of ASFV, with a great application potential for monitoring ASFV in the field.
11c51eee0040547cfa8d49a4cc753d00d30beb98	Recent advances in machine learning have led to computer systems that are humanlike in behaviour. Sentiment analysis, the automatic determination of emotions in text, is allowing us to capitalize on substantial previously unattainable opportunities in commerce, public health, government policy, social sciences, and art. Further, analysis of emotions in text, from news to social media posts, is improving our understanding of not just how people convey emotions through language but also how emotions shape our behaviour. This article presents a sweeping overview of sentiment analysis research that includes: the origins of the field, the rich landscape of tasks, challenges, a survey of the methods and resources used, and applications. We also discuss discuss how, without careful fore-thought, sentiment analysis has the potential for harmful outcomes. We outline the latest lines of research in pursuit of fairness in sentiment analysis.
a2ce11bc2aecd4381aa82ca33ca6f32792b99f17	Background. Persons with influenza can develop complications that result in hospitalization and death. These are most commonly respiratory related, but cardiovascular or neurologic complications or exacerbations of underlying chronic medical conditions may also occur. Patterns of complications observed during pandemics may differ from typical influenza seasons, and characterizing variations in influenza-related complications can provide a better understanding of the impact of pandemics and guide appropriate clinical management and planning for the future. Methods. Using a population-based surveillance system, we compared clinical complications using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis codes in adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza (n = 5270) or 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (H1N1pdm09; n = 4962). Results. Adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were younger (median age, 47 years) than those with seasonal influenza (median age, 68 years; P < .01), and differed in the frequency of certain underlying medical conditions. Whereas there was similar risk for many influenza-associated complications, after controlling for age and type of underlying medical condition, adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were more likely to have lower respiratory tract complications, shock/sepsis, and organ failure than those with seasonal influenza. They were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation, or die. Young adults, in particular, had 2-4 times the risk of severe outcomes from H1N1pdm09 than persons of the same ages with seasonal influenza. Conclusions. Although H1N1pdm09 was thought of as a relatively mild pandemic, these data highlight the impact of the 2009 pandemic on the risk of severe influenza, especially among younger adults, and the impact this virus may continue to have.

In this study, we estimated causes of pneumonia in young African and Asian children, using novel analytical methods applied to clinical and microbiological findings. We did a multi-site, international case-control study in nine study sites in seven countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. All sites enrolled in the study for 24 months. Cases were children aged 1-59 months admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. Findings Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41·8% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99·7% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (31·7%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10·6-97·3%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6·4% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3·2%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33·9%] of 56). Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5·9% (3·9-8·3). Viruses were less common (54·5%, 95% CrI 47·4-61·5 vs 68·0%, 62·7-72·7) and bacteria more common (33·7%, 27·2-40·8 vs 22·8%, 18·3-27·6) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (31·1%, 95% CrI 28·4-34·2) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirus-enterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79% or more of the site's aetiological fraction. Interpretation In our study, a small set of pathogens accounted for most cases of pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Preventing and treating a subset of pathogens could substantially affect childhood pneumonia outcomes.
0901e59a2eb2ffae9e7fd82f0f0ec30241e5c86c	Background Decline in mitochondrial function occurs with aging and may increase mortality. We discuss mitochondrial contribution to Covid-19 sepsis, specifically the complex interaction of innate immune function, viral replication, hyperinflammatory state, and HIF-α/Sirtuin pathways. Methods Articles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using the combination of terms "SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, sepsis, mitochondria, aging, and immunometabolism". Results Evidence indicates that mitochondria in senescent cells may be dysfunctional and unable to keep up with hypermetabolic demands associated with Covid-19 sepsis. Mitochondrial proteins may serve as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) activating innate immunity. Disruption in normal oxidative phosphorylation pathways contributes to elevated ROS which activates sepsis cascade through HIF-α/Sirtuin pathway. Viral-mitochondrial interaction may be necessary for replication and increased viral load. Hypoxia and hyper-inflammatory state contribute to increased mortality associated with Covid-19 sepsis. Conclusions Aging is associated with worse outcomes in sepsis. Modulating Sirtuin activity is emerging as therapeutic agent in sepsis. HIF-α, levels of mitochondrial DNA, and other mitochondrial DAMP molecules may also serve as useful biomarker and need to be investigated. These mechanisms should be explored specifically for Covid-19-related sepsis. Understanding newly discovered regulatory mechanisms may lead to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

Here we assessed SARS-CoV2 from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia alongside 21 sequences of SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoVs and MERS-CoV, the latter currently detected in this 22 AUTHOR SUMMARY 44 The emergence and subsequent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a unique challenge to countries all 45 over the world, including Saudi Arabia where cases of the related MERS are still being reported. 46 Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin. In our analysis, 47 SARS-CoV-2 were more closely related to bat SARS-like CoVs rather than to MERS-CoV (which 48 originated in Saudi Arabia) or SARS-CoV, confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen. 49 Recombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at 50 the origin of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The data shown here give hints on the origin of this virus 51 and may inform efforts on transmissibility, host adaptation and other biological aspects of this 52 virus. 53 54 157
0f2f61b5f46e2f714d0347514aed340f3719e50d	Background: Plausible disasters may yield hundreds or thousands of critically ill victims. However, most countries, including those with widely available critical care services, lack sufficient specialized staff, medical equipment, and ICU space to provide timely, usual critical care for a large influx of additional patients. Shifting critical care disaster preparedness efforts to augment limited, essential critical care (emergency mass critical care [EMCC]), rather than to marginally increase unrestricted, individual-focused critical care may provide many additional people with access to life-sustaining interventions. In 2007, in response to the increasing concern over a severe influenza pandemic, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care (hereafter called the Task Force) convened to suggest the essential critical care therapeutics and interventions for EMCC. Task Force suggestions: EMCC should include the following: (1) mechanical ventilation, (2) IV fluid resuscitation, (3) vasopressor administration, (4) medication administration for specific disease states (eg, antimicrobials and antidotes), (5) sedation and analgesia, and (6) select practices to reduce adverse consequences of critical illness and critical care delivery. Also, all hospitals with ICUs should prepare to deliver EMCC for a daily critical care census at three times their usual ICU capacity for up to 10 days. Discussion: By using the Task Force suggestions for EMCC, communities may better prepare to deliver augmented critical care in response to disasters. In light of current mass critical care data limitations, the Task Force suggestions were developed to guide preparedness but are not intended as strict policy mandates. Additional research is required to evaluate EMCC and revise the strategy as warranted. Key words: critical care surge capacity; disaster medicine; influenza pandemic; mass casualty medical care; medical surge capacity Abbreviations: ED ϭ emergency department; EMCC ϭ emergency mass critical care T he severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002-2003, recent natural disasters, burgeoning concern for intentional catastrophes, and the looming threat of a severe influenza pandemic have stimulated much recent debate about how to care for a surge of critically ill people. 1-12 Most countries, though, including those with widely available critical care services and investment in disaster preparedness, lack sufficient specialized staff, medical equipment, and ICU space to provide timely, usual critical care for a large influx of additional patients (see "Definitive Care for the Critically Ill During a Disaster: Current Capabilities and Limitations").

471dbde40b162d112bacc68148816f63e83ecd12	The rise of machine learning in image processing has created a gap between trainable data-driven and classical modeldriven approaches: While learning-based models often show superior performance, classical ones are often more transparent. To reduce this gap, we introduce a generic wavelet shrinkage function for denoising which is adaptive to both the wavelet scales as well as the noise standard deviation. It is inferred from trained results of a tightly parametrised function which is inherited from nonlinear diffusion. Our proposed shrinkage function is smooth and compact while only using two parameters. In contrast to many existing shrinkage functions, it is able to enhance image structures by amplifying wavelet coefficients. Experiments show that it outperforms classical shrinkage functions by a significant margin.
73e3d6f3f33c747bffbbb8122ab855bfb59676db	Objectives: We compared the expelled air dispersion distances during coughing from a human patient simulator (HPS) lying at 45u with and without wearing a surgical mask or N95 mask in a negative pressure isolation room. Methods: Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. Coughing bouts were generated by short bursts of oxygen flow at 650, 320, and 220L/min to simulate normal, mild and poor coughing efforts, respectively. The coughing jet was revealed by laser light-sheet and images were captured by high definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. Significant exposure was arbitrarily defined where there was $ 20% of normalized smoke concentration. Results: During normal cough, expelled air dispersion distances were 68, 30 and 15 cm along the median sagittal plane when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. In moderate lung injury, the corresponding air dispersion distances for mild coughing efforts were reduced to 55, 27 and 14 cm, respectively, p , 0.001. The distances were reduced to 30, 24 and 12 cm, respectively during poor coughing effort as in severe lung injury. Lateral dispersion distances during normal cough were 0, 28 and 15 cm when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. Conclusions: Normal cough produced a turbulent jet about 0.7 m towards the end of the bed from the recumbent subject. N95 mask was more effective than surgical mask in preventing expelled air leakage during coughing but there was still significant sideway leakage.
9f5b81d681de239d34d6a321e2abdc78f9094078	After months of restrictive containment efforts to fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, European countries are planning to reopen. To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of GeroScience infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso-and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We demonstrated a potential success of containment efforts, supporting an exit strategy. NCT04370067, 30.04.2020.
5b6b23d6d9785a64c65390921c4270973d1a4455	Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the 21 common cold to more severe diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and 22 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 23 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus 24 responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct 25 contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal 26 samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) 27 transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A 29 literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web 30 Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 31 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV 33 persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery 34 of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very 36 sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water 37 than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is 38 an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 39 23°C-25°C than at 4°C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in 40 surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further 41 research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and 42 concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes 44 within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect 45 human health from exposure to coronavirus through water. 46 47 48 49 50 51 61 of a wide spectrum of other diseases, such as conjunctivitis, respiratory symptoms, viral hepatitis, 62 infections of the central nervous system. 63 The most important waterborne enteric viruses belong to the families Caliciviridae (Norovirus), 64 Picornaviridae (Enterovirus and Hepatitis A virus) and Adenoviridae (Adenovirus) (WHO, 2017). 65 These viruses are often excreted at high titres in the faeces (and occasionally, at lower 66 concentrations, in urines) of infected humans (Rusinol and Girones, 2017). They have also been 67 detected from virtually all types of water: wastewater, seawater, fresh waters, groundwater and 68 drinking water and have been associated with drinking and recreational water outbreaks 69 4 (Bonadonna and La Rosa, 2019; Gall et al., 2015; La Rosa et al., 2012; Moreira and Bondelind; 70 Rusinol, and Girones, 2017). 71 Conversely, enveloped viruses, are structurally dissimilar to the enteric (non-enveloped) viruses, 72 and are believed to behave differently in water environments (Wigginton et al, 2015). This group of 73 viruses includes families such as Orthomyxoviridae (es. Influenza viruses), Paramyxoviridae 74 (measles virus, mumps virus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc.), Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae and 75 several others viruses. Among the enveloped viruses, coronaviruses (CoV) (order Nidovirales, 76 family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae) are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. 77 Coronavirinae, includes four genera, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Delta-coronavirus, of which the 78 first two host viruses infecting humans (Human Coronavirus, HCoV): HCoV-229E and HCoV-79 NL63 (alphacoronaviruses) and HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome 80 coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 81 (betacoronaviruses) (Cui et al., 2019). Moreover, several coronavirus are reported to infect wildlife, 82 pets or livestock, such as in the case of bat coronaviruses (BatCoV), porcine enteric diarrhoea CoV 83 (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), 84 bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and others (reviewed in Wong, 2019; Wang, 2019; Tekes, 2016; Amer, 85 2018). 86 HCoV are respiratory pathogens and their primary transmission mode is person-to-person contact 87 through respiratory droplets generated by breathing, sneezing, coughing, etc., and contact (direct 88 contact with an infected subject or indirect contact, trough hand-mediated transfer of the virus from 89 contaminated fomites to the mouth, nose, or eyes). Waterborne transmission has never been 90 demonstrated in humans, however detection of HCoV in the feces of infected patients has been 91 reported (Esper et al., 2010; Jevšnik et al., 2013; Risku et al., 2010; Vabret et al., 2006) , suggesting 92 the fecal-oral route may contribute to HCoV transmission. In 2003, the SARS-CoV was detected in 93 the feces of infected patients (Isakbaeva et al., 2004) and, during an outbreak in a residential 94 326 instead significantly higher (43.1%). Finally, the optimized ultrafiltration protocol adopted in the 327 study provided the highest recoveries for both viruses: 25.1% for MHV and 55.6% for phage MS2. Results of Ye and colleagues suggested that the PEG precipitation method, which is effective at 329 recovering non-enveloped viruses from water samples, may be not optimal for recovering infective 330 enveloped viruses, while ultrafiltration could be successfully applied for recovering CoV. However, 331 in this study, only small volumes of wastewater were tested using centrifugal ultrafilters. Since 332 viruses in water matrices may occur in very low numbers, there is a need for analytical methods 333 suitable to process large volumes of water. It was therefore concluded by the authors that further 334 progress could be made through the optimization of hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow 335 ultrafiltration to allow concentration of CoV in waters from larger volumes of water. 336 Abd-Elmaksoud and coworkers (2014) measured the effectiveness of glass wool filtration to 337 simultaneously concentrate a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in 338 runoff from agricultural fields using dairy manure as fertilizer. Viruses of bovine origin were used 339 to spike 20 liters of dechlorinated tap water, including Bovine Coronavirus (BoCoV), Bovine Viral 340 Diarrhea Virus types 1 and 2 (BVDV1 and BVDV2), Bovine Rotavirus group A (BoRV), and 341 Poliovirus 3 (Sabin). Moreover, E. coli O157:NM, and Campylobacter jejuni were selected as 342 bacterial pathogen. Three water turbidity levels were evaluated, prepared by mixing dried 343 agricultural soil into the 20 liters of water. After glass wool filtration, elution was performed with 344 3% beef extract-glycine buffer (pH 9.5), followed by flocculation with PEG 8000. Recovered 345 organisms were enumerated by qPCR. Results showed that glass wool filtration is a cost-effective 346 method for the concentration of several waterborne pathogens simultaneously. In details, the 347 average recoveries (across the different turbidity levels tested) were: 18.1% for BoCoV, 22.1% for 348 BoRV, 15.6% and 19.7% for BVDV1 and BVDV2 respectively. Higher recovery efficiencies were 349 obtained for the non-enveloped virus Poliovirus 3 (57.9%), and for the bacterial microorganisms E. 350 coli O157:NM (54.8 %) and C. jejuni (32.7%). However, the authors advised to use caution in the
31475a11907e6478f49c6fc97ecd178b0b03fa0f	Background: Respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of hospitalization in infants and young children and are typically caused by viral or, less commonly, bacterial pathogens. Existing non-molecular diagnostic methods have several drawbacks such as limited sensitivity, long turn-a-round time and limited number of pathogens that can be detected. Objectives: Nucleic acid amplification methods can increase sensitivity and enable the initiation of appropriate interventions without delay. Broad-spectrum detection and identification circumvent the use of individual diagnostic DNA or RNA based assays. At present, several commercial assays are available for broad-spectrum detection. Study design: We compared the performance of the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) with that of the Respifinder (Pathofinder, Maastricht, Netherlands) for 9 external quality assurance (EQA) panels (QCMD, Scotland) consisting of a total of 106 EQA samples. Results: Both the RVP and the Respifinder assay have an excellent specificity. Sensitivity was 33% and 78% for the RVP and the Respifinder assay, respectively. For both assays, sensitivity was low for weak positive samples. Discussion: The results of our study seem to indicate a better sensitivity for the Respifinder. Analysis of patient samples is necessary to evaluate the clinical performance.
5d7698a990270f5ebfa2c879d56187116acc7646	Background: Standardized Korean red ginseng extract has become the best-selling influenza-like illness (ILI) remedy in Korea, yet much controversy regarding the efficacy of the Korean red ginseng (KRG) in reducing ILI incidence remains. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the KRG extract on the ILI incidence in healthy adults. Methods/Design: We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at the onset of the influenza seasons. A total of 100 subjects 30-70 years of age will be recruited from the general populations. The subjects will be instructed to take 9 capsules per day of either the KRG extract or a placebo for a period of 3 months. The primary outcome measure is to assess the frequency of ILI onset in participated subjects. Secondary variable measures will be included severity and duration of ILI symptoms. The ILI symptoms will be scored by subjects using a 4-point scale. Discussion: This study is a randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the KRG extract compared to placebo and will be provided valuable new information about the clinical and physiological effects of the KRG extract on reduction of ILI incidence including flu and upper respiratory tract infections. The study has been pragmatically designed to ensure that the study findings can be implemented into clinical practice if KRG extract can be shown to be an effective reduction strategy in ILI incidence. Trial Registration: NCT01478009.
ebe66d4ec400974eb2dda51927c0951f0709f6bc	The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a newly emergent pathogen first identified in Wuhan, China, and responsible for the COVID-19 global pandemic. In this case report we describe a manifestation of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis with continuous peripheral embolization in a COVID-19-positive patient. The patient responded well to high-dose LMWH treatment with cessation of the embolic process. LEARNING POINTS • Raising awareness of possible complications of COVID-19. • To highlight the importance of the careful consideration of and dosage of anticoagulation in non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. KEYWORDS Endocarditis, mitral valve, ultrasound, COVID-19 A 76-year-old woman with arterial hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented to the emergency department with acute onset right-sided central facial palsy, dysphasia and dysarthria. A week earlier the patient had visited the local outpatient clinic with vertigo and fatigue. A weak systolic murmur was noted during auscultation. Due to the pandemic our hospital employed a rigid protocol for admission, dividing the emergency department into a regular section and a section for patients with suspected COVID-19 where testing for SARS-CoV-2 and adequate hygiene protocols were employed. No respiratory symptoms or other symptomatology was communicated at admission and the patient was admitted via the regular route. However, retrospective history taking revealed anosmia and ageusia 2 weeks before admission. Initial testing showed elevated D-dimer of 0.9 mg/l (ref <0.31 mg/l). Inflammatory parameters were all within normal ranges.
c1ec41c285a56c6eb7cbd4b154c5a0d4434a7a12	New coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) treatments and vaccines are under development to combat COVID-19. Several approaches are being used by scientists for investigation, including (1) various small molecule approaches targeting RNA polymerase, 3C-like protease, and RNA endonuclease; and (2) exploration of antibodies obtained from convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19. The coronavirus genome is highly prone to mutations that lead to genetic drift and escape from immune recognition; thus, it is imperative that sub-strains with different mutations are also accounted for during vaccine development. As the disease has grown to become a pandemic, B-cell and T-cell epitopes predicted from SARS coronavirus have been reported. Using the epitope information along with variants of the virus, we have found several variants which might cause drifts. Among such variants, 23403A>G variant (p.D614G) in spike protein B-cell epitope is observed frequently in European countries, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France, but seldom observed in China.
9d08aa9bb599cb599ceaa62f31cb480a5708a5d1	Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is an ongoing public health problem in Taiwan. The National Tuberculosis Registry Campaign, a case management system, was implemented in 1997. This study examined this monitoring system to identify and characterize delayed treatment of TB patients.
5c51ebd67d7cd75ad59decdf8fd6b07152d37818	To analyze the immune responses of DNA vaccine encoded different gene fragments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov), SARS-Cov gene fragments of membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), spike a (Sa), and spike b (Sb) proteins were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vector to form plasmids pcDNAM, pcDNAN, pcDNASa, and pcDNASb, respectively. After mice were immunized intramuscularly with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa-pcDNASb plasmid, blood was collected and serum was separated. Humoral immune response was detected with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cellular immune response of SARS-Cov DNA vaccines was detected with lymphoproliferation assay and cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay. Results show that cellular and humoral immune responses can be detected after immunization with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa-pcD-NASb plasmids in BALB/c mice. However, pcDNAM stimulated the highest cellular immune response than other plasmids, and pcDNASa-pcDNASb stimulated the highest humoral immune response in week 12. The present results not only suggest that DNA immunization with pcDNAM, pcDNAN or pcDNASa-pcDNASb could be used as potential DNA vaccination approaches to induce antibody in BALB/c mice, but also to illustrate that gene immunization with these SARS DNA vaccines different immune response characters.
1ac9aac4ecdf40363f1377cc08484db3dc4abf93	This study compared the performances of three commercial transmissible gastroenteritis virus/porcine respiratory coronavirus (TGEV/PRCV) blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using serum samples (n ϭ 528) collected over a 49-day observation period from pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Purdue (n ϭ 12), TGEV strain Miller (n ϭ 12), PRCV (n ϭ 12), or with virus-free culture medium (n ϭ 12). ELISA results were evaluated both with "suspect" results interpreted as positive and then as negative. All commercial kits showed excellent diagnostic specificity (99 to 100%) when testing samples from pigs inoculated with virus-free culture medium. However, analyses revealed differences between the kits in diagnostic sensitivity (percent TGEV-or PRCVseropositive pigs), and all kits showed significant (P Ͻ 0.05) cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV serum antibodies, particularly during early stages of the infections. Serologic cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV seemed to be TGEV strain dependent, with a higher percentage of PRCV-false-positive results for pigs inoculated with TGEV Purdue than for TGEV Miller. Moreover, the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive, regardless of the ELISA kit evaluated. IMPORTANCE Current measures to prevent TGEV from entering a naive herd include quarantine and testing for TGEV-seronegative animals. However, TGEV serology is complicated due to the cross-reactivity with PRCV, which circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide. Conventional serological tests cannot distinguish between TGEV and PRCV antibodies; however, blocking ELISAs using antigen containing a large deletion in the amino terminus of the PRCV S protein permit differentiation of PRCV and TGEV antibodies. Several commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs are available, but performance comparisons have not been reported in recent research. This study demonstrates that the serologic cross-reactivity between TGEV and PRCV affects the accuracy of commercial blocking ELISAs. Individual test results must be interpreted with caution, particularly in the event of suspect results. Therefore, commercial TGEV/PRCV blocking ELISAs should only be applied on a herd basis.
a39776a72fffb1862a9b00e083d11d5290917dc7	The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity, mortality, and strained healthcare systems worldwide. Thus, a search for modalities that can expedite and improve the diagnosis and management of this entity is underway. Recent data suggested the utility of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 by detecting an interstitial pattern (B-pattern). Hence, we aimed to pool the proportion of various reported lung abnormalities detected by LUS in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic review (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE until April 25, 2020) and a proportion meta-analysis. We included seven studies examining the role of LUS in 122 COVID-19 patients. The pooled proportion (PP) of B-pattern detected by lung ultrasound (US) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00 I 2 0%, Q 4.6). The PP of finding pleural line abnormalities was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.13-1.00 I 2 96%, Q 103.9), of pleural thickening was 0.54 (95% 0.11-0.95 I 2 93%, Q 61.1), of subpleural or pulmonary consolidation was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21-0.58 I 2 72%, Q 17.8), and of pleural effusion was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.00-0.37 I 2 93%, Q 27.3). Our meta-analysis revealed that almost all SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have abnormal lung US. The most common abnormality is interstitial involvement depicted as B-pattern. The finding from our review highlights the potential role of this modality in the triage, diagnosis, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. A sizable diagnostic accuracy study comparing LUS, computed tomography scan, and COVID-19-specific tests is warranted to further test this finding and to delineate the diagnostic and prognostic yield of each of these modalities.

5f959ece54acbb176943a8f39ec4fc92be3b3216	During the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, New York City became an international epicenter for this highly infectious respiratory virus. In anticipation of the unfortunate reality of community spread and high disease burden, the Anesthesia and Obstetrics and Gynecology departments at NewYork-Presbyterian / Columbia University Irving Medical Center, an academic hospital system in Manhattan, created an Obstetric Intensive Care Unit on Labor and Delivery to defray volume from the hospital's preexisting intensive care units. Its purpose was threefold: (1) to accommodate the anticipated influx of critically ill pregnant and postpartum patients due to novel coronavirus, (2) to care for critically ill obstetric patients who would previously have been transferred to a non-obstetric intensive care unit, and (3) to continue caring for our usual census of pregnant and postpartum patients, who are novel Coronavirus negative and require a higher level of care. In this chapter, we share key operational details for the conversion of a non-intensive care space into an obstetric intensive care unit, with an emphasis on the infrastructure, personnel and workflow, as well as the goals for maternal and fetal monitoring.
b2d17404926d143c3643a718b87b33127a034b2b	1 Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel 2 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of 3 the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global 4 community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted 5 diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and 6 support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. 7 We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 8 2019-nCoV outbreak. 9 Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on 10 January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or 11 working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in 12 information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and 13 treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. 14 Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the 15 information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the 16 local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, 17 particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under 18 quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) 19 and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both 20 strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority 21 of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital 22 treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV.

b7bc5d27327f14b1a42d8007d63996e7441df576	The need for critical care services has grown substantially in the last decade in most of the G8 nations. This increasing demand has accentuated an already existing shortage of trained critical care professionals. Recent studies argue that difficulty in recruiting an appropriate workforce relates to a shortage of graduating professionals and unhealthy work environments in which critical care professionals must work. Objective: This narrative review summarizes existing literature and experiences about the key work environment challenges reported within the critical care context and suggests best practices-implemented in hospitals or suggested by professional associations-which can be an initial step in enhancing patient care and professional recruitment and retention in our intensive care units, with particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of an appropriately trained and satisfied workforce. The experiences are categorized for the physical, emotional, and professional environments. A case study is appended to enhance understanding of the magnitude and some of the proposed remedies of these experiences.
4b13cd0f4c9499362fdee43b64d24eb13de46ba1	Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a life-saving technology that provides transient respiratory and circulatory support for patients with profound cardiogenic shock or refractory cardiac arrest. Among its potential complications, VA-ECMO may adversely affect lung function through various pathophysiological mechanisms. The interaction of blood components with the biomaterials of the extracorporeal membrane elicits a systemic inflammatory response which may increase pulmonary vascular permeability and promote the sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within the lung parenchyma. Also, VA-ECMO increases the afterload of the left ventricle (LV) through reverse flow within the thoracic aorta, resulting in increased LV filling pressure and pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, VA-ECMO may result in long-standing pulmonary hypoxia, due to partial shunting of the pulmonary circulation and to reduced pulsatile blood flow within the bronchial circulation. Ultimately, these different abnormalities may result in a state of persisting lung inflammation and fibrotic changes with concomitant functional impairment, which may compromise weaning from VA-ECMO and could possibly result in long-term lung dysfunction. This review presents the mechanisms of lung damage and dysfunction under VA-ECMO and discusses potential strategies to prevent and treat such alterations.
6f0884cd0165739dbf82a88c4630b87fda29e92e	J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights  A novel nucleic acid amplification method based on a whispering gallery mode active resonator.  This active resonator operates without tapered fiber coupling.  It emits a strong photoluminescence signal with low background in an aqueous environment.  This also offers an extremely low detection threshold down to a single copy within 10 min.  This active resonator provides a point-of-care system with low-cost, highsensitivity and simplicity. Recent advances in nucleic acid based testing using bio-optical sensor approaches have been introduced but most are based on hybridization between the optical sensor and the biomolecule and not on an amplification mechanism. Direct nucleic acid amplification on an optical sensor has several technical limitations, such as the sensitivity of the temperature sensor, instrument complexity, and high background signal. We here describe a novel nucleic acid amplification method based on a whispering gallery mode active resonator and discuss its potential molecular diagnostic application. By implanting nanoclusters as active compounds, this active resonator operates without tapered fiber coupling and emits a strong photoluminescence signal with low background in the wavelength of low absorption in an aqueous environment that is typical of biosensors. Our method also offers an extremely low detection threshold down to a single copy within 10 min due to the strong light-matter J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f interaction in a nano-gap structure. We envision that this active resonator provides a high refractive index contrast for tight mode confinement with simple alignment as well as the possibility of reducing the device size so that a point-of-care system with low-cost, highsensitivity and simplicity.
018b1dbd7930fbfa5a2fd5b5d6e6ac3e67aca830	Background: While the number of detected SARS-CoV-2 infections are widely available, an understanding of the extent of undetected cases is urgently needed for an effective tackling of the pandemic. The aim of this work is to estimate the true number of SARS-CoV-2 (detected and undetected) infections in several European Countries. The question being asked is: How many cases have actually occurred? in an open population, based on a day-wise estimator that allows for heterogeneity. The estimator is data-driven and can be easily computed from the distributions of daily cases and deaths. Uncertainty surrounding the estimates is obtained using bootstrap methods. Results: We focus on the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases at April 17th. Differences arise at the Country level, and we get estimates ranging from the 3.93 times of Norway to the 7.94 times of France. Accurate estimates are obtained, as bootstrapbased intervals are rather narrow. Many parametric or semi-parametric models have been developed to estimate the population size from aggregated counts leading to an approximation of the missed population and/or to the estimate of the threshold under which the number of missed people cannot fall (i.e. a lower bound). Here, we provide a methodological contribution introducing an upper bound estimator and provide reliable estimates on the dark number, i.e. how many undetected cases are going around for several European Countries, where the epidemic spreads differently.
5709e6d04771fd3207126fee6de4e7b607b6f21d	Introduction: Multicentric Castleman's Disease (MCD), a lymphoproliferative disorder associated with Human Herpes Virus-8 (HHV-8) infection, is increasing in incidence amongst HIV patients. This condition is associated with lymphadenopathy, polyclonal gammopathy, hepato-splenomegaly and systemic symptoms. A number of small studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, in treating this condition. Case presentation: We report the case of a 46 year old Zambian woman who presented with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, confusion, lymphadenopathy, and renal failure. She rapidly developed multiple organ failure following the initiation of treatment of MCD with rituximab. Following admission to intensive care (ICU), she received prompt multi-organ support. After 21 days on the ICU she returned to the haematology medical ward, and was discharged in remission from her disease after 149 days in hospital. Conclusion: Rituximab, the efficacy of which has thus far been examined predominantly in patients outside the ICU, in conjunction with extensive organ support was effective treatment for MCD with associated multiple organ failure. There is, to our knowledge, only one other published report of its successful use in an ICU setting, where it was combined with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and prednisolone. Reports such as ours support the notion that critically unwell patients with HIV and haematological disease can benefit from intensive care.
ae80fe12be5b66d621401a3bb005769f784f52cf	Background and Objective: The COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia and is estimated to have a high impact on the healthcare system. Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. Methods: In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. Results: The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macroavg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. Conclusions: As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here. The COVID-19 pandemic can be considered severe due to its high transmissibility and seriousness [4]. The impact in the healthcare system is also high due to the amount of people that needs ICU admission and mechanical ventilators for long periods [5] . In this scenario, early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. In this con-20 text, artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions can provide a cheap and accurate diagnosis for COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. The CXR is the primary radiographic exam to evaluate pneumonia, but it not as precise as the CT scan and has higher 25 misdiagnosis rates. Nevertheless, the CXR is still useful because it is cheaper, faster, expose the patient to less radiation and is more widespread than CT scan [6, 7] . The task of pneumonia identification is not easy, the professional reviewing the CXR needs to look for white patches in the lungs, the white patches are the lungs' air sacs filled with pus or water. However, these white 30 patches can also be confused with tuberculosis or bronchitis, for example. In this study, we aim to explore the identification of different types of pneumonia caused by multiple pathogens using only CXR images. Despite the CT scan being the gold standard for the pneumonia diagnosis, we focused only on CXR images due to its reduced cost, fast result and its general availability, 35 since the CT scan machines are still scarse and costly. Specifically, we considered pneumonia caused by viruses (COVID-19, SARS, MERS and Varicella), bacteria (Streptococcus) and fungi (Pneumocystis). Moreover, because of the recent pandemic which is ravaging the world, the main focus of this work is the COVID-19 pneumonia, and our principal goal is to reach the best possible 40 identification rate for it among other types of pneumonia and healthy lungs. To support that, we have taken into account two perspectives in the results' evaluation: first, we considered all classes mentioned above and summarized the results using a macro-avg F1-Score; second, we considered only the COVID-19 class and summarized the results using F1-Score. 45
ab8da309a4060c4f4a3774c3ec9e7ebdc5a3a74e	Introduction: Natalizumab blocks α4-integrins and is a prototypic agent for a series of anti-inflammatory drugs that impair trafficking of immune cells into the CNS. However, modulation of the access of immune cells to the CNS is associated with impaired immune surveillance and detrimental viral infections of the CNS. Here, we explored the potency of cellular immune responses within the CNS to protect against viral encephalitis in mice with T cell conditional disruption of VLA-4 integrin (α4β1) expression. Results: While VLA-4 expression in virus specific Th1 cells is non-redundant for their ability to access the CNS, α4-integrin deficient Th17 cells enter the CNS compartment and generate an inflammatory milieu upon intrathecal vaccinia virus (VV) infection. However, in contrast to Th1 cells that can adopt direct cytotoxic properties, Th17 cells fail to clear the virus due to insufficient Eomes induced perforin-1 expression. Conclusion: The quality of the intrathecal cellular antiviral response under conditions of impaired VLA-4 function jeopardizes host protection. Our functional in vivo data extend our mechanistic understanding of anti-viral immunity in the CNS and help to estimate the risk potential of upcoming therapeutic agents that target the trafficking of immune cells into distinct anatomical compartments.
57f7587c21f25f1d1542599749ad28af764cf8e6	Background: Leptospirosis morbidity and mortality rates in China have decreased since the 2000s. Further analyses of the spatiotemporal and demographic changes occurring in the last decade and its implication on estimates of disease burden are required to inform intervention strategies. In this study, we quantified the epidemiological shift and geographical heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis during 2005-2015 in China. We used reported leptospirosis case data from 1st January 2005 to 31st of December 2015 that routinely collected by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) to analyze the epidemiological trend and estimate the burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) over space, time, and demographical groups. Results: A total of 7763 cases were reported during 2005-2015. Of which, 2403 (31%) cases were the laboratoryconfirmed case. Since 2005, the notified incidence rate was gradually decreased (P < 0.05) and it was relatively stable during 2011-2015 (P > 0.05). During 2005-2015, we estimated a total of 10 313 DALYs were lost due to leptospirosis comprising a total of 1804 years-lived with disability (YLDs) and 8509 years-life lost (YLLs). Males had the highest burden of disease (7149 DALYs) compared to females (3164 DALYs). The highest burden estimate was attributed to younger individuals aged 10-19 years who lived in southern provinces of China. During 2005-2015, this age group contributed to approximately 3078 DALYs corresponding to 30% of the total DALYs lost in China. Yet, our analysis indicated a declining trend in burden estimates (P < 0.001) since 2005 and remained relatively low during 2011-2015. Low burden estimates have been identified in the endemic regions where infections principally distributed. Most of the changes in DALY estimates were driven by changes in YLLs. Conclusions: In the last 11-years, the burden estimates of leptospirosis have shown a declining trend across the country; however, leptospirosis should not be neglected as it remains an important zoonotic disease and potentially affecting the young and productive population in economically less-developed provinces in southern of China. In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the true incidence of leptospirosis. Strengthened surveillance in the endemic regions is, hence, substantially required to capture the actual prevalence to better control leptospirosis in China.
7812b2516941dcc3cdb591f771db1196f2527add	Epidemiological models are widely used to analyse the spread of diseases such as the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, all models are based on simplifying assumptions and on sparse data. This limits the reliability of parameter estimates and predictions. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the relevance of these limitations by performing a study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. We perform parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and model selection for a range of established epidemiological models. Amongst others, we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, parameter and prediction profile calculation algorithms. Our results show that parameter estimates and predictions obtained for several established models on the basis of reported case numbers can be subject to substantial uncertainty. More importantly, estimates were often unrealistic and the confidence / credibility intervals did not cover plausible values of critical parameters obtained using different approaches. These findings suggest, amongst others, that several models are oversimplistic and that the reported case numbers provide often insufficient information.
e07825b84017873f81ba1c3779aa62b0f481c477	Haematology patients receiving chemo-or immunotherapy are considered to be at greater risk of COVID-19related morbidity and mortality. We aimed to identify risk factors for COVID-19 severity and assess outcomes in patients where COVID-19 complicated the treatment of their haematological disorder. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 55 patients with haematological disorders and COVID-19, including 52 with malignancy, 2 with bone marrow failure and 1 immune mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). COVID-19 diagnosis coincided with a new diagnosis of a haematological malignancy in four patients. 82% of patients were on systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) at time of COVID-19. Of hospitalised patients, 37% (19/51) died whilst all four outpatients recovered. Risk factors for severe disease or mortality were similar to Accepted Article other published cohorts. Raised CRP at diagnosis predicted an aggressive clinical course. The majority of patients recovered from COVID-19, despite receiving recent SACT. This suggests that SACT, where urgent, should be administered despite intercurrent CV19 infection, which should be managed according to standard pathway. Delay or modification of therapy should be considered on an individual basis. Long-term follow-up studies in larger patient cohorts are required to assess efficacy of treatment strategies employed during the pandemic. words
1f04e27ad51b6f85f0696b21c808852d78e1d5ca	Founder effects, together with access to unoccupied ecological niches, may allow rodent populations on isolated islands to evolve constellations of life-history traits that distinguish them from their mainland relatives, for example in body size, litter size, and longevity. In particular, low intrinsic mortality risks on islands with reduced predator numbers and not subject to harsh winter climates may in principle support the development of stocks with extended longevity. Conversely, the conditions under which laboratory rodents are typically bred are thought to select for genotypes that produce large, rapidly maturing races with high early reproductive rates but diminished longevity. To test these ideas, and to generate new mouse stocks suitable for genetic and molecular analysis of the processes that time life-history events, we have developed speci®c pathogen-free stocks from mice trapped from three distinct populations: the U.S. mainland (Idaho) and the tropical Paci®c islands Majuro and Pohnpei. Mice from all three locations were found to be shorter and lighter, to have smaller litters, and to have higher faecal corticosterone levels than mice of a genetically heterogeneous stock derived from four common laboratory inbred strains. Among the wild-derived stocks, mice from Pohnpei and Majuro were signi®cantly lighter and shorter than Idahoderived animals, even in populations kept from birth under identical housing conditions. Litter size and reproductive success rates did not differ signi®cantly among the three wild-derived stocks. Although further work will be needed to see if, as predicted, the wild-derived stocks differ from one another and from laboratory mice in longevity, these stocks provide useful tools for genetic dissection of factors that regulate body size and reproductive success.
1b7ae4d1a1a2417ccc31e8e6b3e90c48a6fac42f	Learning models from observations of a system is a powerful tool with many applications. In this paper, we consider learning Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC), with different methods such as frequency estimation or Laplace smoothing. While models learnt with such methods converge asymptotically towards the exact system, a more practical question in the realm of trusted machine learning is how accurate a model learnt with a limited time budget is. Existing approaches provide bounds on how close the model is to the original system, in terms of bounds on local (transition) probabilities, which has unclear implication on the global behavior. In this work, we provide global bounds on the error made by such a learning process, in terms of global behaviors formalized using temporal logic. More precisely, we propose a learning process ensuring a bound on the error in the probabilities of these properties. While such learning process cannot exist for the full LTL logic, we provide one ensuring a bound that is uniform over all the formulas of CTL. Further, given one timeto-failure property, we provide an improved learning algorithm. Interestingly, frequency estimation is sufficient for the latter, while Laplace smoothing is needed to ensure non-trivial uniform bounds for the full CTL logic.
4d121d838682efb448abc04b544b2f05db29491f	After infecting the Vero E6 cells by nasal/throat swabs collected from SARS patients, we studied the SARS-associated virus by electron microscopy and molecular biological technique. The results show that the diameter of newly isolated virus is about 50nm without envelope or 100 nm with envelope. The virus was proved to be a new coronavirus by RT-PCR and it responded positively to convalescent-phase serum specimen from SARS patients, which is the evidence that this new virus is etiologically linked to the outbreak of SARS. The morphogenesis and distribution of the virus are also discussed in this article.
52ef40cbfbd93f506eb4d57a15a7fac62a43e778	Chronic cigarette smoking induces pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by largely unknown mechanisms. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is known to function in the development of PAH. Losartan, a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is a well-known antihypertensive drug with a potential role in regulating angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a recently found regulator of RAS. To determine the effect of losartan on smoke-induced PAH and its possible mechanism, rats were daily exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months in the absence and in the presence of losartan. Elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), thickened wall of pulmonary arteries with apparent medial hypertrophy along with increased angiotensin II (Ang II) and decreased ACE2 levels were observed in smoke-exposed-only rats. Losartan administration ameliorated pulmonary vascular remodeling, inhibited the smoke-induced RVSP and Ang II elevation and partially reversed the ACE2 decrease in rat lungs. In cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from 3-and 6-month smoke-exposed rats, ACE2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats. Moreover, PASMCs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3month exposed or control rats, and cells grew even more rapidly in the presence of DX600, an ACE2 inhibitor. Consistent with the in vivo study, in vitro losartan pretreatment also inhibited cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cell proliferation and ACE2 reduction in rat PASMCs. The results suggest that losartan may be therapeutically useful in the chronic smoking-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH and ACE2 may be involved as part of its mechanism. Our study might provide insight into the development of new therapeutic interventions for PAH smokers.
59f08715895b7ba104ce0a47c3ec824b4ba07b00	The variant strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) severely threaten the pig industry worldwide and cause up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets. It is critically important and urgent to develop tools for detection of PEDV infection. In this study, we developed six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting N protein of PEDV and analyzed their applications on enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), western blot assay, and flow cytometry assay. The results demonstrated that all these six mAbs were IgG1 isotype and κ chain. Among these six mAbs, 3F12 recognizes a linear epitope (VAAVKDALKSLGI) while the other five mAbs recognize different conformational epitopes formed by a specific peptide fragment or the full length of N protein. The functional analysis showed that all these six mAbs were applicable to ELISA, western blot, IFA, and flow cytometry assay. In conclusion, we developed six mAbs against PEDV-N protein to facilitate the early detection of PEDV infection using ELISA, western blot, IFA, and flow cytometry.
de19b55cdf70410f671b34525ca450474d697195	Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is becoming widely adopted as a tool for structural characterization of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. Vitrification of the sample to obtain a dense distribution of particles within a single field of view remains a major bottleneck for the success of such experiments. Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective method to increase the density of frozenhydrated particles on grids with holey carbon support films. It relies on performing multiple rounds of sample application and blotting prior to plunge freezing in liquid ethane. We show that this approach is generally applicable and significantly increases particle density for a range of samples, such as small protein complexes, viruses and filamentous assemblies. The method is versatile, easy to implement, minimizes sample requirements and can enable characterization of samples that would otherwise resist structural studies using single particle cryoEM.

Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is becoming an increasingly important tool in structural biology (Nogales and Scheres, 2015; Cheng et al., 2015) . Due to recent advances in detector efficiency, microscope stability and image processing, the 3D structure of biomolecular complexes spanning a wide range of sizes, from haemoglobin to microtubules and intact viruses, can be reconstructed at (near-) atomic resolution (Bai et al., 2013; Brilot et al., 
0912f534628af93bc1d31f22d08f7836883f942a	Coronavirus disease of 2019 , which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is spreading rapidly the world over. The disease was declared "pandemic" by the World Health Organization. An approved therapy for patients with COVID-19 has yet to emerge; however, there are some medications used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, dexamethasone, protease inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity from COVID-19. Moreover, patients with chronic stable states and even otherwise healthy individuals might sustain acute cardiovascular problems due to COVID-19 infection. This article seeks to review the latest evidence with a view to explaining possible pharmacotherapies for the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 including acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism, as well as possible interactions between these medications and those currently administered (or under evaluation) in the treatment of COVID-19.

777d36ef204f5e963619a0efd3348a41b67b4dc4	Unlike for serotype II feline coronaviruses (FCoV II), the cellular receptor for serotype I FCoV (FCoV I), the most prevalent FCoV serotype, is unknown. To provide a platform for assessing the pattern by which FCoV I attaches to its host receptor(s), HEK293 cell lines that stably express the ectodomains of the spike (S) proteins derived from a FCoV I feline enteric coronavirus strain UU7 (FECV UU7) and a feline infectious peritonitis virus strain UU4 (FIPV UU4) were established. Using the recombinant S proteins as probes to perform S protein affinity histochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissues, although no tissue or enteric binding of FECV UU7 S protein was detected, it was found that by immunohistochemistry that the tissue distribution of FIPV UU4 S protein-bound cells correlated with that of FIPV antigenpositive cells and lesions associated with FIP and that the affinity binding of FIPV UU4 S protein on macrophages was not affected by enzymatic removal of host cell-surface sialic acid with neuraminidase. These findings suggest that a factor(s) other than sialic acid contribute(s) to the macrophage tropism of FIPV strain UU4. This approach allowed obtaining more information about both virus-host cell interactions and the biological characteristics of the unidentified cellular receptor for FCoV I.

Surveys regarding airborne isolation were distributed to 43 pediatric emergency departments at US children's hospitals with 26 responses. There was a median of 5 airborne isolation rooms, a median of 4 of those with negative pressure, and 61% without an ante-room. Capacity to manage pediatric patients infected with a highly pathogenic airborne-transmitted organism during an epidemic is limited.
9196f71e3ee80dfad57ea4f5bc8934f63f1e51ce	In a proper edge-coloring the edges of every color form a matching. A matching is induced if the end-vertices of its edges induce a matching. A strong edge-coloring is an edge-coloring in which the edges of every color form an induced matching. We consider intermediate types of edge-colorings, where some of the colors are allowed to form matchings, and the remaining form induced matchings. Our research is motivated by the conjecture proposed in a recent paper on S-packing edgecolorings (N. Gastineau and O. Togni, On S-packing edge-colorings of cubic graphs, Discrete Appl. Math. 259 (2019)). We prove that every graph with maximum degree 3 can be decomposed into one matching and at most 8 induced matchings, and two matchings and at most 5 induced matchings. We also show that if a graph is in class I, the number of induced matchings can be decreased by one, hence confirming the conjecture for this class of graphs.
9da50ca067b8c0dfdd49733683748a40f0419598	The COVID-19 epidemic which began in China last year has expanded worldwide. A 8 flexible SEIRD epidemiological model with time-dependent parameters is applied to modeling 9 the pandemic. The value of the effective reproduction ratio is varied to quantify the impact of 10 quarantines and social distancing on the number of infections and deaths, on their daily changes. 11 and on the maxima in these daily rates expected during the epidemic. The effect of changing Reff 12 is substantial. It ought to inform policy decisions around resource allocation, mitigation 13 strategies and their duration, and economic tradeoffs. The model can also calculate the impact of 14 changes in infectiousness or morbidity as the virus mutates, or the expected effects of a new 15 therapy or vaccine assumed to arrive at a future date. The paper concludes with a discussion of a 16 potential endemic end of COVID-19, which might involve times of about 100 years.
2aa4efa617a2ed9b62eecb177462d5609ca87aff	Explicit theory axioms are added by a saturation-based theorem prover as one of the techniques for supporting theory reasoning. While simple and effective, adding theory axioms can also pollute the search space with many irrelevant consequences. As a result, the prover often gets lost in parts of the search space where the chance to find a proof is low. In this paper, we describe a new strategy for controlling the amount of reasoning with explicit theory axioms. The strategy refines a recently proposed two-layer-queue clause selection and combines it with a heuristic measure of the amount of theory reasoning in the derivation of a clause. We implemented the new strategy in the automatic theorem prover Vampire and present an evaluation showing that our work dramatically improves the state-of-the-art clause-selection strategy in the presence of theory axioms.
de3ae406718555594e22c09baee48904a9402215	Traditional cultivation approaches in microbiology are labor-intensive, low-throughput, and yield biased sampling of environmental microbes due to ecological and evolutionary factors. New strategies are needed for ample representation of rare taxa and slow-growers that are often outcompeted by fast-growers in cultivation experiments. Here we describe a microfluidic platform that anaerobically isolates and cultivates microbial cells in millions of picoliter droplets and automatically sorts them based on colony density to enhance slow-growing organisms. We applied our strategy to a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) donor stool using multiple growth media, and found significant increase in taxonomic richness and larger representation of rare and clinically relevant taxa among droplet-grown cells compared to conventional plates. Furthermore, screening the FMT donor stool for antibiotic resistance revealed 21 populations that evaded detection in plate-based assessment of antibiotic resistance. Our method improves cultivation-based surveys of diverse microbiomes to gain deeper insights into microbial functioning and lifestyles. Watterson et al. eLife 2020;9:e56998.
6229de5da2f5e1fe77b7d702feabc57f70bef1b4	Spongiform degeneration is characterized by vacuolation in nervous tissue accompanied by neuronal death and gliosis. Although spongiform degeneration is a hallmark of prion diseases, this pathology is also present in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and Canavan's spongiform leukodystrophy. The shared outcome of spongiform degeneration in these diverse diseases suggests that common cellular mechanisms must underlie the processes of spongiform change and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues reveals increased ubiquitin immunoreactivity in and around areas of spongiform change, suggesting the involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction in the pathogenesis of spongiform neurodegeneration. The link between aberrant ubiquitination and spongiform neurodegeneration has been strengthened by the discovery that a null mutation in the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase mahogunin ring finger-1 (Mgrn1) causes an autosomal recessively inherited form of spongiform neurodegeneration in animals. Recent studies have begun to suggest that abnormal ubiquitination may alter intracellular signaling and cell functions via proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent mechanisms, leading to spongiform degeneration and neuronal cell death. Further elucidation of the pathogenic pathways involved in spongiform neurodegeneration should facilitate the development of novel rational therapies for treating prion diseases, HIV infection, and other spongiform degenerative disorders.
01a52991d1f987c1777097fc092898b0c1340b5f	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the 19 COVID-19, is spreading globally and has infected more than 3 million people. It has been 20 discovered that SARS-CoV-2 initiates the entry into cells by binding to human angiotensin-21 converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike 22 glycoprotein. Hence, drugs that can interfere the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 potentially 23 can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells. Here, based on the N-terminal helix α1 of 24 human ACE2, we designed nine short peptides that have potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding. 25 Molecular dynamics simulations of peptides in the their free and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-bound forms 26 allow us to identify fragments that are stable in water and have strong binding affinity to the SARS-27 CoV-2 spike proteins. The important interactions between peptides and RBD are highlighted to 28 provide guidance for the design of peptidomimetics against the SARS-CoV-2. 29 30

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries impose restrictions to inhibit spreading of infection. Isolation and limiting interpersonal contacts are particularly recommended actions. Adhering to the rule of isolation may involve restrictions in freedom during daily activities, such as shopping. The aim of the study was to develop a scale of in-store pandemic behavior. The whole process involved 3 stages: qualitative inquiry, scale purification and scale validation, which were based on 3 studies: 1 qualitative (20 in-depth interviews) 2 two quantitative (373 and 584 respondents, respectively), and allowed to identify 8 factors. Following, a theoretical model was created to investigate the impact of in-store infection threat on identified variables. All identified factors significantly correlated with the in-store infection threat which reiterates the importance of providing information revealing the true scale of the pandemic and not leaving space for individuals to create subjective probability judgments. The developed scale can help counteract disinformation and assess consumer behavior compliance and understanding of the official recommendations imposed by governments, enabling more efficient educational efforts.

d174c675d8fbd6a5407aacb3b18cec1353a5cca5	In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR model is proposed, denoted by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R 0 is derived. When R 0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R 0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.
da2bb5d1608eb75c739436e268af8310bd965e74	Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is the severe form of hepatitis E virus infection. Virus sequence analyses from severe cases have shown presence of unique and highly conserved mutations in the helicase domain of genotype 1, 3 and 4 viruses. We evaluated role of two amino acid replacements (L1110F) and (V1120I); found to be frequent in genotype 1 FHF-E viruses from India. Three mutant helicase proteins (two with single point mutations and one with dual mutations) were expressed in Escherichia coli and evaluated for their ATPase and RNA unwinding activities. Both L1110F and V1120I helicase mutants showed marginal decrease in ATPase activity, while L1110F/V1120I dual mutant showed normal ATPase activity. All three mutants proteins showed RNA unwinding activities comparable to wild type protein. Corresponding mutations were made in the helicase domain of HEV RLuc replicon and replication efficiencies were tested in the S10-3 (Huh 7) cells. The mutant replicon V1120I showed lower replication as compared to L1110F and L1110F/V1120I mutants. However, all three replicon mutants showed lower replication efficiencies as compared to the wild type replicon. Walker A and Walker B motif mutant HEV replicons were unable to replicate indicating essential role of the virus encoded helicase domain during HEV replication. FHF-E associated helicase mutations resulted in only marginal decrease in the virus replication suggesting alternate function/s of the helicase protein. Mutations in the helicase domain of FHF-E viruses may be responsible for changing virus or host-virus protein-protein interactions, causing alterations in the host responses, eventually leading to more severe disease manifestations.
30f527ca58ab6bff727209999d7eeaabd5dd51fc	The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) have been the subject of intense interest since their discovery in the early 1990s. Major research programs have been directed to the screening and/or design of JNK-selective inhibitors and testing their potential as drugs. We begin this review by considering the first commercially-available JNK ATP-competitive inhibitor, SP600125. We focus on recent studies that have evaluated the actions of SP600125 in lung, brain, kidney and liver following exposure to a range of stress insults including ischemia/reperfusion. In many but not all cases, SP600125 administration has proved beneficial. JNK activation can also follow infection, and we next consider recent examples that demonstrate the benefits of SP600125 administration in viral infection. Additional ATP-competitive JNK inhibitors have now been described following high throughput screening of small molecule libraries, but information on their use in biological systems remains limited and thus these inhibitors will require further evaluation. Peptide substrate-competitive ATP-non-competitive inhibitors of JNK have also now been described, and we discuss the recent advances in the use of JNK inhibitory peptides in the treatment of neuronal death, diabetes and viral infection. We conclude by raising a number of questions that should be considered in the quest for JNK-specific inhibitors.

9482e5881613ae262f54437bc845f8e5c75ef365	To determine whether a protective immune response could be elicited by oral delivery of a recombinant live bacterial vaccine, Helicobacter pylori urease subunit B (UreB) was expressed for extracellular expression in food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis. The UreB-producing strains were then administered orally to mice, and the immune response to UreB was examined. Orally vaccinated mice produced a significant UreB-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response. Specific anti-UreB IgA responses could be detected in the feces of mice immunized with the secreting lactococcal strain. Mice vaccinated orally were significantly protected against gastric Helicobacter infection following a challenge with H. pylori strain SS1. In conclusion, mucosal vaccination with L. lactis expressing UreB produced serum IgG and UreB-specific fecal IgA, and prevented gastric infection with H. pylori.
edf299be9be6a5616274c1c68448b880758b52f8	Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a major emerging zoonotic infectious disease. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against 2 MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca 2+ ) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca 2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca 2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudoparticles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca 2+ . Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca 2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca 2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca 2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca 2+ , as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca 2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca 2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.
3878a40e00d4ea40b7bbf424fab3676d2e2a1ca4	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of human 15 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The virus 16 rapidly spread globally, resulting in a public-health crisis including more than one million cases 17 and tens of thousands of deaths. Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of 18 commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 19 infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit 20 polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV 21 nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins 22 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established 23 RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established 24 a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-25 sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we 26 developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in 27 the same FFPE section. These reagents and assays will accelerate COVID-19 pathogenesis 28 studies in humans and in COVID-19 animal models. 29 Liu et al. SARS-CoV-2 detection in FFPE specimens 3

4d33f8a7d2eaeefadb48948eeef11341f8d66dd0	Impression curve is a widely used method in urban and landscape design to assess visual diversity of the space. In these studies, the method is applied for game level design. The goal of conducted research was the analysis of space perception in successive design phases related to the process of game environment formation. Next steps of the design process define the space burdened with more and more information. It aims to evaluate if initial assumptions, made by a designer at the beginning of the designing process, are maintained with the increase in the number of details and the content of locations. These studies are also a background for research in automation of visual diversity assessment. This, in turn, is related to making a player focused and interested during a gameplay, by the means of space defining an action scene. By applying a method from domain of urban planning and architecture in humancomputer interaction (HCI) studies related to virtual space, we show that both -defining the surroundings and its impact on recipient -are subject to the same rules in either case.
6d3dc29f877a0f54aa62315be135f13998a2d223	A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 suffers from progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. These patients present with progressive hyperinflammation governed by proinflammatory cytokines. An interdisciplinary COVID-19 work flow was established to detect patients with imminent or full blown hyperinflammation. Using a newly developed COVID-19 Inflammation Score (CIS), patients were prospectively stratified for targeted inhibition of cytokine signalling by the Janus Kinase 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux). Patients were treated with efficacy/toxicity guided step up dosing up to 14 days. Retrospective analysis of CIS reduction and clinical outcome was performed. Out of 105 patients treated between March 30th and April 15th , 2020, 14 patients with a CIS ≥ 10 out of 16 points received Rux over a median of 9 days with a median cumulative dose of 135 mg. A total of 12/14 patients achieved significant reduction of CIS by ≥25% on day 7 with sustained clinical improvement in 11/14 patients without short term red flag warnings of Ruxinduced toxicity. Rux treatment for COVID-19 in patients with hyperinflammation is shown to be safe with signals of efficacy in this pilot case series for CRS-intervention to prevent or overcome multiorgan failure. A multicenter phase-II clinical trial has been initiated (NCT04338958).
26e08ced295167f38992debd4d79a410624d6485	Waterborne enteric viruses are an emerging cause of disease outbreaks and represent a major threat to 23 global public health. Enteric viruses may originate from human wastewater and can undergo rapid 24 transport through aquatic environments with minimal decay. Surveillance and source apportionment of 25 enteric viruses in environmental waters is therefore essential for accurate risk management. However, 26 individual monitoring of the >100 enteric viral strains that have been identified as aquatic contaminants is 27 unfeasible. Instead, viral indicators are often used for quantitative assessments of wastewater 28 contamination, viral decay and transport in water. An ideal indicator for tracking wastewater 29 contamination should be (i) easy to detect and quantify, (ii) source-specific, (iii) resistant to wastewater 30 treatment processes, and (iv) persistent in the aquatic environment, with similar behaviour to viral 31 pathogens. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of 127 peer-reviewed publications, to critically 32 evaluate the effectiveness of several viral indicators of wastewater pollution, including common enteric 33 viruses (mastadenoviruses, polyomaviruses, and Aichi viruses), the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), and 34 gut-associated bacteriophages (Type II/III FRNA phages and phages infecting human Bacteroides species, 35 including crAssphage). Our analysis suggests that overall, human mastadenoviruses have the greatest 36 potential to indicate contamination by domestic wastewater due to their easy detection, culturability, and 37 high prevalence in wastewater and in the polluted environment. Aichi virus, crAssphage and PMMoV are 38 also widely detected in wastewater and in the environment, and may be used as molecular markers for 39 human-derived contamination. We conclude that viral indicators are suitable for the long-term monitoring 40 of viral contamination in freshwater and marine environments and that these should be implemented 41 within monitoring programmes to provide a holistic assessment of microbiological water quality and 42 wastewater-based epidemiology, improve current risk management strategies and protect global human 43 health. 44 45

Different extraction methods were also tested for their effects on the bioactivities of the medicinal plants. : Eight plants, namely Herba Polygonis Hydropiperis (Laliaocao), Folium Murraya Koenigii (Jialiye), Rhizoma Arachis Hypogea (Huashenggen), Herba Houttuyniae (Yuxingcao), Epipremnum pinnatum (Pashulong), Rhizoma Typhonium Flagelliforme (Laoshuyu), Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis (Houpo) and Rhizoma Imperatae (Baimaogen) were investigated for their potential antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Results: Extracts of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis had the strongest activities against M. Smegmatis, C. albicans, B. subtilis and S. aureus. Boiled extracts of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis, Folium Murraya Koenigii, Herba Polygonis Hydropiperis and Herba Houttuyniae demonstrated greater antioxidant activities than other tested medicinal plants. Conclusion: Among the eight tested medicinal plants, Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis showed the highest antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Different methods of extraction yield different spectra of bioactivities.
6b096c2cdb57c76f48242cb2917e6533d17eb6ee	This paper draws on Hayek's distinction between simple and complex phenomena to understand the nature of the challenge facing policymakers in responding to the new coronavirus pandemic. It shows that while government action is justifiable there may be few systemic mechanisms that enable policymakers to distinguish better from worse policy responses, or to make such distinctions in sufficient time. It then argues that this may be a more general characteristic of large-scale public policy making procedures and illustrates the importance of returning to a market-based political economy at the earliest convenience.

Immunosuppression can expose cancer patients to serious complications which can lead to delay in diagnosis and unnecessary hospitalizations that may adversely affect the prognosis of the disease. Patients who received chemotherapy or surgery within the 30 days before COVID-19 pandemic have more risk of infection than the patients who had not undergone chemotherapy or surgery.
24a92066e02bd3c6969010638ae38e9690c50d74	Positive controls are essential for PCR reliability and are challenging to obtain for rare, exotic and/or emerging pathogens and pose biosafety risks if manufactured using infectious pathogens. Custom synthetic DNA inserts can be designed de novo in tandems of forward and reverse complement priming sequences to be inserted in circular plasmid vectors. To test this concept, artificial positive controls (APCs) for use in PCR were synthesized to contain primer sequences targeting four viruses (Barley yellow dwarf virus, Soilborne wheat mosaic virus, Triticum mosaic virus and Wheat streak mosaic virus) pathogenic to wheat and, as internal control, the plant mitochondrial nad5 gene. Thermodynamics and folding parameters of twenty-four APC inserts were assessed in silico. Two thermodynamically different APCs, designated optimal and sub-optimal, were cloned and tested using end point PCR. The optimal APC had a 100% amplification rate, while only 92% of virus-infected plant tissues, commonly used as reference positive controls, amplified. An array of APC priming sequences from different organisms and/or previously tested primers can be accommodated in a large and flexible number of positive control targets. APCs will streamline and standardize routine PCR, improve reliability and biosafety, and create opportunities for development and commercialization of new synthetic positive control sequences.
735c88a4c5b6d4ce37707bfb66a38a410443c8a3	Background: Up to date, there have been no studies to evaluate pilgrims' knowledge, attitude and practices regarding MERS-CoV during the annual Hajj pilgrimage in order to see whether there is a need for these aspects to be improved. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted with a convenience sampling. Participants were pilgrims, aged over 18, and able to speak Arabic or English. A self-administered structured questionnaire was distributed during Hajj season in Mecca. Descriptive and multiple linear regression analysis were used in data analysis. Results: Two hundred and fifty-seven participants completed the study, 80% of whom were female, and the median (IQR) age was 35 (24.5e43.5) years. Pilgrims had moderately correct knowledge and accurate attitudes about MERS-CoV with median scores of 5 (IQR 4e7) and 6 (IQR: 5e7) respectively. Educational level and employment status were significantly associated with knowledge whereas gender and age were significantly associated with attitude and practices respectively (P < 0.05). The correlation between knowledge, attitude and practices was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.207; P < 0.05). Better knowledge was found to be a predictor for positive practice. Conclusions: These findings will provide insight when designing future interventions to promote specific messages to enhance knowledge, change attitude and improve practice regarding MERS-CoV.

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. The main outcome was the risk of ICU admission in diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection while the second was the mortality risk in overall diabetic COVID-19 patients. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) as the effect measure with the related 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I 2 statistic. Results: Among 1382 patients (mean age 51.5 years, 798 males), DM resulted to be the second more frequent comorbidities. Diabetic patients resulted to have a significant increased risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.79, 95 % CI 1.85-4.22, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 46 %). In 471 patients (mean age 56.6 years, 294 males) analysed for the secondary outcome diabetic subjects resulted to be at higher mortality risk (OR 3.21, 95 % CI 1.82-5.64, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 16 %). Conclusions: Diabetic patients with COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of ICU admission and show an higher mortality risk.
0263ef539a1344a642b1f4ff11aee6bc6ca84a34	The 1st Workshop of the Canadian Society for Virology (CSV2016) was a Special Workshop of the 35th Annual Meeting for the American Society for Virology, held on 18 June 2016 on the beautiful Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, Virginia. The workshop provided a forum for discussion of recent advances in the field, in an informal setting conducive to interaction with colleagues. CSV2016 featured two internationally-renowned Canadian keynote speakers who discussed translational virology research; American Society for Virology President Grant McFadden (then from University of Florida, now relocated to Arizona State University) who presented his studies of oncolytic poxviruses, while Matthew Miller (McMaster University) reviewed the prospects for a universal influenza vaccine. The workshop also featured a variety of trainee oral and poster presentations, and a panel discussion on the topic of the future of the CSV and virus research in Canada.
eeed5b1b33de4419273146c9f5466672e97a7bb5	Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug in the class of nucleotide analogs, has been particularly tailored for treatment of coronavirus infections. However, to which extent RDV is able to modify various types of membrane ion currents remains largely uncertain. In this study, we hence intended to explore the possible perturbations of RDV on ionic currents endogenous in pituitary GH 3 cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes. The whole-cell current recordings of ours disclosed that upon membrane depolarization in GH 3 cells the exposure to RDV concentration-dependently depressed the peak or late components of I K(DR) elicitation with effective IC 50 values of 10.1 or 2.8 mM, respectively; meanwhile, the value of dissociation constant of RDV-induced blockage of I K(DR) on the basis of the first-order reaction was yielded to be 3.04 mM. Upon the existence of RDV, the steady-state inactivation curve of I K(DR) was established in the RDV presence; moreover, the recovery became slowed. However, RDV-induced blockage of I K(DR) failed to be overcome by further addition of either a,b-methylene ATP or cyclopentyl-1,3dipropylxanthine. The RDV addition also lessened the strength of M-type K + current with the IC 50 value of 2.5 mM. The magnitude of voltage hysteresis of I K(M) elicited by longlasting triangular ramp pulse was diminished by adding RDV. Membrane electroporationinduced current in response to large hyperpolarization was enhanced, with an EC 50 value of 5.8 mM. Likewise, in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, adding RDV declined I K(DR) amplitude concomitantly with the raised rate of current inactivation applied by step depolarization. Therefore, in terms of the RDV molecule, there appears to be an unintended activity of the prodrug on ion channels. Its inhibition of both I K(DR) and I K(M) occurring in a non-genomic Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org fashion might provide additional but important mechanisms through which in vivo cellular functions are seriously perturbed.
bf0b4c7df943bf3f1c5f0118c0b7ea8cbd39e119	Proteins of the exocgtotic (secretory) pathway are initially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then translocated across and/or inserted into the membrane of the ER. During their anterograde transport with the bulk of the membrane flow along the exocytotic pathway, some proteins are selectively retained in various intracellular compartments, while others are sorted to different branches of the pathway. The signals or structural motifs that are involved in these selective targeting processes are being revealed and investigations into the mechanistic nature of these processes are actively underway.

3da77ad7d4a476e11948530879ef106622de8305	All eukaryotic positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses, (+)ssRNA, replicate their genome in association with membranes of host cells. The presence of a replicating virus frequently induces proliferation and rearrangement of the host membranes into various cytopathic structures, including invaginations, vesicles, spherules or membranous webs. Such structures are considered to be virus-induced organelles specialized in replication functions. Virtually all membranes are able to be rearranged to support replication. Thus, membranes from peroxisomes, endosomes, lysosomes, vacuoles, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are used for (+)ssRNA virus replication, but the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is by far the preferred organelle. The specific type of membrane system utilized in assembling the viral replication complex is strictly dependent on individual viruses and is likely to be genetically determined. The various molecular interactions that govern ER targeting of plant viruses highlight how viruses can exploit the diversity of interactions that occurs between proteins and membrane or lipid structures.

f99246cbbe6bd9471b85b9aa6d6c3ffe4a057957	Background: Adults with CHD are known to greatly benefit from a prompt access to continuous expert care. On the other hand, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has determined a dramatic worldwide reconfiguration of the healthcare systems, with rapid redeployment of resources towards this emergency. Italy was the first Western country affected by a large-scale spread of coronavirus disease 2019. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on in-hospital care of patients with CHD in an Italian tertiary centre. Methods and results: We retrospectively reviewed data on CHD hospital admissions in our centre since 1 March, 2020, when the adoption of a strict infection containment policy throughout the country resulted in limited access of patients to routine hospital care and resources reallocation to the care of infected patients. Comparison with data from the previous year was performed in order to identify any relevant differences attributable to the outbreak. Despite cancellation of all elective procedures, the overall number of urgent hospital admission remained stable throughout the period of study. Patients admitted during the pandemic had greater disease complexity (p = 0.001) with longer length of in-hospital stay (p = 0.01). No adverse events or positive swabs were reported among CHD patients who were admitted to hospital or medical personnel caring for these patients. Conclusion: Data from our early experience suggest that coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic did not impact significantly on the provision of urgent care to adult patients with CHD.
a13ec041578a2cca14b9970f5da50984d50cb24b	The objectives of the present investigation were to evaluate the pregnancy diagnosis by detection of either the allantochorion membrane (FMS) or amniotic sac (ASP) by per rectum palpation (PRP) during late embryonic or early fetal period on pregnancy loss (PRL) at reexamination, calving rates, and abnormalities in newborn calves. A controlled randomized blind design with 800 lactating dairy pregnant cows diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) between Days 35 and 57 of gestation from one dairy farm were included. The cows were randomly divided according to detection of allantochorion membrane (FMS group; n ¼ 264), detection of amniotic sac (ASP group; n ¼ 266), and TRUS (control [CON] group; n ¼ 270). TRUS was considered as the criterion standard method of comparison. The entire PRP was performed by one experienced veterinarian. Then, all the cows were reexamined only by TRUS between 2 and 4 weeks later by two independent veterinarians to assess PRL. The calving rate one (number of cows calved divided by the number of cows initially pregnant) and calving rate two (number of cows calved divided by the number of cows pregnant at reexamination) for each group was calculated. All abortions and stillborns were necropsied, and calves alive were followed for 5 days. The overall initial PRL (between initial pregnant cows and reexamination) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 7.4% (19/258), 8.8% (23/262), and 9.2% (24/260), respectively (P ¼ 0.75). The overall late PRL (between reexamination and calving) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 4.2% (9/213), 5.7% (12/209), and 4.2% (9/216), respectively (P ¼ 0.71). The calving rate one for FMS, ASP, and TRUS groups was 79.1% (204/258), 75.2% (197/262), and 79.6% (207/260), respectively (P ¼ 0.63). The calving rate two for the same groups was 85.4% (204/239), 82.4% (197/239), and 87.7% (207/236), respectively (P ¼ 0.27). The number of fetuses aborted late, premature, and mature dead from FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 6, 4, and 5, respectively (P ¼ 0.85), and no abnormalities at necropsy were detected.

dca4d35dd3164ec83b0691989eb49b7f343599ac	Through human history viruses have shown enormous epidemiological and pandemic potential as the occurrence and spread of viruses in pandemic dimensions poses a threat to the health and lives of seven billion people worldwide. Scientific evidence has associated harmful health effects to indoor air hazards recognizing the existence of a vital concern in public health sector. Thus the assessment of human exposure to biological aerosols and droplets indoor became an imperative requirement of investigation. Environmental bioburden assessment of viruses relies in both culture-dependent approaches that comprise classical methodologies, still prominent and vital in the field of modern biotechnology, and culture-independent approaches based on nucleic acid amplification techniques, which are considered the gold standard in clinical virology. The main factor influencing indoor microbiology is the human being and their activities. Indoor environments to be considered are those regularly occupied by humans: residences, offices, schools, industrial buildings, health care facilities, farming activities and other settings occupied all the time, or in which occupant density is high. It's well known that approximately 60% of total human respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are acquired indoor, since viruses have a rapid spread in the community and can be transmitted easily, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated environments, causing high morbidity and decline in quality of life and productivity. Studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza and parainfluenza virus, and E. Ribeiro (
49952f26e28224dcb6345f7bd9abcbc1b1dc32d8	Several novel astroviruses have been recently discovered in humans and in other animals. Here, we report results from our surveillance of astroviruses in human and rodent faecal samples in Hong Kong. Classical human astroviruses (n59) and a human MLB1 astrovirus were detected in human faecal samples (n5622). Novel astroviruses were detected from 1.6 % of the faecal samples of urban brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) (n5441), indicating the prevalence of astrovirus infection in rats might be much lower than that recently observed in bats. These rat astroviruses were phylogenetically related to recently discovered human astroviruses MLB1 and MLB2, suggesting that the MLB viruses and these novel rat astroviruses may share a common ancestor.

1219afa381eaf4f87881af215bbd767a080074cd	Climate change is anticipated to alter the production, use, release, and fate of environmental chemicals, likely leading to increased uncertainty in exposure and human health risk predictions. Exposure science provides a key connection between changes in climate and associated health outcomes. The theme of the 2015 Annual Meeting of the International Society of Exposure Science-Exposures in an Evolving Environment-brought this issue to the fore. By directing attention to questions that may affect society in profound ways, exposure scientists have an opportunity to conduct "consequential science"-doing science that matters, using our tools for the greater good and to answer key policy questions, and identifying causes leading to implementation of solutions. Understanding the implications of changing exposures on public health may be one of the most consequential areas of study in which exposure scientists could currently be engaged. In this paper, we use a series of case studies to identify exposure data gaps and research paths that will enable us to capture the information necessary for understanding climate change-related human exposures and consequent health impacts. We hope that paper will focus attention on under-developed areas of exposure science that will likely have broad implications for public health.

Because of the overlap of symptoms of Ebola virus disease and malaria, the care delivery of malaria is particularly sensitive to the indirect effects of the current Ebola-virus-disease epidemic. We therefore characterise malaria case management in the context of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic and document the effect of the Ebola-virusdisease epidemic on malaria case management.
d9bc72dcb21981faa5504ca0b2d670013d61dfdf	Cameron). Study objective: We compare the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of oral prednisolone/acetaminophen and oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination therapy in the treatment of acute goutlike arthritis in patients presenting to an emergency department (ED). Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled study in a university hospital emergency department (ED) in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Patients older than 17 years and presenting between February 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004, with a clinical diagnosis of goutlike arthritis were randomized to receive either oral prednisolone/acetaminophen or oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination therapy. Primary outcome measures were pain scores, time to resolution of symptoms and signs, and adverse effects. Secondary outcome measures were the need for additional acetaminophen and relapse rate. Results: There were 90 patients randomized: 46 patients to the indomethacin group and 44 patients to the prednisolone group. Baseline characteristics, including pain scores, were similar in the 2 groups. Both treatment groups had a similar decrease in pain score in the ED. The mean rate of decrease in pain score with activity for indomethacin was Ϫ1.7Ϯ1.6 (SD) mm per day and for prednisolone was Ϫ2.9Ϯ2.0 (SD) mm per day (mean difference 1.2 mm/day; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.0 mm/day; Pϭ.0026). Although these differences were statistically significant, at no time was the difference in mean pain score greater than 13 mm. Therefore, it is unclear whether these differences are clinically significant. The mean total dose of acetaminophen consumed by the prednisolone group was significantly more than in the indomethacin group (mean 10.3 g, range 1 to 21 g versus mean 6.4 g, range 1 to 21 g). Twenty-nine patients in the indomethacin group and 12 patients in the prednisolone group experienced adverse effects (PϽ.05). The commonest adverse effects in the indomethacin group were nausea, indigestion, epigastric pain, dizziness, and gastrointestinal bleeding (Nϭ5; 11%). None of the patients in the prednisolone group developed gastrointestinal bleeding. The relapse rate for both groups was similar. Conclusion: In the treatment of acute goutlike arthritis, oral prednisolone/acetaminophen combination is as effective as oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination in relieving pain but is associated with fewer adverse effects.

49e18956b9fad9e6114912a46567cdc6b9555c02	Viruses could manipulate cellular machinery to ensure their continuous survival and thus become parasites of living organisms. Delineation of sophisticated host responses upon virus infection is a challenging task. It lies in identifying the repertoire of host factors actively involved in the viral infectious cycle and characterizing host responses qualitatively and quantitatively during viral pathogenesis. Mass spectrometry based proteomics could be used to efficiently study pathogen-host interactions and virus-hijacked cellular signaling pathways. Moreover, direct host and viral responses upon infection could be further investigated by activity-based functional validation studies. These approaches involve drug inhibition of secretory pathway, immunofluorescence staining, dominant negative mutant of protein target, real-time PCR, small interfering siRNA-mediated knockdown, and molecular cloning studies. In this way, functional validation could gain novel insights into the high-content proteomic dataset in an unbiased and comprehensive way.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Graphical abstract J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide through person-to-person contact, causing a public health emergency of international concern. At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IκBα. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.
1ee191cacc6d1a57595b53dca3f178fe34050079	Overcrowding during the yearly Hajj mass gatherings is associated with increased risk of spreading infectious diseases, particularly respiratory diseases. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing face masks, social distancing) are known to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses from person to person and are therefore recommended to pilgrims by public health agencies. The implementation of effective public health policies and recommendations involves evaluating the adherence to and effectiveness of these measures in the specific context of the Hajj. This review summarizes the evidence related to the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in preventing the spread of respiratory infectious diseases during the Hajj. Overall, although hand hygiene compliance is high among pilgrims, face mask use and social distancing remain difficult challenges. Data about the effectiveness of these measures at the Hajj are limited, and results are contradictory, highlighting the need for future large-scale studies. ª

The increase in family isolation, unemployment, and economic stress has the potential to increase domestic violence. We document the pandemic's impact on police calls for service for domestic violence. The pandemic increased domestic violence calls by 7.5% during March through May of 2020, with effects concentrated during the first five weeks after social distancing began. The increase in reported domestic violence incidents began before official stay-at-home orders were mandated. It is not driven by any particular demographic group but does appear to be driven by households without a previous history of domestic violence. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 1 See, e.g.
d46207f53f15c61125164ff5c456d0d36a23039b	Ports are important infrastructures for economic growth and development. Among the most significant environmental aspects of ports that contribute to the issue of climate change are those due to carbon dioxide emissions generated by port activities. Given the importance of this topic, this paper gathers initiatives and methodologies that have been undertaken to calculate and reduce CO 2 emissions and climate change effects in ports. After studying these methodologies, their strengths and opportunities for further enhancement have been analyzed. The results show that, in recent years, several ports have started to calculate their carbon footprint and report it. However, in some of the cases, not all the sources of GHG gases that are occurring actually in ports are taken into account, such as emissions from waste treatment operations and employees' commuting. On other occasions, scopes are not defined following standard guidelines. Furthermore, each authority or operator uses its own method to calculate CO 2 emissions, which makes the comparison of results difficult. For these reasons, this paper suggests the need for creating a standardized tool to calculate carbon footprint in ports, which will make it possible to establish a benchmark and a potential comparison of results among ports.
0d4a062171d267be7be373b46e84437e8ba18e3a	Graphical Abstract Highlights d Virolectins detect and distinguish between closely related O-Ac-Sias in situ d O-Ac-sialoglycans occur in nature in a diversity not appreciated so far d O-Ac-Sias are differentially expressed in a species-, tissue-, and cell-specific fashion d There is extensive cell-to-cell variability in O-Ac-Sia expression in vivo and in vitro SUMMARY Sialic acids (Sias), 9-carbon-backbone sugars, are among the most complex and versatile molecules of life. As terminal residues of glycans on proteins and lipids, Sias are key elements of glycotopes of both cellular and microbial lectins and thus act as important molecular tags in cell recognition and signaling events. Their functions in such interactions can be regulated by post-synthetic modifications, the most common of which is differential Sia-O-acetylation (O-Ac-Sias). The biology of O-Ac-Sias remains mostly unexplored, largely because of limitations associated with their specific in situ detection. Here, we show that dualfunction hemagglutinin-esterase envelope proteins of nidoviruses distinguish between a variety of closely related O-Ac-Sias. By using soluble forms of hemagglutinin-esterases as lectins and sialate-O-acetylesterases, we demonstrate differential expression of distinct O-Ac-sialoglycan populations in an organ-, tissue-and cell-specific fashion. Our findings indicate that programmed Sia-O-acetylation/de-O-acetylation may be critical to key aspects of cell development, homeostasis, and/or function.

Specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were immunized with inactivated SARS coronavirus and their eggs were harvested at regular intervals. Yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) was extracted using the water dilution method, followed by further purification on a Sephadex G-75 column. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blot and neutralization test results showed that the IgY obtained was of a high purity and had a strong reactive activity with a neutralization titer of 1:640. Lyophilization and stability tests showed that lyophilized anti-SARS coronavirus IgY had promising physical properties, with no significant reduction in reactive activity and good thermal stability. All these data suggest that the anti-SARS coronavirus IgY could be a new useful biological product for specific antiviral therapy against SARS.
273c8c1f1c519a740508b46c302fd30fa4d856b8	The present study analyzed publishing data of scholarly journals which were published in 2018 by academic societies of science and technology in Korea to observe journal editing and publishing status. Methods: A total of 346 regional journals (59 natural science, 118 engineering, 44 agriculture, fisheries, and oceanography, and 125 medical and pharmacy) and 141 international journals (32 natural science, 43 engineering, 12 agriculture, fisheries, and oceanography, 54 medical and pharmacy) were included in this analysis, which applied the journal review by the Korea Federation of Science and Technology. Websites of the journals and the submitted publication data in 2019 were reviewed. Results: Except for a few journals, all of the journals were published by academic societies. Basic information of journals was well displayed by both offline and online. Most of the 346 regional journals were published in Korean language or mixed with English but 77 (22.3%), mostly medical, were in English. One-third (n = 104) journals published less than 40 articles while 9 published over 200, and 261 journals (75.4%) received less than 100 submissions in 2018. Most (n = 298, 86.1%) of them were enlisted in the Korean Citation Index (KCI). Editorial board members performed manuscript editing in 171 (49.4%) journals, and most of the journals paid < 50,000,000 won for publishing costs. Of 141 international journals, 138 (97.9%) were published in English and all of them published overseas submissions. Forty-one (29.1%) journals accepted < 20% of submissions but 58 (41.1%) accepted 100%. Of them, 124 (87.9%) were indexed in the KCI, 93 (66.0%) in the Web of Science, 120 in Scopus, and 62 in PubMed. Editorial board members in 38 (27.0%) journals took responsibility of manuscript editing. Publishing cost of 79 (56.0%) journals was < 50,000,000 won. Only 157 (32.2%) of total 487 journals, mostly medical, documented gendered innovation in their instruction to authors. Conclusion: Most of the Korean science and technology journals keep global standard of editing and publishing. Their offline and online visibility is acceptable but most regional journals are small and of low academic impact while international journals are globally indexed and acknowledged. Korean scholarly journals should invite more and better articles to keep quality publication.

We reviewed the evidence on cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 based on PubMed database. The searching strategy was (COVID* or coronavirus*) and (dermatol* or skin* or cutaneous*). The publication time was limited to 2019 onward. After independent review by two authors, 14 studies with 228 confirmed cases were included in the analysis. A total of 60 patients developed skin rashes, and the age ranged from 8 to 84. Exanthematous eruptions potentially related to COVID-19 infection were highly variable and heterogeneous. Skin lesions mainly appeared erythematous, urticarial, and vesicular (chicken pox-like or varicelliform). Petechiae rash, livedo reticularis, and reactivation of oral HSV-1 were also observed in single cases. Newly reported eruptions like vascular lesions and peculiar (perniosis-like) skin lesions caused concern among dermatologists. Exanthems were widely distributed and were primarily located on the trunk. Associated symptoms, latency time, treatment, and prognosis were also carefully summarized. This study reviewed the recently published COVID-19 studies with skin manifestations, which may pave the way for further research. coronavirus, COVID-19, cutaneous manifestations, review, skin
0aa08ea51d362b6b900052d22f615a2b46c1820f	Machine learning transparency calls for interpretable explanations of how inputs relate to predictions. Feature attribution is a way to analyze the impact of features on predictions. Feature interactions are the contextual dependence between features that jointly impact predictions. There are a number of methods that extract feature interactions in prediction models; however, the methods that assign attributions to interactions are either uninterpretable, model-specific, or non-axiomatic. We propose an interaction attribution and detection framework called Archipelago which addresses these problems and is also scalable in real-world settings. Our experiments on standard annotation labels indicate our approach provides significantly more interpretable explanations than comparable methods, which is important for analyzing the impact of interactions on predictions. We also provide accompanying visualizations of our approach that give new insights into deep neural networks. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Archipelago, which consists of an interaction attribution method, ArchAttribute, and a corresponding interaction detector, ArchDetect, to address the challenges of being interpretable, axiomatic, and scalable. Archipelago is named after its ability to provide explanations by isolating feature interactions, or feature "islands". The inputs to Archipelago are a black-box model f and data instance x , and its outputs are a set of interactions and individual features {I} as well as an attribution score φ(I) for each of the feature sets I. ArchAttribute satisfies attribution axioms by making relatively mild assumptions: a) disjointness of interaction sets, which is easily obtainable, and b) the availability of a generalized additive Preprint.

a40363fa5527e9b6dbf6930b247a4608027e7983	Aspirin is the oldest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and it sometimes causes asthma-like symptoms known as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), which can be serious. Unwanted effects of aspirin (aspirin intolerance) are also observed in patients with food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, a type I allergy disease, and aspirin-induced urticaria (AIU). However the target and the mechanism of the aspirin intolerance are still unknown. There is no animal or cellular model of AERD, because its pathophysiological mechanism is still unknown, but it is thought that inhibition of cyclooxygenase by causative agents leads to an increase of free arachidonic acid, which is metabolized into cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) that provoke airway smooth muscle constriction and asthma symptoms. As the bed-tobench approach, to confirm the clinical discussion in experimental cellular models, we have tried to develop a cellular model of AERD using activated RBL-2H3 cells, a rat mast cell like cell line. Indomethacin (another NSAID and also causes AERD), enhances in vitro cysLTs production by RBL-2H3 cells, while there is no induction of cysLTs production in the absence of inflammatory activation. Since this suggests that all inflammatory cells with activation of prostaglandin and cysLT metabolism should respond to NSAIDs, and then I have concluded that aspirin intolerance should be separated from subsequent bronchoconstriction. Evidence about the cellular mechanisms of NSAIDs may be employed for development of in vitro AERD models as the approach from bench-to-bed.
5f41d5e75451d4b86cdad75565becb316ce64fcd	Phase III platform trials are increasingly used to evaluate a sequence of treatments for a specific disease. Traditional approaches to structure such trials tend to focus on the sequential questions rather than the performance of the entire enterprise. We consider two-stage trials where an early evaluation is used to determine whether to continue with an individual study. To evaluate performance, we use the ratio of expected wins (RW), that is, the expected number of reported efficacious treatments using a two-stage approach compared to that using standard phase III trials. We approximate the test statistics during the course of a single trial using Brownian Motion and determine the optimal stage 1 time and type I error rate to maximize RW for fixed power. At times, a surrogate or intermediate endpoint may provide a quicker read on potential efficacy than use of the primary endpoint at stage 1. We generalize our approach to the surrogate endpoint setting and show improved performance, provided a good quality and powerful surrogate is available. We apply our methods to the design of a platform trial to evaluate treatments for COVID-19 disease. : medRxiv preprint P S (win) = θ 00 P S 0,0 (win) + θ 10 P S ∆ S ,0 (win) + θ 11 P S ∆ S ,∆ (win) while the expected sample size is E S (SS) = n t 1 + (1 − t 1 ) (θ 10 + θ 11 )Φ ∆ S √ t 1 − z α 1 + θ 00 α 1 .

e36bf83d8e36778452ded5ce3b89532d512696c9	The coronavirus spike glycoprotein (S) mediates both the attachment of virus to the host cell receptor and membrane fusion. We describe here the characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) having multiple S protein-related defects. The most remarkable of these was that the mutant, designated Albany 18 (Albl8), assembled virions devoid of the S glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature. Albl8 also failed to bring about syncytia formation in cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature. Virions of the mutant assembled at the permissive temperature were much more thermolabile than wild type. Moreover, mutant S protein that was incorporated into virions at the permissive temperature showed enhanced pH-dependent thermolability in its ability to bind to the MHV receptor. Albl8 was found to have a single point mutation in S resulting in a change of serine 287 to isoleucin¢, and it was shown by revertant analysis that this was the lesion responsible for the phenotype of the mutant.
45203a59571409cbe1d3c021f005948d906547cd	For the protection of people and society against harm and health threats -especially for the COVID-19 pandemic -a variety of different disciplines needs to be involved. The data collection of very basic and health-related data of individuals in today's highly mobile society does help to plan, protect, and identify next steps health authorities and governments can, shall, or need to plan for or even implement. Thus, every individual, every human, and every inhabitant of the world is the key player -very different to many past crises'. And since the individual is involved -all individuals -his/her (a) health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance, not overruling one aspect with another one or even prioritizing certain aspects. Privacy remains the key. Thus, the solution of the current pandemic's data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic and can be achieved in a democratic and very open, but still and especially privacy-protecting world. Therefore, the WeTrace approach and application as described in this paper utilizes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BTE) communication channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where asymmetric cryptography is being applied to allows for the deciphering of a message for that destination it had been intended for. Since literally every other potential participant only listens to random data, even a brute force attack will not succeed. WeTrace and its Open Source implementation is the only known approach so far, which ensures that any receiver of a message knows that this is for him/her, but does not know who the original sender was.
6c7990885e86d362e3ba8d96c217631f57fb2fd7	CoVID-19 is currently one of the biggest threats to mankind. To date, it is the reason for infections of over 35 lakhs and death of over 2 lakh human beings. We propose a procedure to detect CoVID-19 affected localities using a sewage mass testing and pooling mechanism which has gained ground in recent times. The proposed method named Sewage Pooling Algorithm tests wastewater samples from sewage systems to pinpoint the regions which are affected by maximum chances of the virus spread. The algorithm also uses a priority-based backtracking procedure to perform testing in sewage links depending on the probability of infection in the sub-areas. For places with very rare CoVID cases, we present a gradientbased search method to prune those areas. The proposed method has less human intervention and increases the effective tests/million people over current in-place methods.
8d662aaab4afda6c43bd35603ff87e190854de90	Inhalation of Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula causes "farmer's lung" disease, a classic example of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice challenged with S rectivirgula, and S rectivirgula induces MCP-1 secretion by alveolar macrophages. We tested the hypothesis that MCP-1 and its receptor CC chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) are essential to the development of experimental HP by treating mice with MCP-1 antibody and using CCR2 ؊/؊ mice. Administration of anti-MCP-1 did not change the response to intratracheally administered S rectivirgula. CCR2 ؊/؊ animals responded in a fashion similar to that of wild-type animals to intratracheally administered.S rectivirgula. To determine the influence of the MCP-1-CCR2 interaction in vitro, we transferred S rectivirgula-cultured spleen cells from S rectivirgulasensitized mice, to naïve recipients. Later, challenge of the recipients with intratracheal S rectivirgula and examination of both lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid characteristics were used to determine whether adoptive transfer had occurred. We found that cultured cells from CCR2 ؊/؊ animals were fully capable of adoptive transfer. We conclude that interaction of MCP-1 with CCR2 is not necessary for the development of pulmonary inflammation in response to intratracheally administered S rectivirgula or cells able to adoptively transfer experimental HP.

373c88a9a31b6a790779542b681ab2afe50ab86c	In this article, we present an approach to the ABZ 2020 case study, that differs from the ones usually presented at ABZ: Rather than using a (correct-by-construction) approach following a formal method, we use MISRA C for a low-level implementation instead. We strictly adhere to test-driven development for validation, and only afterwards apply model checking using CBMC for verification. In consequence, our realization of the ABZ case study can serve as a baseline reference for comparison, allowing to assess the benefit provided by the various formal modeling languages, methods and tools.
f665ba6827f5c4ded592aa8f88d5f18f971361a1	Epidemic surveillance is a fundamental part of public health practice. Addressing under-ascertainment of cases is relevant in most surveillance systems, especially in pandemics of new diseases with a large spectrum of clinical presentations as it may influence timings of policy implementation and public risk perception. From this perspective, this article presents and discusses early evidence on under-ascertainment of COVID-19 and its motifs, options for surveillance, and reflections around their importance to tailor public health measures. In the case of COVID-19, systematically addressing and estimating under-ascertainment of cases is essential to tailor timely public health measures, and communicating these findings is of the utmost importance for policy making and public perception.
b66e677361bbaaf41fdfd14851d9aa684d97df47	To mine Twitter to quantitatively analyze COVID-19 symptoms self-reported by users, compare symptom distributions against clinical studies, and create a symptom lexicon for the research community. We retrieved tweets using COVID-19-related keywords, and performed several layers of semi-automatic filtering to curate self-reports of positive-tested users. We extracted COVID-19-related symptoms mentioned by the users, mapped them to standard IDs, and compared the distributions with multiple studies conducted in clinical settings. We identified 203 positive-tested users who reported 932 symptoms using 598 unique expressions. The most frequently-reported symptoms were fever/pyrexia (65%), cough (56%), body aches/pain (40%), headache (35%), fatigue (35%), and dyspnea (34%) amongst users who reported at least 1 symptom. Mild symptoms, such as anosmia (26%) and ageusia (24%) were frequently reported on Twitter, but not in clinical studies. The spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms identified from Twitter may complement those identified in clinical settings.
7c5c3542337e3d2fceda7c257d4d79dcb7196583	Highlights  Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis of log return time series for S&P 500 index reveals a scale invariant structure for the fluctuations on both small-and large scale magnitudes.  Application of different statistical approaches to choose thresholds ound that the distribution of the weekly log-return data can be described by a combination of different distributions.  Uncertainty of the threshold values can be determined by the probability of changing the threshold on any given day.  We suggested a statistical model that describes registration frequency of extreme events under threshold uncertainty. Our model fits well the statistics of occurrence of the extreme values in the S&P 500 time series.  We defined an emergency scale of three levels based on the three regions of the threshold values corresponding to three peaks of the uncertainty curve. Abstract. An event is extreme if its magnitude exceeds the threshold. A choice of a threshold is subject to uncertainty caused by a method, the size of available data, a hypothesis on statistics, etc. We assess the degree of uncertainty by the Shannon's entropy calculated on the probability that the threshold changes at any given time. If the amount of data is not sufficient, an observer is in the state of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen who said "When you say hill, I could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley". If we have enough data, the uncertainty curve peaks at two values clearly separating the magnitudes of events into three emergency scales: subcritical, critical, and extreme. Our approach to defining the emergency scale is validated by 39 years of Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P500) historical data.
fd19cfef82dc2fd1ee48be9b10563d681610c000	δ-Crystallin is the major structural protein in avian eye lenses and is homologous to the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. This protein is structurally assembled as double dimers. Lys-315 is the only residue which is arranged symmetrically at the diagonal subunit interfaces to interact with each other. This study found that wild-type protein had both dimers and monomers present in 2-4 M urea whilst only monomers of the K315A mutant were observed under the same conditions, as judged by sedimentation velocity analysis. The assembly of monomeric K315A mutant was reversible in contrast to wild-type protein. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the dissociation of primary dimers is prior to the diagonal dimers in wild-type protein. These results suggest the critical role of Lys-315 in stabilization of the diagonal dimer structure. Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) denatured wild-type or K315A mutant protein did not fold into functional protein. However, the urea dissociated monomers of K315A mutant protein in GdmCl were reversible folding through a multiple steps mechanism as measured by tryptophan and ANS fluorescence. Two partly unfolded intermediates were detected in the pathway. Refolding of the intermediates resulted in a conformation with greater amounts of hydrophobic regions exposed which was prone to the formation of protein aggregates. The formation of aggregates was not prevented by the addition of α-crystallin. These results highlight that the conformational status of the monomers is critical for determining whether reversible oligomerization or aggregate formation occurs. responsible for the conversion of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate in the urea cycle. δ-Crystallin and ASL share about 70% amino acid sequence identity and function as homotetramers, with four identical multi-subunit active sites [1-6]. δ-Crystallin and ASL have similar X-ray crystal structures. Each monomer consists of three domains. The helices in domain 2 of each monomer associate to form a central helix bundle, comprising the core structure of the protein ( Fig 1A) [4,5,7-10]. The active sites of the enzyme are located in a cleft between three different monomers [4] . The quaternary structure of δ-crystallin consists of a double dimer. The contact surface between the two dimers is smaller than the interface within the primary dimer of the structure [11] . Hydrogen bonding, salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions are the major forces which stabilize the quaternary structure of the protein. In the presence of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), tetrameric δ-crystallin is unfolded via a multistep pathway involving subunit dissociation into a monomeric molten globule intermediate, followed by denaturation [12, 13] . The dimeric form is transiently detected during this unfolding/refolding process. These dimers are unstable and they are prone to self-associate into protein aggregates, and this process competes with the formation of native tetramers [8] . Hence, the assembly of two dimers acts as a kinetic barrier in the refolding pathway [14] . The proper assembly of double dimers is thus important for producing a stable δ-crystallin quaternary structure. The N-terminus of δ-crystallin has been identified as being critical for the proper assembly of the double dimers [8]. In the quaternary structure, the first 25 N-terminal amino acid residues protrude into the neighboring monomer and interact with a hydrophobic cavity. When this sequence of amino acids was deleted the protein became unstable and was prone to form protein aggregates. The salt bridge formed by residues of R302 and E330, located in the helix bundle at the dimer-dimer interface, is also important interaction for stabilization of the quaternary structure of δ-crystallin. When this interaction was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis, the exchange rate of subunits was dramatically accelerated [15] . The interactions of E327 with both K299 and R302 and the interaction of E267 with Y158 at the dimer interface were found to stabilize the quaternary structure of δ-crystallin in a cooperative manner. Mutations of the residues involved in both these interactions caused the majority of dimers to dissociate, whilst only partial dissociation was observed when these interactions were individually disrupted, as judged by sedimentation velocity experiments [11] . Inspection of the structure of δ-crystallin showed that the primary interactions between two symmetrically associated monomers in diagonal positions were provided by residues located at the top and bottom sides of the helical bundles ( Fig 1B) . K315 is one of the residues symmetrical located at this interface, interacting with the same residue in other monomers by hydrogen bonds (Fig 1C and 1D ). Substitution of this residue with leucine resulted in part dissociation of the quaternary structure. In contrast, the K315A mutant protein was relatively stable. This protein was unfolded into an intermediate with a stable conformation at 3 M urea [11] . This phenomenon was not observed for the K315L mutant protein, which was unfolded under the same conditions. The results lead to the hypothesis that the bulky and charged side-chain of K315 might affect the stability of the intermediate during the process of protein unfolding. When wild-type δ-crystallin was unfolded in GdmCl, the first transition for subunit dissociation resulted in a monomeric intermediate with a molten globule conformation [12, 13] . During the refolding of 5 M GdmCl denatured δ-crystallin a marked hysteresis was observed, suggesting that the quaternary structure of that inappropriate assembled species might be related to the conformation of the refolded monomers [14, 16] . The presence of stable intermediate during unfolding of K315A mutant protein in the presence of urea suggests that the interactions provided by this residue at the interfaces might provide an energy barrier for subunit dissociation.

0aedc185ca4490cb719b24a1f96eb7a700ae92de	Public health officials need tools to assist with anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We built a modeling tool to aid practicing public health officials with estimating healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impacts of population-wide social-distancing interventions. Methods. The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic's local spread. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile. Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at 6 to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity. Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy scenarios and updating of results as new data become available.
91b8cb1041fbbcc5774eb5d1634da179e3a78b61	The sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 prompted the establishment of a global scientific network subsuming most of the traditional rivalries in the competitive field of virology. Within months of the SARS outbreak, collaborative work revealed the identity of the disastrous pathogen as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, although the rapid identification of the agent represented an important breakthrough, our understanding of the deadly virus remains limited. Detailed biological knowledge is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures, diagnostic tests, vaccines and antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV. This article reviews the present state of molecular knowledge about SARS-CoV, from the aspects of comparative genomics, molecular biology of viral genes, evolution, and epidemiology, and describes the diagnostic tests and the anti-viral drugs derived so far based on the available molecular information.
6c32048d77cae44868e0ead284579289c2699b57	Symptom management and skilled communication with patients and families are essential clinical services in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While palliative care specialists have training in these skills, many front-line clinicians from other specialties do not. It is imperative that all clinicians responding to the COVID-19 crisis have access to clinical tools to support symptom management and difficult patient and family communication.
76c594a74df2d082259d51575335e120cfc32fd3	Bat species around the world have recently been recognized as major reservoirs of several zoonotic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Nipah virus and Hendra virus. In this study, consensus primer-based reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) and high-throughput sequencing were performed to investigate viruses in bat faecal samples collected at 11 natural bat habitat sites from July to December 2015 in Korea. Diverse coronaviruses were first detected in Korean bat faeces, including alphacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-like and MERS-CoV-like betacoronaviruses. In addition, we identified a novel bat rotavirus belonging to group H rotavirus which has only been described in human and pigs until now. Therefore, our results suggest the need for continuing surveillance and additional virological studies in domestic bat.

1dcbe701254463c23a49a37a43be95ce3b36f9bd	It has been 30 years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and technological development has drastically changed the future for those with disabilities. As healthcare evolves toward promoting telehealth and patient-centered care, leaders must embrace persons with disabilities and caregivers as valued partners in design and implementation, not as passive "end-users". We call for a new era of inclusive innovation, a term proposed in this publication to describe accessible technological design for all. The next 30 years of the ADA leading to year 2050, should reflect a new era of access, whereby digital health surmounts geographic, social, and economic barriers toward an inclusive virtual society.
db7b6440cfdfd2bbf71c22361d4ea606a16d4643	Involved in many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative, inflammatory and respiratory disorders, G-proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the most frequent targets of therapeutic drugs. It is time-consuming and expensive to determine whether a drug and a GPCR are to interact with each other in a cellular network purely by means of experimental techniques. Although some computational methods were developed in this regard based on the knowledge of the 3D (dimensional) structure of protein, unfortunately their usage is quite limited because the 3D structures for most GPCRs are still unknown. To overcome the situation, a sequence-based classifier, called ''iGPCR-drug'', was developed to predict the interactions between GPCRs and drugs in cellular networking. In the predictor, the drug compound is formulated by a 2D (dimensional) fingerprint via a 256D vector, GPCR by the PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) generated with the grey model theory, and the prediction engine is operated by the fuzzy K-nearest neighbour algorithm. Moreover, a user-friendly web-server for iGPCR-drug was established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iGPCR-Drug/. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated math equations presented in this paper just for its integrity. The overall success rate achieved by iGPCR-drug via the jackknife test was 85.5%, which is remarkably higher than the rate by the existing peer method developed in 2010 although no web server was ever established for it. It is anticipated that iGPCR-Drug may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the approach presented here can also be extended to study other drug -target interaction networks.
50cffcd69b9a397e6d4eebc02f6a34bbf1937b09	Based upon the scope of the original 5G ESSENCE research effort and by considering the related fundamental architecture, we develop a dedicated scenario for the implementation and demonstration of a setup for a 5G edge network acceleration in the context of a sport event, taking place in a stadium. Specifically, we demonstrate a combined 5G-based video production and video distribution scenario towards delivering benefits to both media producers/content providers and mobile operators, with those being able to offer enriched event experience to their subscribers. The production/distribution of locally generated content through the respective platform, coupled with value-added services and rich user context, enables secure, high-quality and resilient transmission in realtime, thus ensuring minimal latency. In the selected scenario, massive data traffic does not affect nor overload the backhaul connection as it is produced, processed and consumed just locally, aligned to the 5G 3GPP specifications. We also discuss details about the proposed services and functionalities of the use case, together with an approach for a potential projection to the market.
f243e05a2d51029218e0c313b20fa57c65104a62	The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) in Western Africa highlighted the need for anti-EBOV therapeutics. Clomiphene is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that blocks EBOV entry and infection in cells and significantly protects EBOV-challenged mice. As provided, clomiphene is, approximately, a 60:40 mixture of two stereoisomers, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene. The pharmacokinetic properties of the two isomers vary, but both accumulate in the eye and male reproductive tract, tissues in which EBOV can persist. Here we compared the ability of clomiphene and its isomers to inhibit EBOV using viral-like particle (VLP) entry and transcription/replication-competent VLP (trVLP) assays. Clomiphene and its isomers inhibited the entry and infection of VLPs and trVLPs with similar potencies. This was demonstrated with VLPs bearing the glycoproteins from three filoviruses (EBOV Mayinga, EBOV Makona, and Marburg virus) and in two cell lines (293T/17 and Vero E6). Visual problems have been noted in EBOV survivors, and viral RNA has been isolated from semen up to nine months post-infection. Since the clomiphene isomers accumulate in these affected tissues, clomiphene or one of its isomers warrants consideration as an anti-EBOV agent, for example, to potentially help ameliorate symptoms in EBOV survivors. 2 of 15 basis; these included the ZMapp cocktail of monoclonal antibodies [7, 8] , hyperimmune serum [9,10], and several low molecular weight anti-viral drugs [11] [12] [13] . Additional therapeutic antibodies [14] [15] [16] [17] have recently been described, and two novel low molecular weight viral RNA polymerase inhibitors are in development [18, 19] . A different approach has been to screen U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for anti-EBOV activity, with the goal of repurposing an approved drug, or combination of approved drugs, for use as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic in the advent of a future outbreak [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Clomiphene surfaced in two independent screens of FDA-approved drugs for anti-EBOV activity [20] [21] [22] ; it blocks EBOV entry and infection in tissue culture cells and provides up to 90% protection in the mouse model of EBOV disease [20, 21] . Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used to treat female infertility due to anovulation [25] [26] [27] . It was also proposed in 1991 as a drug to reverse impotence in men due to low testosterone levels [28] , and is currently used off-label for men with hypogonadism. We found, however, that clomiphene exerts its anti-EBOV activity in cell cultures irrespective of expression of the estrogen receptor alpha and/or beta subunits [20] . Instead, clomiphene likely exerts its anti-EBOV activity because it is a cationic amphiphilic drug [29] that accumulates in endolysosomes, the site of EBOV fusion and cytoplasmic entry [30] [31] [32] . Similar to other cationic amphiphilic drugs [29, 33] , clomiphene blocks a late step in the complex process by which the EBOV genome gains access to the host cell cytoplasm to initiate replication, most likely by blocking fusion between the EBOV and endolysosomal membranes [29] . Clomiphene citrate, the clinically-administered drug and the formulation tested to date for anti-EBOV activity, is a mixture of two diastereoisomers:~60% trans-clomiphene (enclomiphene) and 40% cis-clomiphene (zuclomiphene). Whereas enclomiphene exhibits high anti-estrogenic properties, zuclomiphene does not [34] [35] [36] . The two isomers also differ in other pharmacokinetic properties. For examples, zuclomiphene has a longer half-life in serum [37, 38] and persists in most tissues for longer periods of time than enclomiphene [39] . It could, therefore, be proposed that zuclomiphene is the major contributor to adverse side effects seen in individuals given clomiphene citrate and, conversely, that enclomiphene would impart fewer side effects [39, 40] . Due to these features, as well as its ability to raise testosterone levels, enclomiphene is currently in clinical development as a treatment for secondary hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) [41] . Because of the differing pharmacological features of enclomiphene and zuclomiphene and the ongoing clinical development of enclomiphene, we compared the effects of clomiphene and its isomers on EBOV entry and replication. We found that clomiphene, enclomiphene, zuclomiphene, and two of their primary metabolites (4-hydroxy-enclomiphene and 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene) block EBOV entry and replication to similar levels. Compared to clomiphene, enclomiphene, and zuclomiphene displayed similar dose profiles for blocking EBOV entry and replication, as tested in two cell types and with the glycoproteins from two isolates of EBOV as well as from a Marburg virus.

12979f88a49121ec28d1c032a1e6285b2e8c409d	On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. As the evolution and implications of the COVID-19 crisis are still unfolding, we posit that exploring the experiences and strategic responses of Asian countries may shed light on ways to combat COVID-19 for the rest of the world. In this paper, we first articulate the importance of resilience, strategic agility, and entrepreneurship in the context of the fight against COVID-19. Then, with the focus on China, South Korea, and Singapore, we discuss the impact COVID-19 is having on economies and businesses, governmental support for businesses and societies, and implications for global supply chain disruptions. We hope that the global health system will recover quickly, and that the world economy will be revitalized with the contributions and collaboration of science (including social science), industry, and governments.
e79e1ca39f35850879540728a90d38ffe36ddb04	It is more than 50 years since the lysosome was discovered. Since then its hydrolytic machinery, including proteases and other hydrolases, has been fairly well identified and characterized. Among these are the cysteine cathepsins, members of the family of papain-like cysteine proteases. They have unique reactive-site properties and an uneven tissue-specific expression pattern. In living organisms their activity is a delicate balance of expression, targeting, zymogen activation, inhibition by protein inhibitors and degradation. The specificity of their substrate binding sites, small-molecule inhibitor repertoire and crystal structures are providing new tools for research and development. Their unique reactive-site properties have made it possible to confine the targets simply by the use of appropriate reactive groups. The epoxysuccinyls still dominate the field, but now nitriles seem to be the most appropriate "warhead". The view of cysteine cathepsins as lysosomal proteases is changing as there is now clear evidence of their localization in other cellular compartments. Besides being involved in protein turnover, they build an important part of the endosomal antigen presentation. Together with the growing number of non-endosomal roles of cysteine cathepsins is growing also the knowledge of their involvement in diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. Finally, cysteine cathepsins are important regulators and signaling molecules of an unimaginable number of biological processes. The current challenge is to identify their endogenous substrates, in order to gain an insight into the mechanisms of substrate degradation and processing. In this review, some of the remarkable advances that have taken place in the past decade are presented. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis 50 years after the discovery of lysosome.
7a5cee03746b424ed66f72be1a343aaa3898f01d	Hoewel de incidentie van buiten het ziekenhuis opgelopen bacteriële meningitis afneemt, lijkt het aantal iatrogene gevallen te stijgen. 1 2 Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor ligt in de toename van chirurgische procedures onder regionale anesthesie (spinaal of epiduraal), uitgebreide neurochirurgische procedures en de toepassing van epidurale pijnstilling tijdens de partus. 1-4 De precieze incidentie van meningitis na spinale anesthesie of lumbaalpunctie blijft onduidelijk, 5-8 mogelijk door terughoudendheid om over deze ernstige complicatie te publiceren. 6 9 De frequentie van bacteriële meningitis na spinale anesthesie wordt geschat op 1 op 5000 tot 1 op 23.000 procedures. 5 6 8 In dit artikel beschrijven wij de ziektegeschiedenis van een 37-jarige man die na spinale anesthesie werd opgenomen op de intensivecareafdeling vanwege meningitis, waarbij Streptococcus salivarius als verwekker werd gevonden. ziektegeschiedenis Patiënt A, een 37-jarige man, werd op de afdeling Intensive Care van het Twenteborg Ziekenhuis opgenomen vanwege respiratoire insufficiëntie bij een status epilepticus. Zijn voorgeschiedenis vermeldde een polytrauma 10 jaar tevoren met gegeneraliseerd hersenoedeem en ischemische haarden in de linker hemisfeer met een hemiparese rechts als restverschijnsel. Posttraumatisch ontwikkelde zich epilep-sie, die goed medicamenteus te reguleren was. De verdere voorgeschiedenis was zonder bijzonderheden. Patiënt was niet immuungecompromitteerd. De patiënt had enkele weken vóór de intensivecareopname de chirurg bezocht vanwege een slecht genezend ulcus met abcesvorming aan digitus V van de linker voet, die werd behandeld met ciprofloxacine. Een week later volgde behandeling middels excisie en nettoyage onder spinale anesthesie. Uit het uitgeruimde abces werden Streptococcus milleri en Enterobacter cloacae gekweekt. Het postoperatieve beloop was gecompliceerd door progressieve wondinfectie, waarop was besloten tot een ruimere excisie. Deze werd 8 dagen na de eerste ingreep verricht, wederom onder spinale anesthesie. De dag hierop werd patiënt met spoed op de spoedeisendehulpafdeling binnengebracht, met een status epilepticus die niet reageerde op diazepam rectaal, en met respiratoire insufficiëntie. Heteroanamnestisch bleek dat hij zijn anti-epileptica niet had ingenomen vanwege nausea en malaise. Bij lichamelijk onderzoek was er een sterk gedaald bewustzijn, een lichaamstemperatuur van 41,5°C, een hartfrequentie van 140-200/min en een bloeddruk van 60/30 mmHg. Hij had trekkingen aan de linker lichaamshelft, een roodblauw gelaat en cyanotische extremiteiten. Tekenen van meningeale prikkeling werden niet aangetroffen. Bloedonderzoek toonde: leukocytengetal: 21,5 × 10 9 /l (referentiewaarde: 4,0-11,0 × 10 9 ); pH: 7,00 (7,35-7,45; er was dus metabole acidose); lactaat: 28,9 mmol/l (0,5-2,5); glucose: 13,0 mmol/l (4,0-11,1). Een liquorpunctie liet troebele liquor zien, met een leukocytenaantal van 13.730 × 10 6 /l (0,0-4,0 × 10 6 ), een eiwitconcentratie van 7111 mg/l (250-550) en een glucosewaarde van 0,2 mmol/l (3,3-4,5). In de gramkleuring werden geen bacteriën gezien. Onder de waarschijnlijkheidsdiagnose 'bacteriële meningitis' met septische shock, respiratoire insufficiëntie en casuïstische mededelingen Een 37-jarige man werd op de Intensive Care opgenomen wegens respiratoire insufficiëntie bij een status epilepticus, op basis van meningitis. Uit de liquor werd Streptococcus salivarius gekweekt. De bron van deze bacterie werd ondanks uitgebreide diagnostiek niet gevonden. Wel had patiënt recent spinale anesthesie ondergaan wegens een operatieve ingreep aan een teenulcus, waarbij andere bacteriën waren gekweekt. Patiënt overleed 2 weken na opname onder het beeld van multiorgaanfalen. Bacteriële meningitis na spinale anesthesie zou kunnen ontstaan door de verminderde bloed-hersenbarrière door de plotselinge verlaging van de liquordruk tijdens en na de punctie, of door introductie van bacteriën uit de haarfollikels of uit een hematoom, veroorzaakt door naald of introducer. Hygiënemaatregelen en een juiste techniek bij het uitvoeren van regionale anesthesie zijn van belang om verspreiding van bacteriën te voorkomen.
fdeaac09defec561e214a37d65df4b37b2de0c3c	Results: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that cTnI-ultra had the highest area under the curve (AUC) at 0.855, with a sensitivity of 67.3% and a specificity of 88.7% for the prediction of in-hospital mortality. Patients with higher troponin I-ultra (cTnI-ultra), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were associated with higher mortality, compared to those who lower levels. The multivariable cox regression indicated that age (hazard ratio (HR) 3.450, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.627-7.314, P = 0.001), coronary heart disease (HR 1.855, 95% CI 1.006-3.421; P = 0.048), elevated cTnI-ultra (HR 3.083, 95% CI 1.616-5.883, P = 0.001), elevated CK-MB (HR 2.907, 95% CI 1.233-6.854; P = 0.015), and elevated NT-proBNP (HR 5.776, 95% CI 2.272-14.682; P < 0.001) were associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: cTnI-ultra might be the best predictor of in-hospital mortality among myocardial injury biomarkers. Elevated cTnI-ultra, CK-MB, and NT-proBNP were independent biomarkers of the mortality in COVID-19 patients. high mortality rate [4, 5] . At present, COVID-19 lacks specific and effective drugs and vaccines. Therefore, it has great clinical significance to investigate risk factors of prognosis for COVID-19 patients. Recent studies revealed that the elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and elevated cardiac troponin I-ultra (cTnI-ultra), which are markers of myocardial injury, were significantly associated with severe disease and higher mortality [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Huang et al. reported that most patients with elevated cTnI-ultra required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [6] . In a similar single-center study, of the 138 patients, 36 (26.1%) were transferred to the ICU, and compared with patients who did not receive ICU care, their levels of

Characteristic images of lung CT had a clear change in COVID -19, Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and high-density linear combinations may indicate different pathological changes. Rapid lobular progression of GGO suggests the possibility of severe disease. 3. Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19: on the premise of no effective antiviral drugs, treatment is based on supportive and symptomatic therapy (albumin supplementation, supplement of potassium, supplement blood plasma, etc.) in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up SARS-CoV-2 . 4. According to severity, oxygenation index, body weight, age, underlying diseases, appropriate amount methylprednisolone application on severe/critical COVID-19 patients on demand, improved blood oxygen and reduced the utilization rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, case fatality rate and medical burden significantly. The most common indications for invasive mechanical ventilation should be strictly control in critical COVID-19 patients. 1.Accurate and timely identification of clinical features in severe risks, and early and appropriate intervention can block disease progression. 2.Appropriate dose of methylprednisolone can effectively avoid invasive mechanical ventilation and reduce case fatality rate in critical COVID-19 patients.
765b0ccd32a7951568f6eb1e88a27b2793f7ba80	Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by quotidian or double quotidian fever, a peri-febrile cutaneous eruption, polyarthritis, and multiorgan involvement. AOSD is a challenging disease with protean disease manifestations and rare, albeit potentially life-threatening, complications. In such cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment may prove life-saving. The purpose of this chapter is to review the diagnosis and management of challenging clinical situations in AOSD patients that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and to provide the readers with information that could aid their decision-making process.
95dbed40b9b6adbc57dcbae88e5bb4b8a3ad4929	Using a viral model of the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS), we show that intraspinal transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursor cells (hNPCs) results in sustained clinical recovery, although hNPCs were not detectable beyond day 8 posttransplantation. Improved motor skills were associated with a reduction in neuroinflammation, decreased demyelination, and enhanced remyelination. Evidence indicates that the reduced neuroinflammation is correlated with an increased number of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the spinal cords. Coculture of hNPCs with activated T cells resulted in reduced T cell proliferation and increased Treg numbers. The hNPCs acted, in part, through secretion of TGF-b1 and TGF-b2. These findings indicate that the transient presence of hNPCs transplanted in an animal model of MS has powerful immunomodulatory effects and mediates recovery. Further investigation of the restorative effects of hNPC transplantation may aid in the development of clinically relevant MS treatments.
146b3751a677fdabab53032e9cb45ade56a00e8b	Zusammenfassung Die Corona-Pandemie verändert aktuell zahlreiche Lebens-und Arbeitsbereiche in Deutschland. Im vorliegenden Beitrag werden erste Trends aus einer bundesweiten Online-Befragung mit 1867 Beschäftigten der Sozialen Arbeit zu den Auswirkungen der Einschränkungen auf die Beschäftigungssituation in der Sozialen Arbeit vorgestellt. Deutlich wird bereits jetzt: Neben Arbeitsverdichtungen nehmen die Beschäftigten veränderte Arbeitsbündnisse mit den Adressat*innen ebenso wie sich wandelnde professionelle Standards wahr -bei gleichzeitig mangelnder gesellschaftlicher Anerkennung. Die Folgen der Corona-Pandemie für die Soziale Arbeit sind zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt noch nicht absehbar, münden für die Mehrheit der Befragten aber in größeren Anforderungen an das eigene Handlungsfeld. Abstract The corona pandemic is currently transforming many areas of life and work in Germany. This article presents first results from a nationwide online survey. In this survey, 1867 employees of social work were asked about the consequences of restrictions on the employment situation in the area of social work. It is already clear: In addition to the intensification of work, employees perceive changes in the working bonds with their clients as well as changing professional standards, while, at the same time, witnessing a lack of social recognition. The consequences of the corona pandemic for social work are currently not foreseeable; yet the majority of the respondents expect the requirements within their own field of work to increase.
5b7753b6a659e6afa0a46fe171a372e682b07010	Background. The characteristics, determinants, and potential contribution to transmission of asymptomatic cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection have not been well described. Methods. A cohort of 47 households (493 individuals) in coastal Kenya was recruited and followed for a 26-week period spanning a complete RSV season. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were requested weekly, during the first 4 weeks, and twice weekly thereafter from all household members, regardless of illness status. The samples were screened for a range of respiratory viruses by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. Tests on 16 928 samples yielded 205 RSV infection episodes in 179 individuals (37.1%) from 40 different households. Eighty-six episodes (42.0%) were asymptomatic. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic RSV infection episodes were higher age, shorter duration of infection, bigger household size, lower peak viral load, absence of concurrent RSV infections within the household, infection by RSV group B, and no prior human rhinovirus infections. The propensity of RSV spread in households was dependent on symptom status and amount (duration and load) of virus shed. Conclusions. While asymptomatic RSV was less likely to spread, the high frequency of symptomless RSV infection episodes highlights a potentially important role of asymptomatic infections in the community transmission of RSV.

So werden in der Nacht im Schlaf körperliche und geistige Funktionen stabilisiert, die Proteinsynthese erhöht, Wachstumshormone freigesetzt und die Wundheilung positiv beeinflusst. Zudem konnte eine vermehrte mitotische Aktivität in Knochenmark, Haut und Leber beobachtet werden. Des Weiteren wird dem Schlaf auch ein positiver Einfluss auf das Immunsystem zugeschrieben. All diese Funktionen sind vor allem dem Non-REM-Schlaf und hier insbesondere dem Tiefschlaf zugesprochen worden [9, 12].

For RNA viruses, cellular or virusencoded RNA helicases play pivotal roles in viral life cycles by remodelling viral RNA structures and/or unwinding viral dsRNA produced during replication. However, no helicase or helicase-like activity has ever been found to associate with any NNSV-encoded proteins, and it is unknown whether the replication of NNSVs requires the participation of any viral or cellular helicase. Here, we show that despite of containing no conserved NTPase/helicase motifs, EBOV VP35 possesses the NTPase and helicase-like activities that can hydrolyse all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices in an NTP-dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, guanidine hydrochloride, an FDAapproved compound and inhibitor of certain viral helicases, inhibited the NTPase and helicase-like activities of VP35 as well as the replication/transcription of an EBOV minigenome replicon in cells, highlighting the importance of VP35 helicase-like activity during EBOV life cycle. Together, our findings provide the first demonstration of the NTPase/helicase-like activity encoded by EBOV, and would foster our understanding of EBOV and NNSVs.

716c2dd87b6cab56921724b7cdea183d90a282fc	In December 2019, the first patients in Wuhan, China were diagnosed with a primary atypical pneumonia, which showed to be unknown and contagious. Since then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform beyond the current public health dogma called "flatten-the-curve". A comprehensive literature review of publications on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, previous epidemics and related forecasting and containment strategies was conducted.
77ba146a186708d66b9743b410d04cd14b003dbf	Because many strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infect laboratory mice, no effective vaccine has yet been developed. An alternative approach to control MHV disease is the use of a host cell receptor-targeted ligand. To address the potential usefulness of this approach, a monoclonal antibody directed against the host cell receptor for the coronavirus MHV-A59 was administered to infant mice that were then challenged oronasally with 1()4 intracerebral infant mouse median lethal doses of MH\'-A59. Antibody treatment of virus-challenged mice resulted in lower proportions of mice with MHV-A59 in target organs and markedly reduced viral titers in these organs compared with mock-treated infected mice. Some antibody-treated infected mice survived for 7 days after viral challenge, whereas no mock-treated, infected mice survived beyond day 3 after viral inoculation. These results support a receptor-targeted approach to intervention in coronavirus disease. A receptor-targeted approach appears most likely te be effective in viral diseases in which the virus enters the body and first replicates in epithelial cells, such as those of the respiratory or intestinal tracts, which may be most accessible to treatment with receptor-blocking substances. An excellent model for analysis of such a receptor-targeted approach to prevention of viral disease is the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). MHV is the most prevalent virus infecting laboratory mouse colonies worldwide [6], and many MHV strains with tropisms for either respiratory or intestinal mucosal surfaces have been identified [7] . The receptor for the A59 strain of MHV (MHV-A59) has been identified as a 110-to 120-kDa glycoprotein [8, 9] . Virusoverlay protein blot assays (VOPBA) reveal that this glycoprotein is expressed on intestinal brush border membranes and hepatocyte membranes of MHV-susceptible BALB/c mice
3053529090a8974edc1ad695d3be4d407eef9674	Background: In rats, urine-borne male pheromones comprise organic volatile compounds and major urinary proteins (MUPs). A number of volatile pheromones have been reported, but no MUP pheromones have been identified in rat urine. We used sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF), nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) after in gel digestion of the proteins and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and showed that the levels of two MUPs, odorant-binding protein 3 (OBP3) (i.e. PGCL4) and MUP13 (i.e. PGCL1), in urine and their mRNAs in liver were higher in males than in females and were suppressed by orchidectomy and restored by testosterone treatment (T treatment). We then generated recombinant MUPs (rMUPs) and found that the sexual attractiveness of urine from castrated males to females significantly increased after the addition of either recombinant OBP3 (rOBP3) or recombinant MUP13 (rMUP13). Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we further examined neuronal activation in the brains of female rats after they sniffed rOBP3 or rMUP13. Both rOBP3 and rMUP13 activated the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), medial preoptic area (MPA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), medial amygdala (MeA), posteromedial cortical amygdala (PMCo) and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), which participate in the neural circuits responsible for pheromone-induced sexual behaviours. In particular, more c-Fos-immunopositive (c-Fos-ir) cells were observed in the posterior AOB than in the anterior AOB. Conclusions: The expression of OBP3 and MUP13 was male-biased and androgen-dependent. They attracted females and activated brain areas related to sexual behaviours in female rats, suggesting that both OBP3 and MUP13 are male pheromones in rats. Particularly, an OBP excreted into urine was exemplified to be a chemical signal.
aa6f5130d1109243bee530c972d97bb6653fd7e9	Background: The causes of acute febrile illness (AFI) in Latin America are diverse and their complexity increases as the proportion of fever due to malaria decreases, as malaria control measures and new pathogens emerge in the region. In this context, it is important to shed light on the gaps in the epidemiological characteristics and the geographic range for many AFI aetiologies. Objectives: To review studies on community-acquired fever aetiology other than malaria in Latin America, and to highlight knowledge gaps and challenges needing further investigation. Sources: PubMed from 2012 to April 2018. Content: We found 17 eligible studies describing 13 539 patients. The median number of pathogens tested per individual was 3.5 (range 2e17). A causative pathogen could be determined for 6661 (49.2%) individuals. The most frequently reported pathogen during the study periods was dengue virus (DENV) (14 studies), followed by chikungunya virus (nine studies) and Zika virus (seven studies). Among the studies reporting concurrent infections, 296 individuals (2.2%) were found to have co-infections. Inhospital mortality was reported in eight (47%) studies, ranging between 0% and 18%. Implications: DENV fever is the febrile illness most frequently reported, reflecting its importance, while chikungunya and zika viruses present increasing trends since their emergence in the region. Studies with systematic and harmonized approaches for detection of multiple pathogens are needed and would probably reveal a higher burden of neglected pathogens such as Rickettsia spp. and arenaviruses. The lack of point-of-care tests and harmonized approach limits the care provided by health professionals and the efficacy of surveillance for AFI in the region.
9d258f37f61f5e369b10e0281d0be9eb506d70e8	To characterize the antigenic epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of H1N1 influenza virus, a panel consisting of 84 clones of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated using the HA proteins from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine lysate and the seasonal influenza H1N1(A1) vaccines. Thirty-three (39%) of the 84 mAbs were found to be strain-specific, and 6 (7%) of the 84 mAbs were subtype-specific. Twenty (24%) of the 84 mAbs recognized the common HA epitopes shared by 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1), and A3 (H3N2) influenza viruses. Twenty-five of the 84 clones recognized the common HA epitopes shared by the 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1) and A3 (H3N2) human influenza viruses, and H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses. We found that of the 16 (19%) clones of the 84 mAbs panel that were cross-reactive with human respiratory pathogens, 15 were made using the HA of the seasonal A1 (H1N1) virus and 1 was made using the HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarray (TMA) showed that 4 of the 84 mAb clones cross-reacted with human tissue (brain and pancreas). Our results indicated that the influenza virus HA antigenic epitopes not only induce type-, subtype-, and strain-specific monoclonal antibodies against influenza A virus but also cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against human tissues. Further investigations of these cross-reactive (heterophilic) epitopes may significantly improve our understanding of viral antigenic variation, epidemics, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and adverse effects of influenza vaccines.
7d1c303ff244bbbb2204e534be50b5fbb2f0a077	Several attempts to control the dreadfulness of SARS-CoV-2 are still underway. Based on the 29 literature evidences we have speculated a prospective contemporary remedy, which was 30 categorized into Specificity, Remedy, and a Conveyor. In which, pros and cons were 31 discussed and inferred the possible alternatives. (a) Specificity: Implicit to express the ACE2 32 receptors in conveyor cells to deceive SARS-CoV-2 from prepone targets. (b) Remedy: As 33 depletion of pulmonary surfactants causes strong acute respiratory distress syndrome, we 34 propose an entity of a cost-effective artificial surfactant system as a remedy to pulmonary 35 complications. (c) Conveyor: We propose red blood cells (RBCs) as a conveyor with 36 embedded artificial surfactant and protruding ACE2 receptors for the target-specific delivery. 37 Overall we postulate focused insights by employing a combinational contemporary strategy 38 to steer towards a prospective direction on combating SARS-CoV-2. 39 
323c52cddef7a35732afdc41dac2a1aa6cb60f16	This investigation was aimed to compare the inference of antelope phylogenies resulting from the 16S rRNA, cytochrome-b (cyt-b) and d-loop segments of mitochondrial DNA using three different computational models including Bayesian (BA), maximum parsimony (MP) and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). The respective nucleotide sequences of three Oryx species (Oryx leucoryx, Oryx dammah and Oryx gazella) and an out-group (Addax nasomaculatus) were aligned and subjected to BA, MP and UPGMA models for comparing the topologies of respective phylogenetic trees. The 16S rRNA region possessed the highest frequency of conserved sequences (97.65%) followed by cyt-b (94.22%) and d-loop (87.29%). There were few transitions (2.35%) and none transversions in 16S rRNA as compared to cyt-b (5.61% transitions and 0.17% transversions) and d-loop (11.57% transitions and 1.14% transversions) while comparing the four taxa. All the three mitochondrial segments clearly differentiated the genus Addax from Oryx using the BA or UPGMA models. The topologies of all the gamma-corrected Bayesian trees were identical irrespective of the marker type. The UPGMA trees resulting from 16S rRNA and d-loop sequences were also identical (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx leucoryx) to Bayesian trees except that the UPGMA tree based on cyt-b showed a slightly different phylogeny (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx gazella) with a low bootstrap support. However, the MP model failed to differentiate the genus Addax from Oryx. These fi ndings demonstrate the effi ciency and robustness of BA and UPGMA methods for phylogenetic analysis of antelopes using mitochondrial markers.
97a192f85448348877f4fbc0f93510fbc3a16d2c	Modern compute architectures often consist of multiple CPU cores to achieve their performance, as physical properties put a limit on the execution speed of a single processor. This trend is also visible in the embedded and real-time domain, where programmers are forced to parallelize their software to keep deadlines. Additionally, embedded systems rely increasingly on modular applications, that can easily be adapted to different system loads and hardware configurations. To parallelize applications under these dynamic conditions, often dispatching frameworks like Threading Building Blocks (TBB) are used in the desktop and server segment. More recently, Embedded Multicore Building Blocks (EMB 2 ) was developed as a task-based programming solution designed with the constraints of embedded systems in mind. In this paper, we discuss how task-based programming fits such systems by analyzing scheduler implementation variants, with a focus on classic work-stealing and the libraries TBB and EMB 2 . Based on the state of the art we introduce a novel resource-trading concept that allows static memory allocation in a work-stealing runtime holding strict space and time bounds. We conduct benchmarks between an early prototype of the concept, TBB and EMB 2 , showing that resource-trading does not introduce additional runtime overheads, while unfortunately also not improving on execution time variances.
f55260d9ea1d5664f78ee89d427effe2f76a27fc	SMT-based model checkers, especially IC3-style ones, are currently the most effective techniques for verification of infinite state systems. They infer global inductive invariants via local reasoning about a single step of the transition relation of a system, while employing SMTbased procedures, such as interpolation, to mitigate the limitations of local reasoning and allow for better generalization. Unfortunately, these mitigations intertwine model checking with heuristics of the underlying SMT-solver, negatively affecting stability of model checking. In this paper, we propose to tackle the limitations of locality in a systematic manner. We introduce explicit global guidance into the local reasoning performed by IC3-style algorithms. To this end, we extend the SMT-IC3 paradigm with three novel rules, designed to mitigate fundamental sources of failure that stem from locality. We instantiate these rules for the theory of Linear Integer Arithmetic and implement them on top of Spacer solver in Z3. Our empirical results show that GSpacer, Spacer extended with global guidance, is significantly more effective than both Spacer and sole global reasoning, and, furthermore, is insensitive to interpolation.
b1f67bc0ea257e3e188942b8d3557d6aa167898d	• Remdesivir has been recently given an Emergency Use Authorization for inpatients use in severe COVID-19 in both adults and children. • While the first double-blind, randomized-controlled trial (DBRCT) found no significant benefit with remdesivir compared to placebo, preliminary reports from another DBRCT showed a significant faster recovery, without any difference in mortality. • Interestingly, a short 5-days course of remdesivir was found to have a similar efficacy to a long 10-days course with a lesser side effect. Abstract Remdesivir is a broad spectrum anti-viral drug that has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, in vitro and in vivo. In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as "Remdesivir" or 'GS-5734" AND "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2" and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality. Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials.
0e40f87b34c9f1b2626fb1d4c1d76178a7900a9c	The emergence of a novel strain of H1N1 influenza virus in Mexico in 2009, and its subsequent worldwide spread, has focused attention to the question of optimal deployment of mass vaccination campaigns. Here, we use three relatively simple models to address three issues of primary concern in the targeting of any vaccine. The advantages of such simple models are that the underlying assumptions and effects of individual parameters are relatively clear, and the impact of uncertainty in the parametrization can be readily assessed in the early stages of an outbreak. In particular, we examine whether targeting risk-groups, agegroups or spatial regions could be optimal in terms of reducing the predicted number of cases or severe effects; and how these targeted strategies vary as the epidemic progresses. We examine the conditions under which it is optimal to initially target vaccination towards those individuals within the population who are most at risk of severe effects of infection. Using age-structured mixing matrices, we show that targeting vaccination towards the more epidemiologically important age groups (5 -14 year olds and then 15-24 year olds) leads to the greatest reduction in the epidemic growth and hence reduces the total number of cases. Finally, we consider how spatially targeting the vaccine towards regions of country worst affected could provide an advantage. We discuss how all three of these priorities change as both the speed at which vaccination can be deployed and the start of the vaccination programme is varied.
86fc089cac3a5df23b1c0023cc9f964442e7919c	We investigate the transition probabilities for the "flavor" eigenstates in the twolevel quantum system, which is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with the parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry. Particularly, we concentrate on the so-called PT-broken phase, where two eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian turn out to be a complex conjugate pair. In this case, we find that the transition probabilities will be unbounded in the limit of infinite time t → +∞. After making a connection between the PT-broken phase and the neutral-meson system in particle physics, we observe that the infinite-time behavior of the transition probabilities can be attributed to the negative decay width of one eigenstate of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We also present some brief remarks on the situation at the so-called exceptional point, where both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with the joint parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry have recently attracted a lot of attention [1] and very interesting applications have been found for a number of physical systems in particle physics, nuclear physics, optics, electronics, and many others [2] . In the existing literature, the two-level system with PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [3, 4] has been extensively investigated, as a simple but instructive example, to explore and clarify all related conceptual issues [5] [6] [7] . However, it is worthwhile to mention that the transition amplitudes and probabilities between the "flavor" eigenstates have rarely been studied, except for some general discussion in Refs. [8, 9] . Since the phenomenon of "flavor" mixing is quite common in particle physics, such as flavor oscillations of massive neutrinos [10] and the neutral-meson system P 0 -P 0 [11] (e.g., , it is intriguing to consider the transitions among "flavor" eigenstates in the system with PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians [12, 13] . In our previous work [13], we calculated the transition probabilities for the "flavor" eigenstates in the scenario, where the PT symmetry is always preserved and two eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are real, which is known as the PT-symmetric phase. In the present work, we aim to extend the previous study in the PT-symmetric phase to the PT-broken phase. The primary motivation for such an extension is at least two-fold. First, by "flavor" eigenstates of a two-level quantum system with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H, we mean the complete set of basis vectors {|u β } (for β = a, b), in which the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian is given by H αβ ≡ u α |H|u β and the left vectors u α | ≡ |u α † and u β | ≡ |u β † (for α, β = a, b) have been defined as in conventional quantum mechanics. Therefore, the transition amplitudes in the following discussion will be referred to the projection of the time-evolved flavor eigenstates {|u α (t) } into their initial states {|u β }. However, whenever the transition amplitudes A αβ ≡ u β |u α (t) are calculated, we will clearly indicate the exact definition of the involved inner product as well as that of the left state vectors. As mentioned, for PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, the transition amplitudes A αβ and the corresponding probabilities P αβ ≡ |A αβ | 2 have been explicitly computed and extensively studied in Ref. [13] . Hence, it is a natural continuation to extend the investigation to the PT-broken phase. Second, in contrast to the PT-symmetric phase, where two eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are real, the PT-broken phase will be complicated by a complexconjugate pair of eigenvalues. As is well known, if PT symmetry is maintained, it is always possible to find a similarity transformation that converts a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into its Hermitian counterpart [5, 7, 13] . However, this is impossible for the PT-broken phase, rendering it rather different. Hence, in this particular case, the transition probabilities deserve a dedicated study. The remaining part of this work is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we present the general formalism for the investigation of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and summarize the main features of the PT-symmetric phase, the PT-broken phase, and the
778a0fd080fb4b2e27dfc13099c7eeabbb565f40	Hand hygiene is considered one of the most important infection control measures for preventing healthcare-associated infections. However, compliance rates with recommended hand hygiene practices in hospitals remain low. Previous literature on ways to improve hand hygiene practices has focused on the USA and Europe, whereas studies from developing countries are less common. In this study, we sought to identify common issues and potential strategies for improving hand hygiene practices in hospitals in China. We used a qualitative survey design based on in-depth interviews with 25 key hospital and public health staff in eight hospitals selected by the Chinese Ministry of Health. We found that hospital workers viewed hand hygiene as paramount to effective infection control and had adequate knowledge about proper hand hygiene practices. Despite these positive attitudes and adequate knowledge, critical challenges to improving rates of proper hand hygiene practices were identified. These included lack of needed resources, limited organisational authority of hospital infection control departments, and ineffective use of data monitoring and feedback to motivate improvements. Our study suggests that a pivotal issue for improving hand hygiene practice in China is providing infection control departments adequate attention, priority, and influence within the hospital, with a clear line of authority to senior management. Elevating the place of infection control on the hospital organisational chart and changing the paradigm of surveillance to continuous monitoring and effective data feedback are central to achieving improved hand hygiene practices and quality of care.

73e97c80da805cb7452f25adb5f946559b5aed18	In the present study, we fabricated a label-free avian influenza (AIV H5N1) detection biosensor composed of a multi-functional DNA 3 way-Junction (3 W J) on a hollow Au spike-like nanoparticle (hAuSN) using a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) method. To construct the multi-functional DNA (MF-DNA) as a bioprobe, the 3 W J was introduced. The proposed AIV detection bioprobe should contain three functionalities: target recognition, signal amplification, and connection to substrate. To achieve this goal, each piece of the DNA 3 W J was tailored to a hemagglutinin (HA) binding aptamer, FAM dye and thiol group, respectively. The assembly of each DNA 3 W J functional fragment was then confirmed by TBM-Native PAGE. Moreover, the hAuSN was immobilized on the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate for LSPR measurement. The DNA 3 W J was immobilized onto the hAuSN electrode through the thiol-group of DNA 3 W J. The fabricated DNA 3 W J/hAuSN heterolayer on the ITO substrate was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). LSPR experiments were conducted to confirm HA protein binding to the DNA 3 W J/ hAuSN -modified electrode. The proposed biosensor can detected the HA protein in PBS buffer (LOD: 1 pM) as well as in the diluted chicken serum (LOD: 1 pM). The present study details a label-free, simple fabrication method consisted of DNA 3 W J/ hAuSN heterolayer that uses easy-to-tailor elements to detect not only AIV but also various viruses detection platform easily.

1bef85a33a74c3d1765752da0e715fc3a46e00d8	Background: Dengue is endemic throughout Cambodia, a country faced with significant health and economic challenges. We undertook a clinical study at the National Paediatric Hospital in Phnom Penh to evaluate clinical diagnostic parameters for dengue and predictors of disease outcome. Methods: Between September 2011 and January 2013, all consecutive inpatients aged between 1 and 15 years and presenting with suspected dengue were enrolled. They were clinically assessed using both the 1997 and 2009 WHO dengue classifications. Specimens were collected upon admission and discharge and tested for dengue at Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. Results: A total of 701 patients were screened. Of these, 79 % were dengue-confirmed by laboratory testing, and 21 % tested dengue-negative. A positive tourniquet test, absence of upper respiratory symptoms, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver transaminases were independent predictors for laboratory-confirmed dengue among the children. The presence of several warning signs on hospital admission was associated with a concurrent laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe disease outcome. Conclusions: The presence of two or more warning signs was associated with a concurrent laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe dengue at hospital admission. Thus, a cumulative score combining simple clinical parameters and first-line laboratory findings could be used to accurately predict dengue virus infection in pediatric populations, optimizing triage in settings with limited laboratory resources.

40897ed0606a6a0e1eba23f7690270abdfc297ff	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding both the immunological processes providing specific immunity and potential immunopathology underlying the pathogenesis of this disease may provide valuable insights for potential therapeutic interventions. Here, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses in patients with different clinical courses. Compared to individuals with a mild clinical presentation, CD4+ T cell responses were qualitatively impaired in critically ill patients. Strikingly, however, in these patients the specific IgG antibody response was remarkably strong. The observed disparate T and B cell responses could be indicative of a deregulated immune response in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

221aab6d1b17b44bcfe5673d55d95f8a6d5d3b90	COVID-19 pandemia is a major concern for patients and healthcare systems. The fear of infection by patients with concomitant rheumatic diseases (either adult or children) and connective tissue diseases is arising worldwide, because of their immunological background and immunological therapies. Analysing the basic biology of single diseases, the data suggest that there is an "immunological umbrella" that seems to protect against the infection, through IFN type 1 and NK cell function. To date, reports from China, United States and Europe did not reveal an higher risk of infection, either for rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis nor for lupus erythematosus. Antimalarials, anti-IL6-Anti-IL6 receptor, anti-IL1, anti-GM-CSF receptor and JAK1/2/3 inhibitors, are under investigation in COVID-dedicated clinical trials to control the inflammation raised by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial reports on the occurrence of autoimmune phenomena in the convalescence phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that the immunological consequences of the infection need to be strictly understood. Reporting of the study conforms to broad EQUATOR guidelines (Simera et al January 2010 issue of EJCI).
ea7a7df6e99e33361647f3e4c98e330188edd2e6	The global population of adults over 65 years of age is growing rapidly and is expected to double by 2050. Countries will face substantial health, economic and social burden deriving from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as influenza, pneumonia and herpes zoster in older adults. It will be essential that countries utilize several public health strategies, including immunization. Understanding the different approaches countries have taken on adult immunization could help provide future learnings and technical support for adult vaccines within life-course immunization strategies. In this study, we describe the priorities and approaches that underlie adult immunization decision-making and implementation processes in 32 high-and-middle-income countries and two territories (''34 countries") who recommend adult vaccines in their national schedule. We conducted an archetype analysis based on a subset of two dozen indicators abstracted from a larger database. The analysis was based on a mixed-methods study, including results from 120 key informant interviews in six countries and a landscape review of secondary data from 34 countries. We found four distinct archetypes: disease prevention-focused; health security-focused; evolving adult focus; and, child-focused and cost-sensitive. The highest performing countries belonged to the disease prevention-focused and health security archetypes, although there was a range of performance within each archetype. Considering common barriers and facilitators of decision-making and implementation of adult vaccines within a primary archetype could help provide a framework for strategies to support countries with similar needs and approaches. It can also help in developing context-specific policies and guidance, including for countries prioritizing adult immunization programs in light of COVID-19. Further research may be beneficial to further refine archetypes and expand the understanding of what influences success within them. This can help advance policies and action that will improve vaccine access for older adults and build a stronger appreciation of the value of immunization amongst a variety of stakeholders.
c18d86a69a8d8965e3b787d74eb16eb941d988b5	In the fight against COVID-19, frontline health workers have been vital to keeping the pandemic at bay, but recognition of individual professions' efforts have been inconsistent at all levels. Pharmacists around the world have continued to provide direct patient care and perform frontline duties for their communities during this pandemic, but are often relegated to the background and overlooked when frontline workers are heralded. Community pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare practitioners, which is further proven during the pandemic as they continued to provide direct patient care despite restrictions imposed by the government due to the pandemic. Due to the inaccessibility of other healthcare practitioners during this time, community pharmacists have reduced the burden on the healthcare system by diverting the influx of patients away from hospitals through triaging and screening patients. Community pharmacists have played various roles in supporting the healthcare system during COVID-19: delivering medications to patients, educating patients on telehealth services, assessing patients for renewal of chronic medications, performing consultations on minor ailments, clarifying misconceptions about

5f7671868f71e4f374d0366bc4f5b11c17929cca	Introduction: Acute viral bronchiolitis (AB) is one of the most common respiratory diseases in infants. However, diagnostic criteria for AB are heterogeneous and not very well known. Objective: To identify the diagnostic criteria for AB used by experts and clinical paediatricians in Spain. Methods: Delphi study with Spanish AB experts, looking for the points of agreement about AB diagnosis. A subsequent cross-sectional study was conducted by means of an online questionnaire addressed to all Spanish paediatricians, reached through electronic mail messages sent by nine paediatric scientific societies. Descriptive and factorial analyses were carried out, looking for any association of diagnostic criteria with demographic or geographic variables, or with paediatric subspecialty. Results: Agreement was reached by 40 experts in many issues (first episode of respiratory distress and high respiratory frequency, diagnosis in any season of the year, and usefulness of virus identification in making diagnosis), but opposite views were maintained on key characteristics
10a28b3c3c02116da8339b7e4f1aaccb6b8780ac	Background: In December 2019, an unbelievable outbreak of pneumonia associated with coronavirus was reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province. This virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although much effort has been spent on clarifying the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, but, very little evidence is available regarding the relationship between human body fluids and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Considerable evidence from hospital in Wuhan indicates that strict rules to avoid occupational exposure to patients' body fluids in healthcare settings, particularly among every medical staff, limited person-to-person transmission of nosocomial infections by direct or indirect contact. We tried to provide important information for understanding the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 via body fluids including bronchoalveolar-lavage, saliva, blood, urine, feces, sputum, tears, and semen in order to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurrences.
c00007b831e0fc8d9b1105090c1efaf6da142bc6	1. Five species of psyllid occurred on seven species of Salk at Meade River, Alaska. Studies were made on the two common species P s y h plJmeni Lb'w and P.phlebophyZ&e Hodkinson. The former feeds on the phanerophytes M i x pulchm. S.hnata, S.alaxenSis and S.glauca, the latter on the chamaephytes S.phlebophylla and S.teticuhta 2. Both P.palmeni and P.phlebophylhe had a 1-year life cycle and nymphal development took place on the female M k catkin. The life cycle was generally closely synchronized with the period of catkin development. However, only a few eggs were laid on S.g&uca. 3.Se.asonal perturbation of the host plant by flooding, ice movement and blown sand prevented psyllids breeding in certain areas colonized by the host 4. In P.palmeni densities and 'feeding pressure', measured as biomass of psyllids per gram of catkin, on the different host plants followed the sequence S.puZchm > S.laMta > S.alarensis > S.gfauca. In P.phlebophyllae densities and feeding intensities were similar on S.phlebophyZla and S.rericulara and grazing intensity was comparable with P.palmeni on S.pulchra. A highly significant negative correlation was found between psyllid density and catkin dry weight in S.pulchm, S.phlebophylla and S.reticulata, suggesting that psyllid feeding is affecting catkin growth. 6. Predation of psyllid nymphs by syrphid larvae was heavy but there was no evidence of parasitism. 7. The life history strategies of the five psyllid species are discussed within the context of the constraints imposed by the arctic environment. plant.
f513f58f3b0468656b956aa6067d15e744edb486	Enveloped viruses exit their host cell by budding from a cellular membrane and thereby spread from one cell to another. Virus budding in general involves the distortion of a cellular membrane away from the cytoplasm, envelopment of the viral capsid by one or more lipid bilayers that are enriched in viral membrane glycoproteins, and a fission event that separates the enveloped virion from the cellular membrane. While it was initially thought that virus budding is always driven by viral transmembrane proteins interacting with the inner structural proteins, it is now clear that the driving force may be different depending on the virus. Research over the past years has shown that viral components specifically interact with host cell lipids and proteins, thereby adopting cellular functions and pathways to facilitate virus release. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the cellular membrane systems that serve as viral budding sites and of the viral and cellular factors involved in budding. One of the best studied cellular machineries required for virus egress is the ESCRT complex, which will be described in more detail.
50aa3305f87a409bd1601bdec5d3cd404fe825a3	BACKGROUND: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging virus globally associated with diarrhea. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prevalence of HBoV genotypes in children (≤5 years) from rural communities in South Africa (SA) suffering from AGE. A total of 141 fecal samples of children ≤5 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were collected from rural Primary Health Care facilities in the Vhembe district of SA between June 2017 and July 2018. Clinical symptoms and demographic data were also recorded. A total of 102 (72%) were outpatients and 39 (28%) were hospitalized patients. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) genotypes were determined using Real-Time Multiplex PCR. DNA extracts of positive samples were confirmed by conventional PCR targeting the NS1 gene. Co-infection with other enteric viruses were determined in HBoV positive samples using Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 8 (5.7%) children with AGE. Children were in the age group between 1-24 months. HBoV1 and HBoV3 genotypes were each detected in 3 (37.5%) stool samples and HBoV2 in 2 (25%) stool samples. Co-infection with other enteric viruses included Rotavirus (37.5%); Adenovirus (37.5%); Norovirus (25%) and Astrovirus (12.5%). CONCLUSION: HBoV infections could be seen as a potential emerging diarrheal pathogen in South Africa. Further studies are required to understand the role of HBoV infections in children and adults with acute gastroenteritis.
8b8ca242318308c085283f9e6bec962a13a00673	In February 2020, a Chinese cargo ship docked at the Port of Santos with reports of crew members with a feverish and respiratory condition. A team was gathered to verify the existence of suspected cases of COVID-19 inside the vessel and define its clearance. All 25 crew members were interviewed, and no suspected cases were found. The vessel was then cleared for port activities. The investigation resulted from the implementation of the contingency plan to face a public health emergency of international importance and several surveillance entities cooperated.
f8ac243a6a79ed8d5f7907250ac332c24fbef0b6	Hospitals worldwide are facing an increasing incidence of hard-to-treat infections. Limiting infections and providing patients with optimal drug regimens require timely strain identification as well as virulence and drug-resistance profiling. Additionally, prophylactic interventions based on the identification of environmental sources of recurrent infections (e.g., contaminated sinks) and reconstruction of transmission chains (i.e., who infected whom) could help to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections. WGS could hold the key to solving these issues. However, uptake in the clinic has been slow. Some major scientific and logistical challenges need to be solved before WGS fulfils its potential in clinical microbial diagnostics. In this review we identify major bottlenecks that need to be resolved for WGS to routinely inform clinical intervention and discuss possible solutions. Thanks to progress in high-throughput sequencing technologies over the last two decades, generating microbial genomes is now considered neither particularly challenging nor expensive. As a result, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (see Glossary) has been championed as the obvious and inevitable future of diagnostics in multiple reviews and opinion pieces dating back to 2010 [1] [2] [3] [4] . Despite enthusiasm in the community, WGS diagnostics has not yet been widely adopted in clinical microbiology, which may seem at odds with the current suite of applications for which WGS has huge potential, and which are already widely used in the academic literature. Common applications of WGS in diagnostic microbiology include isolate characterization, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling, and establishing the sources of recurrent infections and between-patient transmissions. All of these have obvious clinical relevance and provide case studies where WGS could, in principle, provide additional information and even replace the knowledge obtained through standard clinical microbiology techniques. This review reiterates the potential of WGS for clinical microbiology, but also its current limitations, and suggests possible solutions to some of the main bottlenecks to routine implementation. In particular, we argue that applying existing WGS pipelines developed for fundamental research is unlikely to produce the fast and robust tools required, and that new dedicated approaches are needed for WGS in the clinic. At the most basic level, WGS can be used to characterize a clinical isolate, informing on the likely species and/or subtype and allowing phylogenetic placement of a given sequence relative to an existing set of isolates. WGS-based strain identification gives a far superior resolution Highlights In principle, WGS can provide highly relevant information for clinical microbiology in near-real-time, from phenotype testing to tracking outbreaks. However, despite this promise, the uptake of WGS in the clinic has been limited to date, and future implementation is likely to be a slow process. The increasing information provided by WGS can cause conflict with traditional microbiological concepts and typing schemes. Decreasing raw sequencing costs have not translated into decreasing total costs for bacterial genomes, which have stabilised. Existing research pipelines are not suitable for the clinic, and bespoke clinical pipelines should be developed.

Various vaccination strategies against toxoplasmosis in rodent models have been used in the past few decades; however, effective vaccines remain a challenge. A recombinant adenovirus vaccine expressing ubiquitin-conjugated multi-stage antigen segments (Ad-UMAS) derived from different life-cycle stages of T. gondii was constructed previously. Here, we compared the immune responses and protection effects in vaccination of mice with Ad-UMAS by five vaccination routes including intramuscular (i.m.), intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intraoral (i.o.), and intranasal (i.n.). Much higher levels of T. gondii-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the sera of the intraoral and intranasal vaccination groups on day 49 compared with controls (p < 0.05). The percentages of CD8 + T-cells in mice immunized intranasally and intraorally were larger than in mice immunized intramuscularly (p < 0.05). The highest level of IL-2 and IFN-c was detected in the group with nasal immunization, and splenocyte proliferation activity was significantly enhanced in mice immunized via the oral and nasal routes. Furthermore, the higher survival rate (50%) and lower cyst numbers observed in the intraoral and intranasal groups all indicate that Ad-UMAS is far more effective in protecting mice against T. gondii infection via the mucosal route. Ad-UMAS could be an effective and safe mucosal candidate vaccine to protect animals and humans against T. gondii infection. Résumé -La vaccination par adénovirus recombinant exprimant des antigènes multi-stades de Toxoplasma gondii par voie muqueuse induit des réponses immunitaires systémiques cellulaires et locales muqueuses meilleures que d'autres voies de vaccination. La toxoplasmose, causée par Toxoplasma gondii, un protozoaire intracellulaire obligatoire, est une cause de maladie congénitale et d'avortement chez l'homme et chez l'animal. Différentes stratégies de vaccination contre la toxoplasmose, chez les rongeurs, ont été employées au cours des dernières décennies, mais obtenir un vaccin efficace demeure un défi. Un vaccin d'adénovirus recombinant exprimant des segments d'antigènes multi-stades conjugués à l'ubiquitine (Ad-UMAS), dérivés de différents stades du cycle de vie de T. gondii, a été construit précédemment. Dans cette étude, nous avons comparé les réponses immunitaires et les effets de protection de la vaccination des souris avec Ad-UMAS par cinq voies de vaccination, y compris intramusculaire, intraveineuse, sous-cutanée, intra-orale et intranasale. Des taux beaucoup plus élevés d'anticorps IgG et IgA spécifiques de T. gondii ont été détectés dans le sérum des groupes de souris des vaccinations intra-orales et intranasale au jour 49, par rapport aux témoins (p < 0.05).

ff3108b1350cdc68b51deaae22da8053f4c84734	Mounting evidence supports the role of pulmonary hemodynamic alternations in the pathogenesis of . Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in pulmonary blood volumes measured on CT are associated with histopathological markers of pulmonary vascular pruning, suggesting that quantitative HRCT analysis may eventually be useful in the assessment pulmonary vascular dysfunction more broadly. Building upon previous work, automated HRCT measures of small blood vessel volume and pulmonary vascular density were developed. Scans from 103 COVID-19 patients and 108 healthy volunteers were analyzed and their results compared, with comparisons made both on lobar and global levels. Compared to healthy volunteers, COVID-19 patients showed significant reduction in BV5 (pulmonary blood volume contained in blood vessels of <5 mm 2 ) expressed as BV5/(Total pulmonary blood volume) (p<0.0001), and significant increases in BV5_10 and BV 10 (pulmonary blood volumes contained in vessels between 5 and 10 mm 2 and above 10 mm 2 , respectively) (p<0.0001). These changes were consistent across lobes. COVID-19 patients display striking anomalies in the distribution of blood volume within the pulmonary vascular tree, consistent with increased pulmonary vasculature resistance in the pulmonary vessels below the resolution of HRCT.
b974706d8364e8f0c7d184ffdb0d331b0425b86f	An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has spread around the world. It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious. We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers. 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test. In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.
2afcf2ab2330cb56ec493f82d87fa0c5b5f076e9	The ideal method to encourage uptake of clinical guidelines in hospitals is not known. Several strategies have been suggested. This study evaluates the impact of academic detailing and a computerised decision support system (CDSS) on clinicians' prescribing behaviour for patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The management of all patients presenting to the emergency department over three successive time periods was evaluated; the baseline, academic detailing and CDSS periods. The rate of empiric antibiotic prescribing that was concordant with recommendations was studied over time comparing pre and post periods and using an interrupted time series analysis. The odds ratio for concordant therapy in the academic detailing period, after adjustment for age, illness severity and suspicion of aspiration, compared with the baseline period was OR = 2.79 [1.88, 4.14], p < 0.01, and for the computerised decision support period compared to the academic detailing period was OR = 1.99 [1.07, 3.69], p = 0.02. During the first months of the computerised decision support period an improvement in the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing was demonstrated, which was greater than that expected to have occurred with time and academic detailing alone, based on predictions from a binary logistic model. Deployment of a computerised decision support system was associated with an early improvement in antibiotic prescribing practices which was greater than the changes seen with academic detailing. The sustainability of this intervention requires further evaluation.
7ec66c4094f0fb7e5bd193e9202965ba0f3f7fa4	Linearizability is the de facto correctness criterion for concurrent data type implementations. Violation of linearizability is witnessed by an error trace in which the outputs of individual operations do not match those of a sequential execution of the same operations. Extensive work has been done in discovering linearizability violations, but little work has been done in trying to provide useful hints to the programmer when a violation is discovered by a tester tool. In this paper, we propose an approach that identifies the root causes of linearizability errors in the form of code blocks whose atomicity is required to restore linearizability. The key insight of this paper is that the problem can be reduced to a simpler algorithmic problem of identifying minimal root causes of conflict serializability violation in an error trace combined with a heuristic for identifying which of these are more likely to be the true root cause of non-linearizability. We propose theoretical results outlining this reduction, and an algorithm to solve the simpler problem. We have implemented our approach and carried out several experiments on realistic concurrent data types demonstrating its efficiency.
dad485e33fcf206128fe9e8ab2e5ee85ef114e98	Background and Objectives Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a routine clinical procedure performed to treat patients with haematological malignancies, primary immune deficiencies or metabolic disorders. Infections during lymphopenia after allogeneic HSCT are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Typical infectious agents are Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus and fungi. The study aim was to evaluate whether measurement of the responses of antigen-specific T-cells, recognizing infectious pathogens would correlate to protective functions in the stem cell recipient post-transplant. Twenty-one grafts were analysed by flow cytometry and cells were stimulated in vitro with relevant infectious antigens, followed by evaluation of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Results were compared to the recipients' clinical records 1-year post-transplantation. We show that an extensive repertoire of transferred antigen-specific T-cells from allogeneic donor grafts against infectious agents, involved in post-transplant infections, are linked to an absence of infectious complications for the recipient up-to 1-year post-transplant. The protective effect was associated with antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and IL-1b secretion. Conclusion Our results suggest that assaying T-cell function before HSCT could determine individual risks for infectious complications and thus aid in clinical decision-making regarding prophylactic and pre-emptive anti-infective therapy.
122a65c1048af4785f6db91589bd0086a16a091f	The pandemic caused by the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to considerable interest in its evolutionary origin and genome structure. Here, we analyzed mutation patterns in 34 human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and a closely related RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis (a horseshoe bat). We also evaluated the CpG dinucleotide contents in SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal coronavirus genomes. Out of 1136 single nucleotide variations (~4% divergence) between human SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13, 682 (60%) can be attributed to C>U and U>C substitutions, far exceeding other types of substitutions. An accumulation of C>U mutations was also observed in SARS-CoV2 variants that arose within the human population. Globally, the C>U substitutions increased the frequency of codons for hydrophobic amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 peptides, while U>C substitutions decreased it. In contrast to most other coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 exhibited CpG depletion in their genomes. The data suggest that C-to-U conversion mediated by C deamination played a significant role in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. We hypothesize that the high frequency C>U transitions reflect virus adaptation processes in their hosts, and that SARS-CoV-2 could have been evolving for a relatively long period in humans following the transfer from animals before spreading worldwide.
086edc5aa469bdeedcc50010957975af5986f181	During the current coronavirus pandemic, social distancing and restrictions on travel have resulted in a dramatic rise in the use of technology (including video conferencing) for remote meetings. From local multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings to national and international committees, this form of communication has been vital to ensure patient-related and other business can continue, albeit in a sometimes unfamiliar environment. In this article we consider some of the human factors elements of remote meetings and provide suggestions to enhance the experience of team and committee members during this unsettling time. It is possible that this form of communication will continue to flourish after the pandemic is over. Please cite this article in press as: Oeppen RS, et al.

d0620683a194e739baca5c13917899ad7e5b2337	Identification and discovery of viruses using next-generation sequencing technology is a fastdeveloping area with potential wide application in clinical diagnostics, public health monitoring and novel virus discovery. However, tremendous sequence data from NGS study has posed great challenge both in accuracy and velocity for application of NGS study. Here we describe VIP ("Virus Identification Pipeline"), a one-touch computational pipeline for virus identification and discovery from metagenomic NGS data. VIP performs the following steps to achieve its goal: (i) map and filter out background-related reads, (ii) extensive classification of reads on the basis of nucleotide and remote amino acid homology, (iii) multiple k-mer based de novo assembly and phylogenetic analysis to provide evolutionary insight. We validated the feasibility and veracity of this pipeline with sequencing results of various types of clinical samples and public datasets. VIP has also contributed to timely virus diagnosis (~10 min) in acutely ill patients, demonstrating its potential in the performance of unbiased NGS-based clinical studies with demand of short turnaround time. VIP is released under GPLv3 and is available for free download at: https://github.com/keylabivdc/VIP. The world contains a high diversity of human viral pathogens. There are approximately 300 recognized viral pathogen species, and additional species continue to be discovered. The identification of viral pathogens has a tremendous impact on infectious diseases, virology and public health. Nearly all of the outbreaks of public health issues over the last decade have been caused by viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 1 , 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 2 , H7N9 avian influenza viruses 3 and the recently described Ebola virus in West Africa 4 . Traditional diagnostic methods for viruses, such as cell culture, serodiagnosis, or nucleic acid-based testing are narrow in scope and require a priori knowledge of the potential infectious agents 5,6 . Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment for the infection dramatically reduced the risk of continued transmission and mortality in hospitalized patients 7 . Wild interest in comprehensive detection of these newly emerging and re-emerging viruses from clinical samples highlight the need for rapid, broad-spectrum diagnostic assays. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples for viral pathogen identification provides a promising alternative solution. Although metagenomics is typically applied to understanding genomic diversity from environment samples, this methodology has also revolutionized virology with comprehensive applications, including viral pathogen identification of infectious disease in clinical laboratories 8 and virus discovery in acute and chronic illnesses of unknown origin 9 . Many novel viruses have been discovered using popular next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms such as pyrosequencing (454 Roche), semiconductor sequencing (Life Technology) and illumina dye sequencing (Illumina) 10-12 . Achievements obtained by viral metagenomics show significant advantages over traditional methods of identifying a viral pathogen, including no need of sequence information for that pathogen, identifying multiple pathogens in a single assay and eliminating the need for time-consuming culturing or antibody laboratory tests. A key feature of latest NGS platforms is their speed. It takes minimum turnaround times about 8 hours for sequencing 13 . Thus, it is critical that subsequent computational handling of the large amount of sequence
384aeafc2fba9e88eb8be90a973006e97d5b74a4	Viral infections are important causes of disease of the respiratory tract. Respiratory viral infections frequently complicate the course of patients with COPD and asthma. Infl uenza continues to be a major cause of mortality and serious morbidity, not only in the tropics but on a worldwide basis. Another viral pathogen that causes serious pneumonia in adults is the varicella-zoster virus. Recent years have seen the emergence of new respiratory pathogens, such as the avian and porcine infl uenza A viruses, the SARS coronaviruses, and the H1N1 virus. The need for advanced laboratory technology to investigate the etiology of viral infections is probably the main reason for the patchy data on viral pulmonary infection in the tropics. Because viral infections may be complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonias, invasive procedures would be needed to accurately differentiate among pure viral pneumonias, secondary bacterial pneumonias, and mixed viral and bacterial infections. The recommended approach to these infections is mainly preventive which includes vaccination (if available for the particular virus) and early medical consultation.
