ca3b7265e9ab5d09ba5875fad207d19392db7ad6	identifying nodes in social networks that have great influence on information dissemination is of great significance for monitoring and guiding information dissemination .
ca3b7265e9ab5d09ba5875fad207d19392db7ad6	there are few methods to study the influence of communities on social networks among the existing node importance evaluation algorithms , and it is difficult to find nodes that promote information dissemination among communities .
ca3b7265e9ab5d09ba5875fad207d19392db7ad6	in view of this reason , this paper proposes a node importance evaluation algorithm based on community influence ( abbreviated as ieboci algorithm ) , which evaluates the importance of the nodes based on the influence degree of the nodes on the communities and the ability to disseminate information the communities to which the nodes are connected .
ca3b7265e9ab5d09ba5875fad207d19392db7ad6	this algorithm firstly calculates the activation probability of nodes to other nodes , which is used to divide communities and evaluate influence .
ca3b7265e9ab5d09ba5875fad207d19392db7ad6	finally , the importance of the node is calculated by combining the influence of the community itself and the influence of the node on the community .

e47cc8571fdaa3c959a68ef22f892e2f4e0691b2	these water stressors are exacerbated by climate change , as well as the growth and urbanisation of industry and commerce .
e47cc8571fdaa3c959a68ef22f892e2f4e0691b2	consequently , urban water authorities around the globe are exploring alternative water sources to meet ever - increasing demands .
e47cc8571fdaa3c959a68ef22f892e2f4e0691b2	stormwater including roof - harvested rainwater has been considered as an alternative water source for both potable and non - potable uses .
e47cc8571fdaa3c959a68ef22f892e2f4e0691b2	one of the most significant issues concerning alternative water reuse is the public health risk associated with chemical and microbial contaminants .

6588151f5af88755147d98440e9477673a99e76e	we report on the covid-19 epidemic in italy in relation to the extraordinary measures implemented by the italian government between the 24th of february and the 12th of march .
6588151f5af88755147d98440e9477673a99e76e	we analysed the covid-19 cumulative incidence ( ci ) using data from the 1st to the 31st of march .
6588151f5af88755147d98440e9477673a99e76e	we estimated that in lombardy , the worst hit region in italy , the observed covid-19 ci diverged towards values lower than the ones expected in the absence of government measures approximately 7 - 10 days after the measures implementation .
6588151f5af88755147d98440e9477673a99e76e	the covid-19 ci growth rate peaked in lombardy the 22nd of march and in other regions between the 24th and the 27th of march .
6588151f5af88755147d98440e9477673a99e76e	our analyses suggest that the government measures slowed and eventually reduced the covid-19 ci growth where the epidemic had already reached high levels by mid - march ( lombardy , emilia - romagna and veneto ) and prevented the rise of the epidemic in regions of central and southern italy where the epidemic was at an earlier stage in mid - march to reach the high levels already present in northern regions .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	by applying the newly developed assay based on nanofluidic real time pcr system , we aimed to examine the association of multiple serotype colonization with acute respiratory infections ( ari ) and the inter - relationship of the serotypes in terms of bacterial load .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	nasopharyngeal samples from 595 hospital admitted ari cases and 350 healthy controls from nha trang
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	, veitnam were screened for streptococcus pneumoniae by culture and lyta pcr .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	samples positive for culture and lyta were subjected to the nanofluidic real time pcr system that can identify 50 serotypes in 29 groups , and it can detect minor population in the multiple serotype colonization , with the minimum level of detection of 30 to 300 copies .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	the prevalence of multiple serotype colonization was 2.5 times higher in cases than controls , 18.5 % versus 7.1 % ( odd ratio ( or ) 2.96 , 95 % ci : 1.37 - 6.93 , p = 0.002 ) .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	among serotypes of multiple serotype colonization , one serotype dominated over the other serotypes by contributing more than 99 % of the total pneumococcal load ( p < 0.001 ) .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	serotypes covered by conjugate vaccines : pcv7 , pcv10 and pcv13 were similar , 75 % in cases and 52 % in controls .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	we recently reported a significant association between picornavirus ( rhinovirus ) infection and both rates and density of pneumococcal ( sp ) carriage in pre - school children .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	in a further cross - sectional study in 586 children attending nurseries in coimbra portugal we took nasal swabs ( into stgg ) and recorded symptoms and demographics in march 2010 .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	samples underwent bacterial culture and rt - pcr for common respiratory viruses .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	there was a strong age - independent association between the presence and the density of sp and the presence and severity of symptoms of rhinitis .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	in contrast to our previous study , clear associations between sp and viral infection were not observed .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	nasal colonisation with sp is commonly described as asymptomatic .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	this study suggests that this may be misleading but does not show whether sp causes symptoms , rhinitis induces proliferation of sp , or both ( or neither ) .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	no conflict of interest pneumonia 2014 volume 3 background and aims :
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	the dynamics of streptococcus pneumoniae exhibit variation worldwide both in serotype composition and absolute prevalence .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	changes after vaccination targeting a subset of serotypes are bound to depend on the underlying transmission , competition and clearance rates , besides vaccine efficacy and coverage across host communities .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	assuming functional symmetry between serotypes , we find a continuum of stable coexistence equilibria pre - vaccine , with varying serotype composition , but where the total prevalences of colonization and co - colonization are constrained by serotypetranscending parameters .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	the post - vaccination scenario is primarily determined by the proportion of the population vaccinated and the per - capita vaccine - induced protection ; however these are dynamically integrated over time with a gradually diminishing exposure to vaccine serotypes ( vt ) , and with the indirect effects of competition from non - vaccine serotypes ( nvt ) .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	we fit these models to cross - sectional data from portugal ( 2001portugal ( -2007 , linking mechanistically the pre - and post - vaccine era .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	examining how the vt - nvt system re - adjusts post - vaccination , we find that serotype replacement occurs gradually , due to sustained positive feedback between vaccine protection against vt and general serotype competition .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	vaccine efficacy , when accounting for such feedback , is around 16 % ( 95%ci : 0.12 - 0.21 ) , the relative rate of acquisition in already colonized hosts is 0.08 ( 95%ci : 0.05 - 0.11 ) , while the monthly per - capita transmission rate is 1.86 ( 95%ci :
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	our results emphasize the role of dynamical coupling between epidemiological variables when evaluating vaccine effects in multi - type bacterial communities .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	since animal models suggest that influenza infection favors nasopharyngeal acquisition of pneumococci , we assessed this relationship with influenza and other respiratory viruses in young children .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	a case - control study was nested within a prospective cohort study of acute respiratory illness ( ari ) in andean children <3 years of age ( respira - peru study ) .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	weekly household visits were made to identify ari and obtain nasal swabs for viral detection using real - time pcr ( rt - pcr ) .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	monthly nasopharyngeal ( np ) samples were obtained to assess pneumococcal colonization .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	we determined whether specific respiratory viral ari occurring within the interval between consecutive np samples ( episodes of observation ) increased the risk of nasopharyngeal acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	a total of 729 children contributed 2128 episodes of observation , including 681 pneumococcal acquisition episodes ( new serotype compared to prior sample ) , 1029 non - acquisition episodes ( no colonization or persistent colonization with the same serotype as the prior sample ) and 418 indeterminate episodes .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	the risk of pneumococcal acquisition increased following influenza - ari ( adjusted odds ratio : 2.19 , 95 % ci : 1.02 - 4.69 ) and parainfluenza - ari ( 1.86 , 95 % ci : 1.15 - 3.01 ) , when compared with episodes without ari .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	other viral infections ( respiratory syncytial virus , human metapneumovirus , human rhinovirus and adenovirus ) were not associated with acquisition ( figure ) .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	influenza and parainfluenza aris appeared to facilitate pneumococcal acquisition among young children .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	as acquisition increases the risk of pneumococcal diseases , these observations are pivotal in our attempts to prevent pneumococcal disease .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	nasopharyngeal carriage studies provide an insight into the local prevalence of circulating pneumococcal serotypes .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	there are very few data on the concurrent carriage of multiple pneumococcal serotypes .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	this study aimed to identify the prevalence and serotype distribution of pneumococci carried in the nasopharynx of young healthy nepalese children prior to the introduction of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine using a microarray method capable of detecting multi - serotype carriage .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	nasopharyngeal swabs were frozen and subsequently plated on selective culture media .
a82e0621f4cdce17ce1003ba356f03af348f1cda	plate sweeps of pneumococcal colonies from these cultures were processed by dna microarray capable of detecting relative abundance of multiple pneumococcal serotypes .

9ab6ec8904663d9022d8b23471007b7cd5320d3a	ct images plays an essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive clinical care .
9ab6ec8904663d9022d8b23471007b7cd5320d3a	however , it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in ct images , due to variable infection regions in the lungs , similar imaging biomarkers , and large intercase variations .
9ab6ec8904663d9022d8b23471007b7cd5320d3a	to this end , we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of covid-19 in 3d ct images , by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi - instance classification .

3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	we have previously shown that a non - structural protein 1 ( ns1)-binding monoclonal antibody , termed as 2h6 , can significantly reduce influenza a virus ( iav ) replication when expressed intracellularly .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	in this study , we further showed that 2h6 binds stronger to the ns1 of h5n1 than a / puerto rico/8/1934(h1n1 ) because of an amino acid difference at residue 48 .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	a crystal structure of 2h6 fragment antigen - binding ( fab ) has also been solved and docked onto the ns1 structure to reveal the contacts between specific residues at the interface of antibody - antigen complex .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	in one of the models , the predicted molecular contacts between residues in ns1 and 2h6-fab correlate well with biochemical results .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	taken together , residues n48 and t49 in h5n1 ns1 act cooperatively to maintain a strong interaction with mab 2h6 by forming hydrogen bonds with residues found in the heavy chain of the antibody .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	interestingly , the pandemic h1n1 - 2009 and the majority of seasonal h3n2 circulating in humans since 1968 has n48 in ns1 , suggesting that mab 2h6 could bind to most of the currently circulating seasonal influenza a virus strains .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	consistent with the involvement of residue t49 , which is well - conserved , in rna binding , mab 2h6 was also found to inhibit the interaction between ns1 and double - stranded rna .

3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	seasonal iavs are one of the major causes of respiratory tract infections and responsible for 3 - 5 million clinical infections and 250,000 - 500,000 fatal cases annually 1 .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	iav is a negative sense single - stranded rna virus with segmented genomes 2 , which belongs to the family orthomyxoviridae and is subtyped based on its surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin ( ha ) and neuraminidase ( na ) .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	currently , vaccination is still considered the first line of defence against influenza viral infection 5 , however it needs to be reformulated annually due to the genetic variability of the virus 6 .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	the conventional influenza vaccine aims to stimulate immunity to produce antibodies against the viral envelope ha protein .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	unfortunately , these antibodies are mainly strain specific , in which case iav might be able to evade the recognition of the antibody by constantly mutating the antigenic determinants 7 .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	thus , one way to overcome this limitation is to produce and/or engineer antibodies that could neutralize most viral strains .
3256ad6795fb323a3711f3d3d6f7ae85657fc5ff	alternatively , another option to combat iav is the use of antiviral compounds , which include two classes of drugs .

33dbabc6a5a1139b343dc75dd63ddf895651e791	the purpose of this work is to make a case for epidemiological models with fractional exponent in the contribution of sub - populations to the transmission rate .
33dbabc6a5a1139b343dc75dd63ddf895651e791	more specifically , we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models , where the transmission rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub - populations ; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups .
33dbabc6a5a1139b343dc75dd63ddf895651e791	as a result , the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead .
33dbabc6a5a1139b343dc75dd63ddf895651e791	the intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells , in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub - populations .

7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	avian infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis , which results in considerable economic losses .
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	it is imperative to develop safe and efficient candidate vaccines to control ibv infection .
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	in the current study , recombinant baculoviruses co - expressing the s1 and n proteins and mono - expressing s1 or n proteins of the gx - yl5 strain of ibv were constructed and prepared into subunit vaccines rhbm - s1-n , rhbm - s1 and rhbm - n.
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	the levels of immune protection of these subunit vaccines were evaluated by inoculating specific pathogen - free ( spf ) chickens at 14 days of age , giving them a booster with the same dose 14 days later and challenging them with a virulent gx - yl5 strain of ibv 14 days post - booster ( dpb ) .
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	the commercial vaccine strain h120 was used as a control .
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	the morbidity , mortality and re - isolation of the virus from the tracheas and kidneys of challenged birds were evaluated at five days post - challenge ( dpc ) .
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	t lymphocytes were higher in the rhbm - s1-n vaccinated birds compared to birds vaccinated with the rhbm - s1 and rhbm - n vaccines .
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	at 5 dpc , the mortality , morbidity and virus re - isolation rate of the birds vaccinated with the rhbm - s1-n vaccine were slightly higher than those vaccinated with the h120 control vaccine but were lower than those vaccinated with the rhbm - s1 and rhbm - n vaccines .
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	the present study demonstrated that the protection of the recombinant baculovirus co - expressing s1 and n proteins was better than that of recombinant baculoviruses mono - expressing the s1 or n protein .
7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef	thus , the recombinant baculovirus co - expressing s1 and n proteins could serve as a potential ibv vaccine and this demonstrates that the bivalent subunit vaccine including the s1 and n proteins might be a strategy for the development of an ibv subunit vaccine .
aca9ae47fe5c97687239c1d3df2a905afdae2604	the ifnl4 gene is a recently discovered type iii interferon , which in a significant fraction of the human population harbours a frameshift mutation abolishing the ifnk4 orf .
aca9ae47fe5c97687239c1d3df2a905afdae2604	the expression of ifnk4 is correlated with both poor spontaneous clearance of hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) and poor response to treatment with type i interferon .
aca9ae47fe5c97687239c1d3df2a905afdae2604	here , we show that the ifnl4 gene encodes an active type iii interferon , named ifnk4 , which signals through the ifnkr1 and il-10r2 receptor chains .
aca9ae47fe5c97687239c1d3df2a905afdae2604	recombinant ifnk4 is antiviral against both hcv and coronaviruses at levels comparable to ifnk3 .
aca9ae47fe5c97687239c1d3df2a905afdae2604	however , the secretion of ifnk4 is impaired compared to that of ifnk3 , and this impairment is not due to a weak signal peptide , which was previously believed .
aca9ae47fe5c97687239c1d3df2a905afdae2604	together , these findings result in the paradox that ifnk4 is strongly antiviral but a disadvantage during hcv infection .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	nutrient timing involves manipulation of nutrient consumption at specific times in and around exercise bouts in an effort to improve performance , recovery , and adaptation .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	as research continued , translational focus remained primarily on the impact and outcomes related to nutrient consumption during one specific time period to the exclusion of all others .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	as consumption of nutrients does not occur at only one time point in the day , the effect and impact of energy and macronutrient availability becomes an important consideration in determining timing of additional nutrients in and around training and competition .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	using this approach , it is argued that the concept of nutrient timing is constrained by reliance on interpretation of an " anabolic window " and may be better viewed as a " garage door of opportunity " to positively impact performance , recovery , and athlete availability .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	including insulin and its counter - regulatory hormones ( i.e. , glucagon , epinephrine , norepinephrine , cortisol , growth hormone , etc . )
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	in general , insulin shows a marked decrease , while the secretion of counter - regulatory hormones increases .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	these changes are metabolically critical for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis and for activating enzymes responsible for increasing mobilization and oxidation of fuels stored within the muscle ( i.e. , glycogen and intramuscular triglycerides ) and throughout the body ( i.e. , liver glycogen and adipocyte - stored triglycerides ) .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	additionally , independent of insulin , skeletal muscle contraction and the presence of metabolic byproducts stimulate the translocation of glut4 to the sarcolemma to further aid in glucose uptake in the muscle [ 9 ] .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	these actions also occur during long - duration , low - to - moderate - intensity exercise .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	based on these physiological responses , ivy and portman [ 7 ] postulated that post - exercise feeding could be used to attenuate the large catabolic shift that occurs during exercise to favor a more anabolic state .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	this post - exercise time period was seen to represent an opportunity to enhance adaptation and recovery though nutrition and became known as the " metabolic or anabolic window " due to the enhanced sensitivity of skeletal muscle to nutrient uptake and metabolism .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	this period was hypothesized to last approximately 45 min while glut4 activity remains elevated and glycogen synthase action increases even without stimulation by insulin [ 10 ] .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	additionally , in the absence of cho availability during this period , the proteolytic action of cortisol results in the breakdown of muscle protein and release of alanine to serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis and , ultimately , glycogen resynthesis [ 11 ] .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	additionally , the role of protein intake during this period has been emphasized particularly in the context of resistance exercise as mechanical stress coupled with dietary protein or essential amino acids ( eaa ) alone , especially leucine , lead to significant increases in muscle protein synthesis ( mps )
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	one of the most prominent nutrient timing studies on the role of muscular strength and hypertrophy was conducted by cribb and hayes [ 13 ] .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	they showed that a combined cho and pro supplement administered in a roughly 1:1 ratio ( e.g. , 32 g pro and 34 g cho for an 80 kg individual ) plus creatine monohydrate consumed both pre - and post - exercise resulted in greater strength and hypertrophy adaptations compared with consuming the same supplement in the morning and at night for 10 weeks in resistance - trained men .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	while acute metabolic responses were not measured in these studies , the combined cho and pro supplement may have had a larger insulinogenic response and , although this hormone does not affect mps , insulin has been shown to attenuate muscle protein breakdown in the post - exercise period [ 16 ] .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	this anticatabolic effect of insulin may have contributed to the significant differences in body composition changes between groups over the 10-week period in one study but not the other .
69513275a72c2d1730109955e7c9977a0c78fe4c	the existence of a post - exercise " anabolic window " has recently been called into question [ 17 , 18 ] .

72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	meningitis is commonly caused by infection with a variety of bacterial or viral pathogens .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	acute bacterial meningitis ( abm ) can cause severe disease , which can progress rapidly to a critical life - threatening condition .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	rapid diagnosis of abm is critical , as this is most commonly associated with severe sequelae with associated high mortality and morbidity rates compared to viral meningitis , which is less severe and self - limiting .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	this has been validated using randomly amplified dna targets ( radt ) , comparing buffers with or without formamide , in glass slide format or on the alere arraytube tm ( alere technologies gmbh ) microarray platform .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	pathogen - specific signals were observed using purified bacterial nucleic acids and to a lesser extent using patient cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) samples , with some technical issues observed using radt and glass slides .

72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	however , this form of meningitis can be mimicked by intracellular bacterial infections including rickettsia spp .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	acute viral meningitis ( avm ) tends to occur in epidemics and is usually a mild , self - limiting disease in the immunocompetent patient .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	it can be caused by a wide range of viral agents , but typically enteroviruses and herpesviruses [ 4 ]
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	despite the usually mild nature of these viral infections , they can also be associated with more serious acute viral encephalitis ( ave ) , which has high mortality rates and survivors can develop chronic conditions , including significant neurological deficits .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	acute bacterial meningitis ( abm ) can cause more fulminant disease [ 3 , 7 , 8 ] and progression to a critical life - threatening septicemia can be extremely rapid .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	the most common causes in healthy adults are haemophilus influenzae , streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcal disease ) and neisseria meningitidis ( meningococcal disease ) .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	in neonates , the elderly and immunocompromised individuals escherichia coli , streptococcus agalactiae ( gbs )

72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	in the early stages of disease the etiological agents responsible for abm , avm , and ave are extremely difficult to diagnose due to clinical symptoms of a diffuse and nonspecific nature [ 14 ]
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	therefore , empirical treatments of ceftriaxone and acyclovir , plus or minus dexamethasone or amoxicillin are administered a soon as possible and pre - emptive isolation of the patient is undertaken until a diagnosis is made [ 17 ] .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	serology and imaging of the brain may help to confirm a diagnosis and inform treatment .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	many diagnostic laboratories therefore augment their diagnostic capabilities with the use of molecular methods for identification of meningitis - associated bacterial [ 21 , 22 ] and viral pathogens [ 23 ]
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	these are primarily real - time qualitative polymerase chain reaction assays ( rt - pcr ) , which are available for a limited number of meningitis - associated pathogens .

72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	serogrouping of most meningitis - associated strains is conducted using a range of methods
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	there is a need for development of other rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods with the capability for simultaneously assaying for multiple bacterial and viral agents and which discriminate between different strains and serogroups .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	these have been the focus of considerable attention in previous years for a range of analytical processes [ 34 ]
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	the use of these multiplexed analysis systems has been widely accepted previously , as a means for augmenting frontline traditional diagnostics , as they offer many advantages over traditional monoplex molecular technologies .
72d786b072bf999b5925c527f2b1e8dcf326247e	microarrays have further benefits over established block - based or real - time pcr tests because they require less prior knowledge of the infectious agent [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] .
602981d75e74595af0e2de9e046a9cc9e05a1c0e	we previously reported widespread differential expression of long non - protein - coding rnas ( ncrnas ) in response to virus infection .
602981d75e74595af0e2de9e046a9cc9e05a1c0e	here , we expanded the study through small rna transcriptome sequencing analysis of the host response to both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) and influenza virus infections across four founder mouse strains of the collaborative cross , a recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits .

602981d75e74595af0e2de9e046a9cc9e05a1c0e	we demonstrated that virus infection also altered expression of many short ncrnas of diverse classes .
602981d75e74595af0e2de9e046a9cc9e05a1c0e	putting the results of the two studies together , we show that small rnas may also play an important role in regulating the host response to virus infection .

820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	the sars - cov-2 pandemic is a healthcare crisis caused by insufficient knowledge applicable to effectively combat the virus .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	this relies on a solid theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of sars - cov-2 infection and host responses , which is coupled to the practical experience of clinicians that are treating patients .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	because sars - cov-2 enters the cell by binding to angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , targeting ace2 to prevent such binding seems an obvious strategy to combat infection .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	this means that preventing uptake of ace2 into the cell by blocking at1r would be a more logical approach to limit entry of sars - cov-2 into the cell .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	since ace2 plays an important protective role in maintaining key biological processes , treatments should not disrupt the functional capacity of ace2 , to counterbalance the negative effects of the infection .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	based on known mechanisms and knowledge of the characteristics of sars - cov we propose the hypothesis that the immune system facilitates sars - cov-2 replication which disrupts immune regulatory mechanisms .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	the proposed mechanism by which sars - cov-2 causes disease immediately suggests a possible treatment , since the at1r is a key player in this whole process .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	at1r antagonists appear to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of sars - cov-2 infection .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	at1r antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of angiotesnin ii and , in addition , they might even be involved in preventing the cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ace2 function .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	at1r antagonists are widely available , cheap , and safe .
820cf100aabf6364430a4bf742c875be93134dc6	therefore , we propose to consider using at1r antagonists in the treatment of sars - cov-2 .

c8d19a60e1b055aebfd027794ae6676ccdfadcf9	the italian outbreak of covid-19 cases is a public health emergency and there is a worldwide tremendous interest in the evaluation of the italian epidemic evolution .
c8d19a60e1b055aebfd027794ae6676ccdfadcf9	indeed , from february 2020 , italy is facing an explosion of covid-19 cases .
c8d19a60e1b055aebfd027794ae6676ccdfadcf9	in particular , the italian observed case fatality rate ( cfr ) is much higher than the other countries .
c8d19a60e1b055aebfd027794ae6676ccdfadcf9	however , through an analysis performed for all the italian regions , here it is shown that the deaths are localized in specific regions and that the cfrs of different italian regions are overlapping with the rates of european countries .
c8d19a60e1b055aebfd027794ae6676ccdfadcf9	moreover , through correlation analyses between cfrs and different social habits , it is shown that no positive correlation is observed between social behaviors and cfrs .
c8d19a60e1b055aebfd027794ae6676ccdfadcf9	in conclusion , this analysis clearly rejects the possibility that social habits and intergenerational contacts can contribute to explaining such a profound effect on the number of deaths observed in italy during the covid-19 outbreak and more effort should be addressed to evaluate the real amount of positive cases .

f63c50c272264b2496a48262ccc5676929374347	this increase in morbidity and mortality is modest and should be weighed against the real benefits of bariatric surgery in patient with obesity and diabetes mellitus .
c048b99410fbc8f0dfbf295cee96b716ce63518d	in the uk , cases of covid-19 have been declining since mid - april and there is good evidence to suggest that the effective reproduction number has dropped below 1 , leading to a multiphase relaxation plan for the country to emerge from lockdown .
c048b99410fbc8f0dfbf295cee96b716ce63518d	as part of this staggered process , primary schools are scheduled to partially reopen on 1st june .
c048b99410fbc8f0dfbf295cee96b716ce63518d	evidence from a range of sources suggests that children are , in general , only mildly affected by the disease and have low mortality rates , though there is less certainty regarding children 's role in transmission .
c048b99410fbc8f0dfbf295cee96b716ce63518d	this is assessed through model simulation , modifying a previously developed dynamic transmission model for sars - cov-2 .
c048b99410fbc8f0dfbf295cee96b716ce63518d	we quantify how the process of reopening schools affected contact patterns and anticipated secondary infections , the relative change in r according to the extent of school reopening , and determine the public health impact via estimated change in clinical cases and its sensitivity to decreases in adherence post strict lockdown .
c048b99410fbc8f0dfbf295cee96b716ce63518d	whilst reopening schools , in any form , results in more mixing between children , an increase in r and hence transmission of the disease , the magnitude of that increase can be low dependent upon the age - groups that return to school and the behaviour of the remaining population .

7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	neither enalapril nor losartan changed abundance of ace2 mrna in lung , ileum , kidney , and heart .
7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	tmprss2 mrna was abundant in lungs and ileum , modest in kidney , but barely detectable in heart .
7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	mrna abundance was not altered by either enalapril or losartan in any of the 4 tissues .
7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	next , we determined whether depletion of angiotensinogen ( agt ) , the unique substrate of the renin - angiotensin system , changes ace2 and tmprss2

7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	our data support that the renin - angiotensin inhibition does not regulate ace2 and hence are not likely to increase risk for covid-19 .

7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	after 21 days of agt depletion , elevated plasma renin levels supported ras blockade ( figure d ) .
7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	interestingly , agt aso significantly decreased tmprss2 mrna abundance in lungs ( figure f ) .
7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	in summary , ras inhibition did not affect mrna abundance of ace2 in male c57bl/6j mice administered enalapril , losartan , or agt aso .
7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	agt aso reduces tmprss2 mrna expression in lungs , which is potentially protective against viral entry .
7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	these data support that ras inhibition per se does not regulate ace2 and hence is unlikely to increase the risk for covid-19 .
7789866d4927965efc3e6f24f21bb14852e2f553	in agreement with this concept , sama et al . 6 recently were unable to detect changes in circulating ace2 in patients taking ras inhibitors .

5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	based on the evolutionary similarity with sars - cov , researchers propose that sars - cov-2 can invade the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal ( gi ) system through angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	however , how sars - cov-2 causes neurological or gi symptoms is not clear .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	many suggested intestinal and neural inflammations , caused by viral invasion , as the most likely reason for the gi and neurological symptoms ; however , the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) without neurological or gi symptoms indicate that this is not the case .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	the gut - brain axis could explain the reason for why some with covid-19 do not have these symptoms .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	covid-19 patients mostly show respiratory distress first , then diarrhea , anorexia , stroke , or loss of consciousness comes into view .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	obviously , gi invasion is a mechanical process that begins with oral invasion and , therefore , most probably exists before the brain invasion , as indicated in case reports .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	however , when the gi tract is invaded , the virus may enter the central nervous system through vascular and lymphatic systems or the vagal nerve .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	sars - cov-2 can infect leukocytes and migrate with them into the brain , or the viral particles can be directly transported across the blood - brain barrier to the brain .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	also , more recent research has revealed that sars - cov-2 can invade the peripheral lymphatic vessels connecting with the glymphatic system of the brain .
5af83727e1f93433d0ed2e9576a457a1676a786a	the temporal correlation between neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms suggests the lymph vessels around the gi tract , the vascular system , or the gut - brain axis ( enteric nervous system ) as the most likely entry route for sars - cov-2 to the brain .

586316e4ba8fae180a835b3898cbcb2b9d7c7c60	the products of these isgs exert numerous antiviral effector functions , many of which are still not fully described .
586316e4ba8fae180a835b3898cbcb2b9d7c7c60	recent efforts have been aimed at identifying which isgs are antiviral and further characterizing their mechanisms of action .
586316e4ba8fae180a835b3898cbcb2b9d7c7c60	ifn effectors vary widely in their magnitude of inhibitory activity and display combinatorial antiviral properties .
586316e4ba8fae180a835b3898cbcb2b9d7c7c60	collectively , isgs can target almost any step in a virus life cycle .
586316e4ba8fae180a835b3898cbcb2b9d7c7c60	some of the most potent antiviral effectors reinforce the system by further inducing ifn or isgs .

a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	the 2019 novel coronavirus ( sars - cov-2 ) is a new human coronavirus which is spreading with epidemic features in china and other asian countries ; cases have also been reported worldwide .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	this novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) , covid-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic , epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	aims : to provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis , epidemiology and clinical features of covid-19 , sars and mers .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	the most recent literature in the english language regarding covid-19 has been reviewed , and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about sars and mers epidemics .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	content : covid-19 seems not to be very different from sars regarding its clinical features .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	however , it has a fatality rate of 2.3 % , lower than that of sars ( 9.5 % ) and much lower than that of mers ( 34.4 % ) .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	the possibility can not be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of covid-19 it can spread in the community more easily than mers and sars .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	the actual basic reproductive number ( r 0 ) of covid-19 ( 2.0e2.5 ) is still controversial .
a616c816dc149d99a4a9e039e8f91c688265fda7	it is probably slightly higher than the r 0 of sars ( 1.7e1.9 ) and higher than that of mers ( < 1 ) .

2b44e09d62e33d64b699edfade2ce05dd9761c9d	ajmalicine is useful in circulatory disorders , while ajmaline is principally known for its antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive activities .
d2b714f43fa6302301a1aa7d282de555f71024b2	there is great interest in the development of ab - inducing subunit vaccines targeting infections , including hiv , malaria , and ebola .
d2b714f43fa6302301a1aa7d282de555f71024b2	we previously reported that adenovirus vectored vaccines are potent in priming ab responses , but uncertainty remains regarding the optimal approach for induction of humoral immune responses .
d2b714f43fa6302301a1aa7d282de555f71024b2	in this study , using ova as a model ag , we assessed the magnitude of the primary and anamnestic ag - specific igg responses of mice to four clinically relevant vaccine formulations : replication - deficient adenovirus ; modified vaccinia ankara ( a poxvirus ) ; protein with alum ; and protein in the squalene oil - inwater adjuvant addavax .
d2b714f43fa6302301a1aa7d282de555f71024b2	we then used flow cytometric assays capable of measuring total and ag - specific germinal center ( gc ) b cell and follicular th cell responses to compare the induction of these responses by the different formulations .
d2b714f43fa6302301a1aa7d282de555f71024b2	we report that adenovirus vectored vaccines induce ag insert - specific gc b cell and ab responses of a magnitude comparable to those induced by a potent protein / squalene oil - in - water formulation whereas - despite a robust overall gc response - the insert - specific gc b cell and ab responses induced by modified vaccinia ankara were extremely weak .
d2b714f43fa6302301a1aa7d282de555f71024b2	ag - specific follicular th cell responses to adenovirus vectored vaccines exceeded those induced by other platforms at day 7 after immunization .
d2b714f43fa6302301a1aa7d282de555f71024b2	we found little evidence that innate immune activation by adenovirus may act as an adjuvant in such a manner that the humoral response to a recombinant protein may be enhanced by coadministering with an adenovirus lacking a transgene of interest .
d2b714f43fa6302301a1aa7d282de555f71024b2	overall , these studies provide further support for the use of replication - deficient adenoviruses to induce humoral responses .

5b804f88f68fa6a81bf634c6740ff79253ba471a	sars - cov-2 has been marked as a highly pathogenic coronavirus of covid-19 disease into the human population , causing over 5.5 million confirmed cases worldwide .
5b804f88f68fa6a81bf634c6740ff79253ba471a	as covid-19 has posed a global threat with significant human casualties and severe economic losses , there is a pressing demand to further understand the current situation and develop rational strategies to contain the drastic spread of the virus .
5b804f88f68fa6a81bf634c6740ff79253ba471a	although there are no specific antiviral therapies that have proven effective in randomized clinical trials , currently , the rapid detection technology along with several promising therapeutics for covid-19 have mitigated its drastic transmission .
5b804f88f68fa6a81bf634c6740ff79253ba471a	besides , global institutions and corporations have commenced to parse out effective vaccines for the prevention of covid-19 .
5b804f88f68fa6a81bf634c6740ff79253ba471a	herein , the present review will give exhaustive details of extensive researches concerning the drug discovery and therapeutic options for covid-19 as well as some insightful discussions of the status of covid-19 .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	a defective - interfering ( di ) rna of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) was developed as a vector for expressing interferon - g ( ifn - g ) .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	the murine ifn - g gene was cloned into the di vector under the control of an mhv transcriptional promoter and transfected into mhv - infected cells .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	ifn - g was secreted into culture medium as early as 6 hr posttransfection and reached a peak level ( up to 180 u / ml ) at 12 hr posttransfection .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	the di - expressed ifn - g ( de - ifn - g ) exhibited an antiviral activity comparable to that of recombinant ifn - g and was blocked by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against ifn - g .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	treatment of macrophages with de - ifn - g selectively induced the expression of the cellular inducible nitric oxide synthase and the ifn - g - inducing factor ( igif ) but did not affect the amounts of the mhv receptor mrna .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	antiviral activity was detected only when cells were pretreated with ifn - g for 24 hr prior to infection ; no inhibition of virus replication was detected when cells were treated with ifn - g during or after infection .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	furthermore , addition of ifn - g together with mhv did not prevent infection , but appeared to prevent subsequent viral spread .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	mhv variants with different degrees of neurovirulence in mice had correspondingly different levels of sensitivities to ifn - g treatment in vitro , with the most virulent strain being most resistant to ifn - g treatment .
c71194d86904702bcd4952be0f977fb3b6b902c4	infection of susceptible mice with de - ifn - g - containing virus caused significantly milder disease , accompanied by more pronounced mononuclear cell infiltrates into the cns and less virus replication , than that caused by virus containing a control di vector .
4912ad7c9bda431dbfd0a75518abbe0a90db8edc	guided by a computational docking analysis , about 30 fda / ema - approved small molecule medicines were characterized on their inhibition of the sars - cov-2 main protease ( m pro ) .

d2cb42016d667584f72dcb518603e4e390f17ba6	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness in humans , which results in global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease currently .
d2cb42016d667584f72dcb518603e4e390f17ba6	this study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as covid-19 by using topic modeling .
d2cb42016d667584f72dcb518603e4e390f17ba6	: we extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the covid-19 open research dataset , which contains 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to march 20 , 2020 .
d2cb42016d667584f72dcb518603e4e390f17ba6	using latent dirichlet allocation modeling , we trained a topic model from the corpus , analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between covid-19 and other cov infections .
d2cb42016d667584f72dcb518603e4e390f17ba6	eight topics emerged overall : clinical characterization , pathogenesis research , therapeutics research , epidemiological study , virus transmission , vaccines research , virus diagnostics , and viral genomics .
d2cb42016d667584f72dcb518603e4e390f17ba6	it was observed that current covid-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization , epidemiological study , and virus transmission .
d2cb42016d667584f72dcb518603e4e390f17ba6	in contrast , topics about diagnostics , therapeutics , vaccines , genomics and pathogenesis only account for less than 10 % or even 4 % of all the covid-19 publications , much lower than those of other cov infections .
d2cb42016d667584f72dcb518603e4e390f17ba6	these results identified knowledge gaps in the area of covid-19 and offered directions for future research .
2a0a1bbb35b07b464af24878a2013b61b2bf301d	anti - hiv-1 drug design has been notably challenging due to the virus ' ability to mutate and develop immunity against commercially available drugs .
2a0a1bbb35b07b464af24878a2013b61b2bf301d	the aims of this project were to develop a series of fleximer base analogues that not only possess inherent flexibility that can remain active when faced with binding site mutations , but also target a non - canonical , highly conserved target : the nucleocapsid protein of hiv ( nc ) .
2a0a1bbb35b07b464af24878a2013b61b2bf301d	the compounds were predicted by computational studies not to function via zinc ejection , which would endow them with significant advantages over non - specific and thus toxic zinc - ejectors .
5206bc4b00611150b88f7e8bdb766e95638867c6	with the progress of covid-19 studies , it became evident that sars - cov-2 infection is often associated with thrombotic complications .
5206bc4b00611150b88f7e8bdb766e95638867c6	the goal of our present study was to evaluate which component of clot formation process including endothelial function , platelets aggregation and plasma coagulation , as well as endogenous fibrinolysis in patients with covid-19 correlates with the severity of the disease .
5206bc4b00611150b88f7e8bdb766e95638867c6	we prospectively included 58 patients with covid-19 and 47 healthy volunteers as a control group that we recruited before the pandemic started .
5206bc4b00611150b88f7e8bdb766e95638867c6	it turns out that plasma coagulation with subsequent platelet aggregation , but not endothelial function , correlates with the severity of the covid-19 .

66547ae18d15805ce94846813fe6fd755afe2bcf	we use the age - stratified covid-19 infection and death distributions from china ( more than 44,672 infectious as of february 11 , 2020 ) as an estimate for a study area 's infection and morbidity probabilities at each age group .
66547ae18d15805ce94846813fe6fd755afe2bcf	we then apply these probabilities into the actual age - stratified population to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak .
66547ae18d15805ce94846813fe6fd755afe2bcf	testing with different countries shows the predicted infectious skewing with the country 's median age and age stratification , as expected .
66547ae18d15805ce94846813fe6fd755afe2bcf	as expected , quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both exposed and infectious , and to ' flatten ' the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment .
66547ae18d15805ce94846813fe6fd755afe2bcf	these two estimates were used as a range to inform planning and response to the covid-19 threat .
5d4ab6eced8077ce100b402edf48a1d2e4a7081e	the in vitro production of red blood cells and platelets is a groundbreaking technology that can - when optimized - surrogate for donated blood cells , in total or in part .
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) is a lethal zoonosis caused by mers coronavirus ( mers - cov ) and poses a significant threat to public health worldwide .
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	therefore , a rapid , sensitive , and specific serologic test for detecting anti - mers - cov antibodies in both humans and animals is urgently needed for the successful management of this illness .
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	here , we evaluated various novel luciferase immunosorbent assays ( lisa ) based on nucleocapsid protein ( np ) as well as fragments derived from spike protein ( s ) including subunit 1 ( s1 ) , n terminal domain ( ntd ) , receptorbinding domain ( rbd ) and subunit 2 ( s2 ) of s for the detection of mers - cov - specific igg. fusion proteins , including nanoluciferase ( nluc ) and various fragments derived from the np or s protein of mers - cov , were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 t cells .
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	anti - mers - cov igg were further developed using cell lysates expressing various fusion proteins .
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	panels of human or animal samples infected with mers - cov were used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of various lisas in reference to a mers - cov rt - pcr , commercial s1-based
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	moreover , the s1- , rbd- , and np - lisa specifically recognized anti - mers - cov igg and did not cross - react with samples derived from other human cov ( oc43 , 229e , hku1 , nl63)-infected patients .
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	more importantly , these lisas proved their applicability and reliability for detecting anti - mers - cov igg in samples from camels , monkeys , and mice , among which the rbd - lisa exhibited excellent performance .
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	the results of this study suggest that the novel mers - cov rbd - and s1-lisas are highly effective platforms for the rapid and sensitive detection of anti - mers - cov igg in human and animal samples .
41e058c88e4a85497c84cec7b3e34bc0aeeaccae	these assays have the potential to be used as serologic tests for the management and control of mers - cov infection .
f60da34f23a757526b133716b9e79378b8cb0daa	coronavirus disease , first emerged in wuhan , rapidly spread all over the world since december 2019 .

36de1c611ceee1af5ceddea2e4041691829cf7ef	host cell membrane rearrangements induced by the hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) have been exclusively studied in vitro .
36de1c611ceee1af5ceddea2e4041691829cf7ef	these studies have shown that hcv induces double - membrane vesicles ( dmvs ) , which probably serve to separate replication sites from the cytoplasmic sensors of the innate immune response .
36de1c611ceee1af5ceddea2e4041691829cf7ef	we report for the first time the observation of hcv - induced membrane rearrangements in liver biopsy specimens from patients chronically infected with hcv .
36de1c611ceee1af5ceddea2e4041691829cf7ef	unlike observations performed in vitro , the membranous web detected in liver tissue seems essentially made of clusters of single - membrane vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and close to lipid droplets .
36de1c611ceee1af5ceddea2e4041691829cf7ef	this suggests that the dmvs could be a hallmark of laboratory - adapted hcv strains , possibly due to their ability to achieve a high level of replication .
36de1c611ceee1af5ceddea2e4041691829cf7ef	in any case , this constitutes the first report showing the differences in the membranous web established by hcv in vitro and in vivo .

65fb5bf263a77893c478b1f5e08a509aa98ab215	hsv - specific antibodysecreting cells were readily detected in the spleen , bone marrow , vagina / cervix , lumbosacral sensory ganglia , and spinal cord of previously - infected animals .
65fb5bf263a77893c478b1f5e08a509aa98ab215	memory b cells were detected primarily in the spleen and to a lesser extent in bone marrow but not in the genital tract or neural tissues suggesting that the hsvspecific antibody - secreting cells present at peripheral sites of hsv-2 infection represented persisting populations of plasma cells .
65fb5bf263a77893c478b1f5e08a509aa98ab215	the antibody produced by these cells isolated from neural tissues of infected animals was functionally relevant and included antibodies specific for hsv-2 glycoproteins and hsv-2 neutralizing antibodies .
65fb5bf263a77893c478b1f5e08a509aa98ab215	a vigorous ifn - c - secreting t cell response developed in the spleen as well as the sites of hsv-2 infection in the genital tract , lumbosacral ganglia and spinal cord following acute hsv-2 infection .
65fb5bf263a77893c478b1f5e08a509aa98ab215	unlike the persisting plasma cells , hsv - specific memory t cells were also detected in uterine tissue and cervicothoracic region of the spinal cord and at low levels in the cervicothoracic ganglia .
65fb5bf263a77893c478b1f5e08a509aa98ab215	both hsv - specific cd4 + and cd8 + resident memory cell subsets were maintained long - term in the genital tract and sensory ganglia / spinal cord following hsv-2 infection .
65fb5bf263a77893c478b1f5e08a509aa98ab215	together these data demonstrate the long - term maintenance of both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune response at the sites of hsv-2 latency and virus shedding and highlight the utility of the guinea pig infection

2f4699b35f4a23c23057e005ca55f0210755a8ab	the reason behind this frequent association with infections is an immunocompromised state of diabetic patient because uncontrolled hyperglycemia impairs overall immunity of diabetic patient via involvement of various mechanistic pathways that lead to the diabetic patient as immunocompromised .
2f4699b35f4a23c23057e005ca55f0210755a8ab	for instance , e. coli and klebsiella are the most common causative pathogens responsible for the development of urinary tract infections .

eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c	influenza - related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication , an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange , or to bacterial superinfection .
eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c	we sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia .
eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c	methods and findings : to distinguish among these possible causes of influenza - related death , we induced robust lung inflammation by exposing mice to an aerosolized bacterial lysate prior to challenge with live virus .
eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c	the treatment induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines il-6 and tnf in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 8-and 40-fold greater , respectively , than that caused by lethal influenza infection .
eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c	bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs was not observed .
eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c	when mice were repeatedly exposed to the bacterial lysate , as would be clinically desirable during an influenza epidemic , there was no tachyphylaxis of the induced viral resistance .
eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c	when the bacterial lysate was administered after the viral challenge , there was still some mortality benefit , and when ribavirin was added to the aerosolized bacterial lysate , host survival was synergistically improved ( 0 % vs 93.3 % survival , p,0.0001 ) .
eb83b27bafc37b40794c2c7cc1b921cbcdb4138c	together , these data indicate that innate immune resistance to influenza can be effectively stimulated , and suggest that ineffective rather than excessive inflammation is the major cause of mortality in influenza pneumonia .
474e12e66c6210b9b692365e7bd439a421012fb6	for the first time in worldwide literature , we provide scientific evidence that in covid-19 vasculitis a life - threatening escalation from type 2 t - helper immune response ( humoral immunity ) to type 3 hypersensitivity ( immune complex disease ) takes place .
474e12e66c6210b9b692365e7bd439a421012fb6	the subsequent deposition of immune complexes inside the vascular walls is supposed to induce a severe inflammatory state and a cytokine release syndrome , whose interleukin-6 is the key myokine , from the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ali / ards ) are vulnerable to ventilator - induced lung injury .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	although this syndrome affects the lung heterogeneously , mechanical ventilation is not guided by regional indicators of potential lung injury .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	we used electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) to estimate the extent of regional lung overdistension and atelectasis during mechanical ventilation .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	techniques for tidal breath detection , lung identification , and regional compliance estimation were combined with the graz consensus on eit lung imaging ( greit ) algorithm .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	nine ali / ards patients were monitored during stepwise increases and decreases in airway pressure .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	the duration and volume of tidal breaths erred on average by 0.2 s and 5 % , respectively .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	stepwise increases in pressure could reverse atelectasis in 17 % of the lung .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	at the highest pressures , 73 % of the lung became overdistended .
c40b8df3f113795275355b7b20952a2d7e013bd6	we recommend that the proposed approach be used in collaborative research of eit - guided ventilation strategies for ali / ards .

7d5677eb19a856141f598f3b2ebda2ca14e8cac0	the ftdrp assay correctly identified 26 diverse respiratory virus strains , 35 of 41 ( 85 % ) external quality assessment samples spiked with cultured virus and 232 of 263 ( 88 % )
7d5677eb19a856141f598f3b2ebda2ca14e8cac0	archived respiratory specimens that tested positive for respiratory viruses by in - house assays .
7d5677eb19a856141f598f3b2ebda2ca14e8cac0	of 308 prospectively tested respiratory specimens selected from children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness , 270 ( 87.7 % ) and 265 ( 86 % ) were positive by ftdrp and in - house assays for one or more viruses , respectively , with combined test results showing good concordance ( k = 0.812 , 95 % ci = 0.786 - 0.838 ) .
7d5677eb19a856141f598f3b2ebda2ca14e8cac0	individual ftdrp assays for adenovirus , respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus showed the lowest comparative sensitivities with in - house assays , with most discrepancies occurring with specimens containing low virus loads and failed to detect some rhinovirus strains , even when abundant .
7d5677eb19a856141f598f3b2ebda2ca14e8cac0	the ftdrp enterovirus and human bocavirus assays appeared to be more sensitive than the in - house assays with some specimens .
7d5677eb19a856141f598f3b2ebda2ca14e8cac0	with the exceptions noted above , most ftdrp assays performed comparably with in - house assays for most viruses while offering enhanced throughput and easy integration by laboratories using conventional real - time pcr instrumentation .
f64fbf23ee2ebcdfbc4c798721e3350646a7e45a	the new coronavirus disease threatens the lives of millions of people around the world , making it the largest health threat in recent times .
f64fbf23ee2ebcdfbc4c798721e3350646a7e45a	billions of people around the world are asked to adhere to strict shelter - in - place rules , finalised to slow down the spread of the virus .
f64fbf23ee2ebcdfbc4c798721e3350646a7e45a	specifically , our dependent variables are the level of understanding of official covid-19 pandemic response governmental informative panels , measured through comprehension questions , and the time spent on reading these rules .
f64fbf23ee2ebcdfbc4c798721e3350646a7e45a	these results suggest that norm - based interventions through fliers have very little impact on people 's reading and understanding of covid-19 pandemic response governmental rules .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	feline infectious peritonitis ( fip ) is a fatal inflammatory disease caused by fip virus infection .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	feline tumor necrosis factor ( ftnf)-alpha is closely involved in the aggravation of fip pathology .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	we previously described the preparation of neutralizing mouse anti - ftnf - alpha monoclonal antibody ( mab 2 - 4 ) and clarified its role in the clinical condition of cats with fip using in vitro systems .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	however , administration of mouse mab 2 - 4 to cat may lead to a production of feline anti - mouse antibodies .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	in the present study , we prepared a mouse - feline chimeric mab ( chimeric mab 2 - 4 ) by fusing the variable region of mouse mab 2 - 4 to the constant region of feline antibody .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	the chimeric mab 2 - 4 was confirmed to have ftnf - alpha neutralization activity .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	purified mouse mab 2 - 4 and chimeric mab 2 - 4 were repeatedly administered to cats , and the changes in the ability to induce feline anti - mouse antibody response were investigated .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	in the serum of cats treated with mouse mab 2 - 4 , feline anti - mouse antibody production was induced , and the ftnf - alpha neutralization effect of mouse mab 2 - 4 was reduced .
f6cb05b1b2874e3aabdc66876575cda7d7477d31	in contrast , in cats treated with chimeric mab 2 - 4 , the feline anti - mouse antibody response was decreased compared to that of mouse mab 2 - 4-treated cats .

829d1f27ec77edc8dfd2ec11c800e0621e9864a0	compared with p15 and p67 , p100 resulted in only mild clinical signs and intestinal lesions in piglets .
829d1f27ec77edc8dfd2ec11c800e0621e9864a0	the virus shedding in feces and viral antigens in intestinal tract were markedly reduced in p100-inoculated piglets .
829d1f27ec77edc8dfd2ec11c800e0621e9864a0	sequence analysis revealed that the virulent strain gds04 had four , one , six and eleven amino acid differences in membrane , nucleocapsid , spike and orf1ab proteins , respectively , from p100 .
829d1f27ec77edc8dfd2ec11c800e0621e9864a0	collectively , our research successfully prepared a peav attenuated variant which might serve as a live attenuated vaccine candidate against peav infection .
543910e626f6029190bc38d6cef2fb489c9b746e	the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease , covid-19 , has highlighted the threat that highly pathogenic coronaviruses have on global health security and the imminent need to design an effective vaccine for prevention purposes .
543910e626f6029190bc38d6cef2fb489c9b746e	although several attempts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus infections since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) in 2003 , there is no available licensed vaccine yet .
543910e626f6029190bc38d6cef2fb489c9b746e	a better understanding of previous coronavirus vaccine studies may help to design a vaccine for the newly emerged virus , sars - cov-2 , that may also cover other pathogenic coronaviruses as a potentially universal vaccine .
543910e626f6029190bc38d6cef2fb489c9b746e	in general , coronavirus spike protein is the major antigen for the vaccine design as it can induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity .
543910e626f6029190bc38d6cef2fb489c9b746e	by considering the high genetic similarity between sars - cov and sars - cov-2 , here , protective immunity against sars - cov spike subunit vaccine candidates in animal models has been reviewed to gain advances that can facilitate coronavirus vaccine development in the near future .

d5ca3cfe247aa245e54a837dd207e5d9d722f078	rapid and efficient detection of covid-19 reduces the rate of spreading this deadly disease and early treatment improve the recovery rate .
d5ca3cfe247aa245e54a837dd207e5d9d722f078	in this paper , we proposed a new framework to exploit powerful features extracted from the autoencoder and gray level co - occurence matrix ( glcm ) , combined with random forest algorithm for the efficient and fast detection of covid-19 using computed tomographic images .
3663dfeb3e6ff8eb76606ffa613909dd0cabf33e	as covid-19 makes its way around the globe , each nation must decide when and how to respond .
3663dfeb3e6ff8eb76606ffa613909dd0cabf33e	we used publicly available , country / territory level case reporting data to determine median seeding number , mean seeding time ( st ) , and several measures of mean doubling time ( dt ) for covid-19 .

2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	the potential role(s ) of cytokines in the reduction of infectious virus and persistent viral infection in the central nervous system was examined by determining the kinetics of cytokine mrna expression following infection with the neurotropic jhm strain of mouse hepatitis virus .
2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	mice were infected with an antibody escape variant which produces a nonlethal encephalomyelitis and compared to a clonal virus population which produces a fulminant fatal encephalomyelitis .
2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	infection with both viruses induced the accumulation of mrnas associated with th1-and th2-type cytokines , including ifn - g , il-4 , and il-10 .
2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	peak mrna accumulations were coincident with the clearance of virus and there was no obvious differences between lethally and nonlethally infected mice .
2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	tnf - a mrna was induced more rapidly in lethally infected mice compared to mice undergoing a nonfatal encephalomyelitis .
2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	rapid transient increases in the mrnas encoding il-12 , inos , il-1a , il-1b , and il-6 occurred following infection .
2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	nonlethal infections were associated with increased il-12 , il-1b , and earlier expression of il-6 , while lethal infections were associated with increased inos and il-1a mrna .
2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	however , neither the accumulation nor kinetics of induction provide evidence to distinguish lethal infections from nonlethal infections leading to a persistent infection .
2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4	accumulation of both th1 and th2 cytokines in the central nervous system of jhmvinfected mice is consistent with the participation of both cytokines and cell immune effectors during resolution of acute viral - induced encephalomyelitis .

f9c05a5c33ef91bbf61d086c882b60a5e6510b21	axl expression is potently induced by gm - csf expressed in the healthy and inflamed airway , and by type i interferon or tlr3 stimulation on human and mouse macrophages , indicating potential involvement of axl in apoptotic cell removal under inflammatory conditions .
f9c05a5c33ef91bbf61d086c882b60a5e6510b21	indeed , an absence of axl does not cause sterile inflammation in health , but leads to exaggerated lung inflammatory disease upon influenza infection .
f9c05a5c33ef91bbf61d086c882b60a5e6510b21	these data imply that axl allows specific identification of airway macrophages , and that its expression is critical for macrophage functional compartmentalisation in the airspaces or lung interstitium .

73753169415d3c4311df842bf6c121ca4e2ecbc2	however , covs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) , middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) , and the newest sars - cov-2 ( the causative agent of covid-19 ) lead to severe and deadly diseases with mortality rates ranging between~1 to 35 % depending on factors such as age and pre - existing conditions .
73753169415d3c4311df842bf6c121ca4e2ecbc2	despite continuous global health threats to humans , there are no approved vaccines or drugs targeting human covs , and the recent outbreak of covid-19 emphasizes an urgent need for therapeutic interventions .
73753169415d3c4311df842bf6c121ca4e2ecbc2	using computational and bioinformatics tools , here we present the feasibility of reported broad - spectrum rna polymerase inhibitors as anti - sars - cov-2 drugs targeting its main rna polymerase , suggesting that investigational and approved nucleoside rna polymerase inhibitors have potential as anti - sars - cov-2 drugs .
73753169415d3c4311df842bf6c121ca4e2ecbc2	however , we note that it is also possible for sars - cov-2 to evolve and acquire drug resistance mutations against these nucleoside inhibitors .

b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	esophageal malignancy is a disease with poor prognosis .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	the role of yeast as causative organisms of post - esophagectomy infections is poorly defined .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	consequently , the benefits of specific antifungal prophylactic therapy in improving patient outcome are unclear .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	therefore , this study aimed at investigating the incidence of yeast infections at the university medical center groningen among 565 post - esophagectomy patients between 1991 and 2017 .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	the results show that 7.3 % of the patients developed a yeast infection after esophageal resection with significantly increased incidence among patients suffering from diabetes mellitus .

b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	one - year survival was significantly lower for patients with a yeast infection , as well as diabetes mellitus and yeast - positive pleural effusion .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	we conclude that the incidence of yeast infections following esophagectomy is considerable , and that patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	furthermore , yeast infections are associated with higher complication rates and mortality .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	these observations encourage further prospective investigations on the possible benefits of antifungal prophylactic therapy for esophagectomy patients .

b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	moreover , patients who suffer from pneumonia show a seven - fold increase in mortality 7 .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	causative microorganisms for pulmonary infection usually belong to the oropharyngeal flora , as this is likely the result of cervical anastomosis leakage .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	risk factors for yeast infections can be split into host , pathogen and health - care associated aspects .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	in the former category , immune - compromising conditions , older age , malignancy , corticosteroid or cytotoxic therapy and neutropenia have all shown to increase the risk of invasive candida infections 8 .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	mechanically ventilated , critically ill patients suffer from colonization with candida species in 25 % of cases , whereas colonization occurs in 50 % of the patients suspected of ventilator - associated pneumonia 9 .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	nevertheless , pneumonia caused by candida is rare 10 .
b1363f16e00cf122c2855c3a3f544de6f36b0442	on the other hand , systemic yeast infections are associated with increased morbidity and mortality 9,11 .

20ec367d459abe3e88b7db18a359f087c37bd90e	enteroviruses are common human pathogens , and infections are particularly frequent in children .
20ec367d459abe3e88b7db18a359f087c37bd90e	severe infections can lead to a variety of diseases , including poliomyelitis , aseptic meningitis , myocarditis and neonatal sepsis .
20ec367d459abe3e88b7db18a359f087c37bd90e	enterovirus infections have also been implicated in asthmatic exacerbations and type 1 diabetes .
20ec367d459abe3e88b7db18a359f087c37bd90e	the large disease spectrum of the closely related enteroviruses may be partially , but not fully , explained by differences in tissue tropism .
20ec367d459abe3e88b7db18a359f087c37bd90e	the molecular mechanisms by which enteroviruses cause disease are poorly understood , but there is increasing evidence that the two enteroviral proteases , 2a pro and 3c pro , are important mediators of pathology .
20ec367d459abe3e88b7db18a359f087c37bd90e	these proteases perform the posttranslational proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein , but they also cleave several host - cell proteins in order to promote the production of new virus particles , as well as to evade the cellular antiviral immune responses .
20ec367d459abe3e88b7db18a359f087c37bd90e	enterovirus - associated processing of cellular proteins may also contribute to pathology , as elegantly demonstrated by the 2a pro -mediated cleavage of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes contributing to coxsackievirus - induced cardiomyopathy .
20ec367d459abe3e88b7db18a359f087c37bd90e	it is likely that improved tools to identify targets for these proteases will reveal additional host protein substrates that can be linked to specific enterovirus - associated diseases .

3c787e585321cc1d3d62aacb1c74713a4c77e9cc	hendra virus ( hev ) infection in humans is characterized by an influenza like illness , which may progress to pneumonia or encephalitis and lead to death .
3c787e585321cc1d3d62aacb1c74713a4c77e9cc	the pathogenesis of hev infection is poorly understood , and the lack of a mouse model has limited the opportunities for pathogenetic research .
3c787e585321cc1d3d62aacb1c74713a4c77e9cc	in this project we reassessed the role of mice as an animal model for hev infection and found that mice are susceptible to hev infection after intranasal exposure , with aged mice reliably developing encephalitic disease .
3c787e585321cc1d3d62aacb1c74713a4c77e9cc	we propose an anterograde route of neuroinvasion to the brain , possibly along olfactory nerves .
3c787e585321cc1d3d62aacb1c74713a4c77e9cc	this is supported by evidence for the development of encephalitis in the absence of viremia and the sequential distribution of viral antigen along pathways of olfaction in the brain of intranasally challenged animals .
3c787e585321cc1d3d62aacb1c74713a4c77e9cc	in our studies mice developed transient lower respiratory tract infection without progressing to viremia and systemic vasculitis that is common to other animal models .
3c787e585321cc1d3d62aacb1c74713a4c77e9cc	these studies report a new animal model of hev encephalitis that will allow more detailed studies of the neuropathogenesis of hev infection , particularly the mode of viral spread and possible sequestration within the central nervous system ; investigation of mechanisms that moderate the development of viremia and systemic disease ; and inform the development of improved treatment options for human patients .
93fed3054f2960f7f8ff0b846542fa34a6ed8f4a	the present manuscript proposes a heuristic global algorithm for predicting the covid-19 pandemic trend .
93fed3054f2960f7f8ff0b846542fa34a6ed8f4a	the proposed method utilizes a gaussian - function - based algorithm for estimating how the temporal evolution of the pandemic develops by predicting daily covid-19 deaths , for up to all rights reserved .
93fed3054f2960f7f8ff0b846542fa34a6ed8f4a	this dataset , the number of daily deaths in each country or region , encapsulates information about ( a ) the quality of the health system of each country or region , ( b ) the age profile of the country's / region 's population , and ( c ) environmental and other conditions .
93fed3054f2960f7f8ff0b846542fa34a6ed8f4a	the validity of the proposed heuristic global algorithm has been tested in the case of china ( at different temporal stages of the pandemic ) , a country where the disease trend seems to have run its course .
93fed3054f2960f7f8ff0b846542fa34a6ed8f4a	interpretation based on the predicted findings , the proposed algorithm seems to offer a robust and reliable method for revealing the sars - cov-2 temporal dynamics and disease trend , as such , can be a useful tool for the relevant authorities .

c7112417dffa124b3b7a11610898745a5e9e1adb	early and appropriate treatment with antimicrobials positively affects mortality and significantly reduces the time spent in both intensive care and the hospital .
c7112417dffa124b3b7a11610898745a5e9e1adb	drug choice is usually made on a " best guess " basis and instituted prior to receipt of appropriate blood , sputum , urine or drainage culture results .
c7112417dffa124b3b7a11610898745a5e9e1adb	bactericidal drugs should be given in combination , delivered by intravenous bolus and directed towards broad cover of all likely pathogens .
c7112417dffa124b3b7a11610898745a5e9e1adb	aminoglycoside / ureidopenicillin combinations are synergistic and widely used -often combined with metronidazole .
c7112417dffa124b3b7a11610898745a5e9e1adb	aminoglycoside toxicity can be reduced by giving the drug once daily ( od ) rather than by traditional multiple daily dosing ( mdd ) and by measuring peak and trough serum levels .

056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	covid-19 pandemic is a global crisis that threatens our way of life .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	as of april 29 , 2020 , covid-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives , with a global mortality rate of~7 % and recovery rate of~30 % .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the sars - cov2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	therefore , the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of covid-19 compared to different respiratory viruses ( ebola , h1n1 , mers - cov , and sars - cov ) , to determine unique anti - covid1 - 19 gene signature .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	we identified for the first time molecular pathways for heparin - binding , rage , mirna , and pla2 inhibitors , to be associated with sars - cov2 infection .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	the nrcam and saa2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response , and fgf1 and foxo1genes , which are associated with immune regulation , were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to covid-19 infection .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	moreover , several cytokines , most significantly the il-8 , il-6 , demonstrated key associations with covid-19 infection .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	interestingly , the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was serpinb1 .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	the ppi study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that covid-19 shares with other viral infections .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	the findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with rheumatoid arthritis , age - rage signaling system , malaria , hepatitis b , and influenza a were of high significance .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	we found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection , gene modulation of host antiviral responses , and go terms of both covid-19 and ebola are more similar compared to sars , h1n1 , and mers .
056725de694381c0cf67ee38d8df6b135991c96e	this work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against covid-19 .
9b637ea06505ae53b4c35208f6f66f5e88db9c0b	incubation of l cells with bound conjugates did not produce virus , although the conjugates were highly infectious in hela cells , containing natural poliovirus receptors .
9b637ea06505ae53b4c35208f6f66f5e88db9c0b	this suggests that the artificially bound virus was unable to penetrate the l cells and start replication .
9b637ea06505ae53b4c35208f6f66f5e88db9c0b	the possibility that binding of the virus to the natural receptor is required for efficient infection is discussed .
55322bfc591eeae6d68a9826baaebf6ec74234ca	we previously reported that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( il-1ra ) was involved in prrsv - induced immunosuppression during an early phase of infection .
55322bfc591eeae6d68a9826baaebf6ec74234ca	however , the exact mechanism associated with prrsv - induced il-1ra immunomodulation remains unknown .
55322bfc591eeae6d68a9826baaebf6ec74234ca	to explore the immunomodulatory properties of prrsv - induced il-1ra on porcine immune functions , monocyte - derived dendritic cells ( modc ) and leukocytes were cultured with type 2 prrsv , and the immunological role of il-1ra was assessed by addition of anti - porcine il-1ra
55322bfc591eeae6d68a9826baaebf6ec74234ca	the results demonstrated that prrsv - induced il-1ra reduced phagocytosis , surface expression of mhc ii ( sla - dr ) and cd86 , as well as downregulation of ifna and il1 gene expression in the modc culture system .
55322bfc591eeae6d68a9826baaebf6ec74234ca	interestingly , il-1ra secreted by the prrsv - infected modc also inhibited t lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation , but not ifn - γ production .

e31da87dbbe47d7d12f7fed16baba28ce74203fe	malaria is one of the major infectious diseases that remains a constant challenge to human being mainly due to the emergence of drug - resistant strains of parasite and also the availability of drugs , which are non - specific for their pharmacodynamic activity and known to be associated with multiple side effects .
e31da87dbbe47d7d12f7fed16baba28ce74203fe	the disease has acquired endemic proportions in tropical countries where the hygienic conditions are not satisfactory while the environmental conditions favor the proliferation of parasite and its transmission , particularly through the female anopheles .
e31da87dbbe47d7d12f7fed16baba28ce74203fe	it is obvious that to square up the problems , there is a need for designing and development of more effective drugs , which can combat the drug - resistant strains of the parasite .
e31da87dbbe47d7d12f7fed16baba28ce74203fe	molecular biology of the parasite and its homing into host cellular tropics provide multiple drug targets that could judiciously be considered for engineering and designing of new generation antimalarial drugs and also drug delivery systems .
e31da87dbbe47d7d12f7fed16baba28ce74203fe	though the recent reports document that against malaria parasite the vaccine could be developed , nevertheless , due to smart mutational change overs by the parasite , it is able to bypass the immune surveillance .
e31da87dbbe47d7d12f7fed16baba28ce74203fe	the developed vaccine therefore failed to assure absolute protection against the malarial infection .
e31da87dbbe47d7d12f7fed16baba28ce74203fe	in the conventional mode of treatment antimalarial drugs , the dose and dosage regimen that is followed at large crops up the contraindicative manifestations , and hence compromising the effective treatment .

883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	glycosyltransferases ( gts ) are bidirectional biocatalysts catalyzing the glycosylation of diverse molecules .
883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	however , the extensive applications of gts in glycosides formation are limited due to their requirements of expensive nucleotide diphosphate ( ndp)-sugars or ndp as the substrates .
883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	here , in an effort to characterize flexible gts for glycodiversification of natural products , we isolated a cdna , designated as ocugt1 from ornithogalum caudatum , which encoded a flavonoid gt that was able to catalyze the trans - glycosylation reactions , allowing the formation of glycosides without the additions of ndp - sugars or ndp .
883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	in addition , ocugt1 was observed to exhibit additional five types of functions , including classical sugar transfer reaction and three reversible reactions namely ndp - sugar synthesis , sugars exchange and aglycons exchange reactions , as well as enzymatic hydrolysis reaction , suggesting ocugt1 displays both glycosyltransferase and glycosidase activities .
883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	glycosylation is one of the most important modification reactions , in which sugar moieties are transferred to small molecular acceptors thereby leading to the formation of diverse glycosides with therapeutical potentials 1 .
883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	the enzyme - based glycosylations are mainly performed by two types of carbohydrate - active enzymes ( cazymes ) , glycosyltransferases ( gts , ec 2.4.x.y ) and glycosidases ( glycoside hydrolases ;
883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	glycosidases are naturally hydrolytic enzymes that normally cleave glycosidic bonds 3 .

883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	the majority of glycosylation reactions in nature are performed in gt - catalyzed fashion , in which the carbohydrate moieties from activated ndp - sugars are transferred to acceptor molecules 5 .
883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7	new glycosides can be generated by reversible sugar or aglycon exchange reactions catalyzed by gts with the addition of excess of ndp 6,7 .

95d99eb076499a6d5b171728505ac67466c00086	researches on methane adsorption mainly focus on the conditions of low pressure and water content .
95d99eb076499a6d5b171728505ac67466c00086	in this study , a hybrid gcmc - md simulation method is proposed to study methane adsorption characteristics under high pressure and water content in pores of different sizes .
95d99eb076499a6d5b171728505ac67466c00086	this method can obtain the bulk pressure of the system while ensuring the simultaneous movement of methane and water molecules , and has high efficiency and reliability .
95d99eb076499a6d5b171728505ac67466c00086	it is found that the existence of water does not change the morphology of excess isotherm , and the relative decrease of adsorption capacity due to the existence of water is not sensitive to temperature .
95d99eb076499a6d5b171728505ac67466c00086	in 3 nm pores , water molecules form water clusters and partially occupy wall adsorption sites , and the adsorption amount decreases linearly with increasing water saturation .
95d99eb076499a6d5b171728505ac67466c00086	in the 5 nm wide pore with 40 % water saturation , water films formed and methane adsorption is strongly suppressed .
95d99eb076499a6d5b171728505ac67466c00086	it is expected these findings could provide guidance for the evaluation of the amount of adsorbed methane with primary water .
f9ae601d80762953a9f04abd3f2c5a3c77fe1c9d	in clinical studies , however , standard dna injection alone generally induces low levels of transgene - specific immunity when compared to other vaccine approaches .
f9ae601d80762953a9f04abd3f2c5a3c77fe1c9d	in order to boost the immunogenicity of this platform , next - generation dna vaccines require additional techniques such as the administration of electroporation .
de0028f11f3f4fa017ea5dad0b84731e9c2e8a66	human infections with a novel coronavirus ( sars - cov-2 ) were first identified via syndromic surveillance in december of 2019 in wuhan china .
de0028f11f3f4fa017ea5dad0b84731e9c2e8a66	since identification , infections ( coronavirus disease-2019 ; covid-19 ) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally , with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of march 16 , 2020 .
de0028f11f3f4fa017ea5dad0b84731e9c2e8a66	effective public health interventions , including social distancing , contact tracing , and isolation / quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases .

7494e252329161ba1e3b07b7c0dc93e66d649c76	here , we investigated the methodological quality of srs on covid-19 , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) .
7494e252329161ba1e3b07b7c0dc93e66d649c76	online searches were performed to obtain srs on covid-19 , sars , and mers .
7494e252329161ba1e3b07b7c0dc93e66d649c76	the methodological quality of the included srs was assessed using the amstar-2 tool .

7494e252329161ba1e3b07b7c0dc93e66d649c76	srs on sars showed the optimum quality among the srs on the three diseases .
7494e252329161ba1e3b07b7c0dc93e66d649c76	subgroup analyses showed that the sr topic ( p < .001 ) , the involvement of a methodologist ( p < .001 ) , and funding support ( p = .046 ) were significantly associated with the methodological quality of the sr .
7494e252329161ba1e3b07b7c0dc93e66d649c76	according to the adherence scores , adherence to amstar-2 items sequentially decreased in srs on sars , mers , and covid-19 .
7494e252329161ba1e3b07b7c0dc93e66d649c76	the methodological quality of most srs on coronavirus outbreaks is unsatisfactory , and those on covid-19 have higher risks of poor quality , despite the rapid actions taken to conduct srs .
7494e252329161ba1e3b07b7c0dc93e66d649c76	the quality of srs should be improved in the future .

eb265b07935811bc052549f3780c9af843ecf45e	rna virus encodes a helicase essential for viral rna transcription and replication when the genome size is larger than 7 kb .
eb265b07935811bc052549f3780c9af843ecf45e	coronavirus ( cov ) has an exceptionally large rna genome ( ~30 kb ) and it encodes an essential replicase , the nonstructural protein 13 ( nsp13 ) , a member of superfamily 1 helicases .
eb265b07935811bc052549f3780c9af843ecf45e	thus , it is considered as an important drug target .
eb265b07935811bc052549f3780c9af843ecf45e	however , the high - resolution structure of cov nsp13 remained unavailable even until more than a decade after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) in 2003 , which hindered the structure - based drug design .
eb265b07935811bc052549f3780c9af843ecf45e	here , we describe protocols of deducing the crystal structure of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) helicase in detail , which include protein expression , purification , crystallization , enzymatic characterization , and structure determination .
eb265b07935811bc052549f3780c9af843ecf45e	with these methods , catalytically active recombinant mers - cov nsp13 protein can be prepared and crystallized and the crystal structure can be solved .
cf7e59688201ef2946c808e78e1ce2ac87e8a970	the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) , the cause of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic , like many other viruses , uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting ( prf ) to enable synthesis of multiple proteins from its compact genome .
cf7e59688201ef2946c808e78e1ce2ac87e8a970	in independent analyses , we evaluated the prf regions of all sars - cov-2 sequences available in genbank and from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data for variations .
cf7e59688201ef2946c808e78e1ce2ac87e8a970	of the 5,156 and 27,153 sequences analyzed , respectively , the prf regions were identical in 95.7 % and 97.2 % of isolates .
cf7e59688201ef2946c808e78e1ce2ac87e8a970	with the conversion of the g 13493 -c 13536 watson - crick pair to g - u , the sars - cov-2 prf closely resembles its counterpart in the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus .

1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	while the number of detected covid-19 infections are widely available , an understanding of the extent of undetected covid-19 cases is urgently needed for an effective tackling of the pandemic and as a guide to lifting the lockdown .
1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	the aim of this work is to estimate and predict the true number of covid-19 ( detected and undetected ) infections in india for short to medium forecast horizons .
1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	in particular , using publicly available covid-19 infection data upto 16th april 2020 , we predict the true number of infections in india during and upto the end of the formal lockdown period ( 21st april 2020 ) .
1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	the high death rate observed in most covid-19 hit countries is suspected to be a function of the undetected infections existing in the population .
1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	an estimate of the age weighted infection fatality rate ( ifr ) of the disease of 0.41 % , specifically calculated by taking into account the age structure of indian population , is already available in the literature .
1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	in addition , the recorded case fatality rate ( cfr= 0.70 % ) of kerala , the only state in india to report single digit new infections over the second week of april , is used as a second estimate of the ifr .
1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	in two consecutive fortnights during the lockdown , it was noted that the rise in detected infections has decreased by 2.7 times .
1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	for an ifr of 0.41 % , the rise in undetected infections decreased by 3.2 times and the predicted number of total infections in india is 3.14 lakhs .
1b84cd5aff283710027e9e9c7c0da21c97c856c3	while for an ifr of 0.70 % , the rise in undetected cases decreased by 3.3 times and the total number of infections predicted on 21st april is 1.75 lakhs .

56b2d409fd554bd2694eb7d938fd44fc282fd484	our data suggest that the observed potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity mainly depend on a combination of c - exndi affinity for hsv-1 g4s and their massive presence during infection .
56b2d409fd554bd2694eb7d938fd44fc282fd484	hsv-1 g4s may thus represent new effective antiviral targets : the fact that no current antiherpetic drug exploits them and their presence at the viral genome , responsible for both active and latent hsv infections , makes them particularly attracting .

56b2d409fd554bd2694eb7d938fd44fc282fd484	among herpesviruses , rna g4s have been implicated in the regulation of dna replication and translation of the epstein - barr virus 25 , 26 .
56b2d409fd554bd2694eb7d938fd44fc282fd484	we have shown that the herpes simplex virus 1 ( hsv-1 ) possesses several repeats of important g4-forming sequences , which could be stabilized by a g4 ligand with inhibition of viral dna replication 27 .
56b2d409fd554bd2694eb7d938fd44fc282fd484	the involvement of g4 structures in several human diseases propelled the development of small molecules directed against g4s 7 , 29 .

1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	a brain renin angiotensin system ( ras ) and its role in cardiovascular control and fluid homeostasis was at first controversial .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	but , the pursuit of brain ras has proven to be correct .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	in the course of accepting brain ras , high standards of proof attracted state of the art techniques in all the new developments of biolo1gy .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	consequently , brain ras is a robust concept that has enlightened neuroscience as well as cardiovascular physiology and is a model neuropeptide system .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	molecular biology confirmed the components of brain ras and their location in the brain .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	transgenic mice and rats bearing renin and extra copies of angiotensinogen genes revealed the importance of brain ras .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	cre - lox delivery in vectors has enabled pinpoint gene deletion of brain ras in discrete brain nuclei .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	the new concept of brain ras includes ace-2 , ang1 - 7 , and prorenin and mas receptors .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	angiotensin ii ( ang ii ) generated in the brain by brain renin has many neural effects .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	it activates behavioral effects by selective activation of ang ii receptor subtypes in different locations .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	it regulates sympathetic activity and baroreflexes and contributes to neurogenic hypertension .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	new findings implicate brain ras in a much wider range of neural effects .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	we review brain ras involvement in alzheimer 's disease , stroke memory , and learning alcoholism stress depression .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	there is growing evidence to consider developing treatment strategies for a variety of neurological disease states based on brain ras .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	brain renin and its effects have been established by a wide range of studies and techniques over the past 37 years .

1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	what began with its discovery in 1898 by tiegerstedt and bergman , who named it a kidney hormone [ 1 ] , was forgotten for 40 years .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	however , by 1971 , renin was recognized as an essential enzyme of the kidney renin angiotensin ( agt ) aldosterone system .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	so when detlev ganten [ 2 ] proposed that there was renin in the brain independent of kidney renin , it required high standards of proof .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	each time a new , more precise tool has become available , the role of brain renin angiotensin system ( ras ) has been revisited .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	about that time , angiotensin ii ( ang ii ) had become very interesting , physiologically and behaviorally [ 4 ] .
1c0fbcb3651324cdd2db3dc534c1b38ade220a5e	when ang ii is injected into the brain , it elicits a pressor response and , if water is available , a drinking response .

2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	as diagnostic tests such as reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction become more widely used , the relative importance of additional viruses ( such as parainfluenza , rhinoviruses , coronaviruses , and human metapneumovirus ) will likely increase .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	influenza virus should be considered as a cause of pneumonia during the winter months , especially during periods of peak activity .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia should also be suspected during the winter in patients with coryza , wheezing , low - grade fever , and patchy infiltrates , especially if negative for influenza on rapid testing .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	because clinical features and periods of activity for many viruses overlap , laboratory confirmation of influenza is recommended for cases involving seriously ill or institutionalized patients .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	viruses cause the largest proportion of cases of childhood pneumonia .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	in contrast , viral pneumonia is relatively uncommon during the reinfections during young adulthood .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	with advancing age and inevitable development of comorbidities , viruses once again may cause serious illness and pneumonia .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	although acute respiratory infection rates steadily decrease with advancing age , rates of hospitalization and death increase substantially in persons aged 160 years .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	immune dysregulation and waning cellular immune function may impair viral clearance , allowing spread of the virus to lower airways , with increased inflammation .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	studies of community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) in adults indicate a viral etiology in 1%-23 % of cases , with influenza virus being the most common virus [ 4 ] .
2f5bb8babcf9e40a337087b6925a3b5442bfbb40	although distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia is difficult on clinical grounds , there are helpful epidemiologic and clinical clues to alert physicians to the possibility of viral pneumonia .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate ( about 35 % ) since 2012 .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte - derived macrophages ( mdms ) and dendritic cells ( mddcs ) upon mers - cov infection .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	in this study , we assessed mers - cov replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mdms and immature and mature mddcs .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	immature mddcs and mdms were permissive for mers - cov infection , while mature mddcs were not , with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in mdms , but not in mddcs .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	to further evaluate the antiviral activity of well - defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells ( apcs ) , three compounds ( chloroquine , chlorpromazine and toremifine ) , each with broad - spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines , were evaluated in mdms and mddcs to determine their antiviral effect on mers - cov infection .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	while chloroquine was not active in these primary cells , chlorpromazine showed strong anti - mers - cov activity , but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	unlike in established cells , toremifene had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells , with high apparent cytotoxicity , also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	these results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells , in addition to established cell lines , before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for mers treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cytotoxicity in drug screen assays .
b7e0f3776f44e29508da3d6150d63790e7f38d9e	furthermore , these studies also highlight the role of apcs in stimulating a robust protective immune response to mers - cov infection .

aa254bedc7c082fdb618f4f7d37c5919daeb102e	the studies demonstrate that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing .
aa254bedc7c082fdb618f4f7d37c5919daeb102e	some of the aerosols desiccate to become droplet nuclei and remain adrift in the air currents .
aa254bedc7c082fdb618f4f7d37c5919daeb102e	however , no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume - related disease transmission , and the significance of the risk remains largely uncharacterized .
aa254bedc7c082fdb618f4f7d37c5919daeb102e	research suggests that toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	there has been a collaborative global effort to construct novel therapeutic and prophylactic approaches to sars - cov-2 management .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	although vaccine development is crucial , acute management of newly infected patients , especially those with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome , is a priority .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	herein we describe the rationale and potential of repurposing a dual plasmid , vigil ( pbi - shrna furin -gm - csf ) , now in phase iii cancer trials , for the treatment of and , in certain circumstances , enhancement of the immune response to sars - cov-2 .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ( sars - cov-2 ) is thought to have naturally evolved from two existing coronavirus strains ( l and s ) near wuhan , china .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	origin is presumed due to zoonotic transfer : the sars - cov-2 genome is 96.2 % homologous to the bat ratg13 coronavirus [ 1 ] .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	from 31 december 2019 to 4 april 2020 , 1,133,373 confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported worldwide resulting in 60,375 deaths .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	sars - cov-2 is emerging as a potentially greater morbidity and economic threat than the pandemic spanish flu which infected 500 million people worldwide and resulted in 50 million deaths .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	the viral reproductive number ( r 0 ) of sars cov-2 is above two compared with 1.8 for the spanish flu [ 2 ] .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	although more highly infectious , sars - cov-2 has resulted in far less mortality and is related to primarily elderly patients with medical comorbidities .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	the current reported mortality rate seems to be holding at approximately 2 % worldwide ( although age and country related ) , however , considering shifting denominators , the case fatality rate may be lower ; for example , 1.4 % of those with laboratory - confirmed disease [ 3 ] .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	since the pandemic of 1918 , influenza has become endemic but with use of vaccines the infection rate has been reduced and the case fatality rate has dropped significantly to 0.1 % .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	the sars - cov-2 pandemic , its rate of infectivity , related death , medical system overload and the consequent financial damage ( due to disease , fear and quarantine ) highlights the urgent need to develop new therapeutics as well as rapid response techniques to combat this and other novel pandemic virus outbreaks in the future .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	in particular , patients who recover from sars - cov-2 show evidence of an effective immune response to clear the infection and stop viral shedding within approximately 3 weeks [ 1 ] .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	this is particularly important since the virus generally does not persist and viral clearance is achievable , although feasibility of reinfection is unknown given pulmonary site of infectivity and propagation .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	efforts can be made to minimize the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , by enhancing the existing immune response , and slowing the viral propagation process .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	we will discuss repurposing vigil plasmid , which expresses gm - csf and decreases furin expression .
3729aa2a6c6397561d91516b9444df9e9522c32f	this approach inhibits multiples steps of viral propagation including viral entry , protein assembly and egress while gm - csf confers cellular immune antiviral and lung protection activity .

1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	emerging concepts in nucleolar biology include the nucleolar stress response ( nsr ) , whereby a series of cell insults have a special impact on the nucleolus .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	simple model organisms like the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae , easy to manipulate genetically , are useful in order to study nucleolar and rdna structure and their relationship with stress .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	only recently the myriad of processes that it is involved in have begun to be unraveled [ 4 ]
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	indeed , nutrition status , environmental cues and stress impinge on its size and shape [ 7 , 8 ] .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	in this review , we will concentrate on the structural changes of the nucleolus ( and the rdna ) of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	however , we will briefly describe some aspects of the nucleolar biology of metazoans that are connected to nucleolar biology of this simple yeast .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	importantly , we are mostly leaving out of this review the long - term effects that clastogenic and aneugenic stresses can cause on the rdna structure , which can also have a great and sustained impact on the nucleolar morphology .

1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	before we proceed into the next section , we introduce some concepts to better understand the processes presented here .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	on the other hand , longevity is defined as the potential maximum age that an individual of a particular species can attain , that is , the evolved length or duration of life for a species ; while life span is the length of life of an individual cell , organ or organism [ 12 ] .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	in budding yeast , aging has been traditionally divided into two different concepts .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	the first concept , replicative aging , stems from early works in the 50s , and is defined as the number of divisions an individual yeast cell undergoes before dying .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	the second concept , chronological aging , is the length of time a population of yeast cells remains viable in a nondividing state following nutrient deprivation [ 13 , 14 ] .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	the size and shape of the nucleolus are tightly related to the growth and proliferation status of the eukaryotic cell , and this is known since several decades ago [ 16 , 17 ] .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	tumour samples with a normal nucleolar number , size and shape correlates with a good prognostic , while an enlarged size and/or irregular shape correlates with a bad prognostic [ 22 ]
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	on the one hand , long - lived mutants of caenorhabditis elegans cells 2019 , 8 ,
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	779 3 of 22 ( e.g. , daf-2 ) , drosophila melanogaster ( under dietary restriction , rapamycin treatment or insulin - like mutants ) , mice ( under dietary restriction and irs1 long - lived mutants ) and human muscles biopsies ( under modest dietary restriction ) showed the small nucleoli phenotype [ 30 ] .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	on the other hand , cells from hutchinson - gilford progeria syndrome ( hgps ) patients and cells from aged healthy individuals showed the expanded nucleoli phenotype [ 31 ] .
1de4de4c1b8a4d3c18f20867febc8f4a2758dfd9	in yeast , nucleolar structure goes through two different phases during aging as well :
5bdaef2ec293cd710d8e9b409dae9ea463f89c52	coccidiosis is caused by intra - cellular infection of eimeria spp . , which goes through a complex life cycle in the intestinal mucosa of infected hosts .
5bdaef2ec293cd710d8e9b409dae9ea463f89c52	specific immunoglobulins ( igy ) could be produced in egg yolk by immunizing hens with specific antigens .
5bdaef2ec293cd710d8e9b409dae9ea463f89c52	the anti - gst - gam56 igy antibody was isolated and used to treat chickens infected with e. maxima oocysts .
5bdaef2ec293cd710d8e9b409dae9ea463f89c52	intramuscular injection of the antibodies provided minimal protection against parasite infection .
5bdaef2ec293cd710d8e9b409dae9ea463f89c52	however , oral dosing of the igy 3 or 5 d after oocyst inoculation significantly improved body weight gain , reduced oocyst output and intestinal lesion score were reduced at 3 or 5 d after oocyst challenging , compared to the untreated control group .
5bdaef2ec293cd710d8e9b409dae9ea463f89c52	our findings suggest that the igy to gam56 could be an effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent against e. maxima infection in chickens and should have a practical application value .

1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51	compared with temperate areas , the understanding of seasonal variations of influenza infections is lacking in subtropical and tropical regions .
1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51	insufficient information about viral activity increases the difficulty of forecasting the disease burden and thus hampers official preparation efforts .
1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51	here we identified potential meteorological factors that drove the seasonal variations in influenza infections in a subtropical city , hong kong .
1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51	we fitted the meteorological data and influenza mortality data from 2002 to 2009 in a susceptible - infected - recovered model .
1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51	from the results , air temperature was a common significant driver of seasonal patterns and cold temperature was associated with an increase in transmission intensity for most of the influenza epidemics .
1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51	except 2004 , the fitted models with significant meteorological factors could account for more than 10 % of the variance in additional to the null model .
1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51	rainfall was also found to be a significant driver of seasonal influenza , although results were less robust .
1dc4f757f425b080168840089f1f4d29bac75f51	the identified meteorological indicators could alert officials to take appropriate control measures for influenza epidemics , such as enhancing vaccination activities before cold seasons .
54c1ec13d3697c96a018ad42935295c9d0aefa55	effectively controlling infectious diseases requires quantitative comparisons of quarantine , infection control precautions , case identification and isolation , and immunization interventions .
54c1ec13d3697c96a018ad42935295c9d0aefa55	we used contact network epidemiology to predict the effect of various control policies for a mildly contagious disease , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome , and a moderately contagious disease , such as smallpox .
54c1ec13d3697c96a018ad42935295c9d0aefa55	the success of an intervention depends on the transmissibility of the disease and the contact pattern between persons within a community .
54c1ec13d3697c96a018ad42935295c9d0aefa55	the model predicts that use of face masks and general vaccination will only moderately affect the spread of mildly contagious diseases .
54c1ec13d3697c96a018ad42935295c9d0aefa55	in contrast , quarantine and ring vaccination can prevent the spread of a wide spectrum of diseases .

1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	type 1 interferon ( ifn ) continues to be the foundation for the current standard of care combination therapy for chronic hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection , yet the component interferon - stimulated genes ( isgs ) that mediate the antiviral actions of ifn are not fully defined .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	( ifitm1 ) is an isg product that suppresses early stage infection by a number of viruses through an unknown mechanism of action .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	moreover , the actions of ifitm1 on hcv infection are not fully elucidated .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	expression is induced early during ifn treatment of hepatocytes and accumulates at hepatic tight junctions in hcv - infected human patient liver during ifn therapy .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	additionally , we found that ifitm1 interacts with hcv coreceptors , including cd81 and occludin , to disrupt the process of viral entry .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	thus , ifitm1 is an anti - hcv isg whose actions impart control of hcv infection through interruption of viral coreceptor function .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	this study defines ifitm1 as an isg effector with action against hcv entry .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	design of therapy regimens to enhance ifitm1 expression should improve the virologic response among hcv patients undergoing treatment with type i ifn .

1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	1 hcv therapy has traditionally consisted of interferon ( ifn ) a and ribavirin .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	the newly approved protease inhibitors have improved sustained virologic response rates but still require ifn in combination for optimal results and reduced development of viral resistance .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	2 ifn treatment induces the expression of hundreds of interferon - stimulated genes ( isgs ) .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	isg products impart immunomodulatory , metabolic , apoptotic , and antiviral actions locally in the infected cell and systematically to bystander cells and immune effector cells , thus mediating antiviral states to suppress infection .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	while the antiviral actions of ifn against hcv are likely mediated by a combination of isgs acting on multiple viral and host targets , only a few isgs have so far been defined to have anti - hcv properties .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	[ 10 ] defining key isg effectors and their mechanisms of action against hcv will allow for treatment modification to enhance the antiviral activity of ifn - based therapy toward improved sustained virologic response while also generating potential targets for novel antiviral therapy applications .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	ifn triggers isg expression by binding the interferon a / b receptor and stimulating the jak / stat signaling cascade leading to formation of the isgf3 transcription factor complex and downstream induction of isgs .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	different ifn subtypes bind the receptor with varying affinities , leading to different isg induction profiles .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	we previously showed that the synthetic consensus ifn , a consensus of multiple ifn - a subtypes , has higher potency against hcv infection compared with naturally occurring ifn - a subtypes .
1b44dd1469da7fc742f1703d1a8c620d035d6d7b	13 high - throughput genomics analyses of hepatocytes treated with consensus ifn revealed that this increased potency is associated with the induction of a specific bioset of 86 isgs , including interferon - induced abbreviations : hcv , hepatitis c virus ; hiv , human immunodeficiency virus ; ifitm1 , interferon - induced transmembrane protein 1 ; ifn , interferon ; isg , interferon stimulated gene ; moi , multiplicity of infection ; qrt - pcr , quantitative reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction ; shrna , short hairpin rna .

b6894c1ae26e2f06f63d203361a3d98836b6a530	therefore , in this study , we performed a differential gene expression analysis , pathway enrichment analysis , and gene ontology on rnaseq data obtained from sars - cov-2 infected a549 cells .

b6894c1ae26e2f06f63d203361a3d98836b6a530	taken together , our results present a novel understanding of genes and corresponding pathways upon sars - cov-2 infection , and could facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers in the treatment of covid-19 .
793ca2cffe7b69dff2e3790e3a08460440492116	the role of cities in human infectious disease is well established , but less is known about how urban landscapes influence wildlife - pathogen interactions .
793ca2cffe7b69dff2e3790e3a08460440492116	continued rapid urbanization , together with risks posed by multi - host pathogens for humans and vulnerable wildlife populations , emphasize the need for future research on wildlife diseases in urban landscapes .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	despite massive investment in research on reservoirs of emerging pathogens , it remains difficult 34 to rapidly identify the wildlife origins of novel zoonotic viruses .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	here , we generate an ensemble of eight network - and trait - based 37 statistical models that predict mammal - virus associations , and we use model predictions to 38 develop a set of priority recommendations for sampling potential bat reservoirs and intermediate 39 hosts for sars - cov-2 and related betacoronaviruses .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	although over a dozen species of asian horseshoe 41 bats ( rhinolophus spp . ) are known to harbor sars - like coronaviruses , we find at least two thirds 42 of betacoronavirus reservoirs in this bat genus might still be undetected .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	our results should not be over - interpreted 46 as novel information about the plausibility or likelihood of sars - cov-2 's ultimate origin , but rather 47 these predictions could help guide sampling for novel potentially zoonotic viruses ; immunological 48 research to characterize key receptors ( e.g. , ace2 ) and identify mechanisms of viral tolerance ; 49 and experimental infections to quantify competence of suspected host species .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	coronaviruses are a diverse family of positive - sense , single - stranded rna viruses , found widely 53 in mammals and birds 1 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	they have a broad host range , a high mutation rate , and the largest 54 genomes of any rna viruses , but they have also evolved mechanisms for rna proofreading and 55 repair , which help to mitigate the deleterious effects of a high recombination rate acting over a 56 large genome 2 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	consequently , coronaviruses fit the profile of viruses with high zoonotic potential .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	there are seven human coronaviruses ( two in the genus alphacoronavirus and five in 58 betacoronavirus ) , of which three are highly pathogenic in humans : sars - cov , sars - cov-2 , and 59 mers -
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	60 61 our collective experience with both sars - cov and mers - cov illustrate the difficulty of tracing 62 specific animal hosts of emerging coronaviruses .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	during the 2002 - 2003 sars epidemic , sars-63 cov was traced to the masked palm civet ( paguma larvata ) 7 , but the ultimate origin remained 64 unknown for several years .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	horseshoe bats ( family rhinolophidae : rhinolophus ) were implicated 65 as reservoir hosts in 2005 , but their sars - like viruses were not identical to circulating human 66 strains 4 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	stronger evidence from 2017 placed the most likely evolutionary origin of sars - cov in 67 rhinolophus ferrumequinum or potentially r. sinicus 8 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	presently , there is even less certainty in the 68 origins of mers - cov , although spillover to humans occurs relatively often through contact with 69 dromedary camels ( camelus dromedarius ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	a virus with 100 % nucleotide identity in a ~200 base 70 pair region of the polymerase gene was detected in taphozous bats ( family emballonuridae ) in 71 saudi arabia 9 ; however , based on spike gene similarity , other sources treat hku4 virus from 72 tylonycteris bats ( family vespertilionidae ) in china as the closest - related bat virus 10,11 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	several 73 bat coronaviruses have shown close relation to mers - cov , with a surprisingly broad geographic 74 distribution from mexico to china 12,13,14,15 .

4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	although 78 the earliest cases were linked to a wildlife market , contact tracing was limited , and there has been 79 no definitive identification of the wildlife contact that resulted in spillover nor a true " index case .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	" 80 two bat viruses are closely related to sars - cov-2 : ratg13 bat cov from rhinolophus affinis 81
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	the 83 divergence time between these bat viruses and human sars - cov-2 has been estimated as 40 - 50 84 years 17 , suggesting that the main host(s ) involved in spillover remain unknown .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	sars - like betacoronaviruses 86 have been recently isolated from malayan pangolins ( manis javanica ) traded in wildlife 87 markets 18,19 , and these viruses have a very high amino acid identity to sars - cov-2 , but only show 88 a ~90 % nucleotide identity with sars - cov-2 or bat - cov ratg13 20 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	none of these host species 89 are universally accepted as the origin of sars - cov-2 or a progenitor virus , and a " better fit " wildlife 90 reservoir could likely still be identified .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	wildlife limit actionable inference about plausible reservoirs and intermediate hosts for 92 sars - cov-2 21 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	for example , machine learning approaches have generated candidate lists of 100 likely , but unsampled , primate reservoirs for zika virus , bat reservoirs for filoviruses , and avian 101 reservoirs for borrelia burgdorferi [ 26][27][28 ] .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	implementation of 104 multiple modeling approaches collaboratively and simultaneously could reduce redundancy and 105 apparent disagreement at the earliest stages of pathogen tracing and help advance modeling 106 work by addressing inter - model reliability , predictive accuracy , and the broader utility ( or 107 inefficacy ) of such models in zoonosis research .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	because sars - like coronaviruses ( subgenus sarbecovirus ) are only characterized from a small 110 number of bat species in publicly available data , current modeling methods are poorly tailored to 111 exactly infer their potential reservoir hosts .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	in this study , we instead conduct two predictive efforts 112 that may help guide the inevitable search for known and future zoonotic coronaviruses in wildlife : ( 1 ) broadly identifying bats and other mammals that may host any betacoronavirus and ( 2 ) 114 specifically identifying species with a high viral sharing probability with the two rhinolophus 115 species carrying the closest known wildlife relatives of sars - cov-2 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	to do this , we developed a 116 standardized dataset of mammal - virus associations by integrating a previously published 117 mammal - virus dataset 30 with a targeted scrape of all genbank accessions for coronaviridae and 118 their associated hosts .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	our final dataset spanned 710 host species and 359 virus genera , 119 including 107 mammal hosts of betacoronaviruses as well as hundreds of other ( non-120 coronavirus )
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	we integrated our host - virus data with a mammal phylogenetic 121 supertree 31 and over 60 ecological traits of bat species 27,32,33 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	we used these standardized data 122 to generate eight predictive models of host - virus associations , including four network - based 123 approaches , three trait - based approaches , and one hybrid approach using network and trait 124 information .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	network - based methods estimate a full set of " true " 131 unobserved host - virus interactions based on a recorded network of associations ( here , pairs of 132 host species and associated viral genera ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	these methods are increasingly popular as a way to 133 identify latent processes structuring ecological networks 34 - 36 , but they are often confounded by 134 sampling bias and can only make predictions for species within the observed network ( i.e. , those 135 that have available virus data ; in - sample prediction ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	these methods may be more likely 139 to recapitulate patterns in observed host - pathogen association data ( e.g. , geographic biases in 140 sampling , phylogenetic similarity in host morphology ) , but they more easily correct for sampling 141 bias and can predict host species without known viral associations ( out - of - sample prediction ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	these 154 include more half of bat species in the genus rhinolophus not currently known to be 155 betacoronavirus hosts ( 35 of 61 ) , compared to 16 known hosts in this genus .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	given known roles 156 of rhinolophids as hosts of sars - like coronaviruses , our results suggest that sars - like 157 coronavirus diversity could be undescribed for around two - thirds of the potential reservoir bat 158 species .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	network approaches proportionally upweight species with high observed viral 171 diversity , recapitulating sampling biases largely unrelated to coronaviruses ( e.g. , frequent 172 screening for rabies lyssaviruses in vampire bats , which have been sampled in a comparatively 173 limited capacity for coronaviruses 14 , [ 38][39][40 ] ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	out - of - sample 188 predictions were lower in the new world superfamily noctilionoidea , the emballonurids , and the 189 lasiurus genus , whereas the rhinolophus genus and the old world fruit bats ( pteropodidae ) both 190 had higher mean probabilities of betacoronavirus hosting ( supplemental table 1 ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	on the one hand , betacoronavirus sampling in 194 southeast asian bat taxa ( especially the genus rhinolophus ) may have a high success of viral 195 detection but may not improve existing bat sampling gaps 46 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	on the other hand , discovery of novel 196 betacoronaviruses in neotropical bats or old world fruit bats could significantly revise our 197 understanding of the bat - virus association network .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	such discoveries would be particularly 198 important for global health security , given the surprising identification of a mers - like virus in 199 mexican bats 14 and the likelihood that post - covid pandemic preparedness efforts will focus 200 disproportionately on asia despite the near - global presence of bat betacoronaviruses .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	major effects of sampling bias were apparent from the top-206 ranked species , which were primarily domestic animals or well - studied mesocarnivores ( ed 207 figure 2b ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	): in - sample , mean predictions primarily confirmed betacoronavirus 209 detection in the remaining laurasiatheria ( e.g. , ungulates , carnivores , pangolins , hedgehogs , 210 shrews ) , although nested clades of marine mammals ( i.e. , cetaceans ) were less likely to harbor 211 these viruses .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	although cetaceans are predicted to be susceptible to sars - cov-2 based on ace2 212 similarity with humans 47 , this result is expected given betacoronavirus epidemiology and their 213 predominance in terrestrial mammals .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	our dataset contained only 30 non - bat betacoronavirus 216 hosts , many of which were identified during sampling efforts following the first sars outbreak 7 . 217
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	given the unresolved origins of sars - cov-2 and significant motivation to identify other sars - like 222 coronaviruses and their reservoir hosts for pandemic preparedness 21 , we further explored our 223 only model that could generate out - of - sample predictions for all mammals 48 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	because rhinolophus affinis and r. malayanus host viruses 227 that are closely related to sars - cov-2 6,16 , we used their predicted sharing patterns to identify 228 possible reservoirs of sarbecoviruses .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	236 pangolins ( pholidota ) were disproportionately likely to share viruses with r. affinis and r. 237 malayanus ( supplemental figure 4 ) ; the sunda pangolin ( manis javanica ) and chinese pangolin 238 ( m. pentadactyla ) were in the top 20 predictions for both reservoir species
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	this result is promising given the much - discussed discovery of sars - like betacoronaviruses 240 in m. javanica 18 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	the viverridae were also disproportionately well - represented in the top 241 predictions ( supplemental figure 5 ) , most notably the masked palm civet ( paguma larvata ) , which 242 was identified as an intermediate host of sars - cov 49,50
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	our virus sharing 243 model thus captured historic patterns of betacoronavirus spillover and predicted cross - species 244 transmission from only the phylogeography of east asian mammals .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	moreover , these findings lend credibility to other predictions of sars - cov-2 sharing patterns and 253 host susceptibility .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	many of the model 's top predictions were mustelids ( i.e. , ferrets and weasels ) , 254 and the most likely viral sharing partner for both rhinolophus species was the hog badger 255 ( arctonyx collaris ; supplemental table 4 ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	taken together with reports of sars - cov-2 spread in 256 mink farms 53 , these results highlight the relatively unexplored potential for mustelids to serve as 257 betacoronavirus hosts and as models for infectivity studies 54 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	( supplemental figure 3 ) meshes with the observation of high binding of sars - cov-2 to ace2 260 receptors in cervid deer and primates 47 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	felids ( especially leopards ) also ranked relatively high in 261 our viral sharing predictions ( supplemental table 4 , supplemental figure 5 ) , which is of particular 262 interest given reports of sars - cov-2 susceptibility among cats 55 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	although some virological studies have incidentally tested specific hypotheses ( e.g. , 269 filovirus models and bat surveys 27,56 , henipavirus models and experimental infections 23,57 ) , model-270 based predictions are nearly never subject to systematic verification or post - hoc efforts to identify 271 and correct spurious results .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	greater dialogue between modelers and empiricists is necessary to 272 systematically confront the growing set of predicted host - virus associations with experimental 273 validation or field observation .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	, all highly 277 predicted bat species in our out - of - sample rankings , have been reported positive for 278 betacoronaviruses in the literature 43,58 ; however , resulting sequences were not annotated to 279 genus level in genbank .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	more recently , the release of 630 novel bat coronaviruses sequences 280 from china included four additional bat hosts ( hipposideros pomona , scotophilus kuhlii , myotis 281 pequinius , and m. horsfieldii )
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	whereas an automated approach was the 285 ideal method to systematically compile over 30,000 samples on the timescales commensurate 286 with ongoing efforts to trace sars - cov-2 in wildlife , we suggest this discrepancy highlights the 287 need for careful virological work downstream at every stage of the modeling process , including 288 the development of hybrid manual - automated data pipelines .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	limited longitudinal sampling of wild bats suggests 295 betacoronavirus detection is sporadic over time and space 58,63 , implying strong seasonality in 296 virus shedding pulses 64 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	carefully tailored spatial and temporal sampling efforts for priority taxa 297 identified here , within the rhinolophus genus or other high - prediction bat clades , will be key to 298 identifying the environmental drivers of betacoronavirus shedding from wild bats and possible 299 opportunities for contact between bats , intermediate hosts , and humans .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	general open access to viral 306 association records , including genbank accessions and the upcoming release of the usaid 307 predict program 's data , could answer open questions and allow updates to our sampling 308 prioritization ( including potentially modeling at subgenus level , with greater data availability ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	309 appropriately preserved museum specimens and historical collections , from diverse research 310 programs , also offer key opportunities to retrospectively screen samples from bats and other 311 mammals for betacoronaviruses and to enhance our understanding of complex host - virus 312 interactions 65 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	whole - genome sequencing through initiatives such as the bat1 k project 316 ( https://bat1k.ucd.ie ) would facilitate fundamental and applied insights into the immunological 317 pathways by which bats can harbor many virulent viruses without displaying disease 68,69 . 318 additionally , targeted sequencing efforts could also identify endogenized viral elements in bat 319 genomes , shedding light on the diversity of bat viruses and the evolution of bat immune 320 systems 70,71 . 321 322 to expedite such work , we have made our binary predictions of host - virus associations for all 323 eight models and all 1,000 + bat species publicly available ( supplementary file 1 ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	it is crucial that our predictions be interpreted as a set of hypotheses about potential host - virus 333 compatibility rather than strong evidence that a particular mammal species is a true reservoir for 334 betacoronaviruses .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	in particular , susceptibility is only one aspect of host competence 22,72 , which 335 encompasses the diverse genetic and immunological processes that mediate within - host 336 responses following exposure 73 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	sars - cov-2 in particular may have a broad host range 47 , given 337 hypothesized compatibility with the ace2 receptor in many mammal species , but this only adds 338 to the extreme caution with which any data should be used to implicate a potential wildlife 339 reservoir of the virus , given that rapid interpretation of inconclusive molecular evidence has likely 340 already generated spurious reservoir identifications 74,75 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	future efforts to isolate live virus from 341 wildlife or to experimentally show viral replication would more robustly test whether predicted 342 host species actually play a role in betacoronavirus maintenance in wildlife 57 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	, we note that our sampling prioritization scheme also 345 does not implicate any given mammal species in sars - cov-2 transmission to humans .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	the bat research community in particular has 348 expressed concern that negative framing of bats as the source of sars - cov-2 will impact public 349 and governmental attitudes toward bat conservation 76 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	in zoonotic virus research on bats , studies 350 often over - emphasize human disease risks 77 and rarely mention ecosystem services provided by 351 these animals 78 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	skewed communication can fuel negative responses against bats , including 352 indiscriminate culling ( i.e. , reduction of populations by selective slaughter ) 79 , which has already 353 occured in response to covid-19 even outside of asia ( where spillover occurred ) 80 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	instead , bat conservation programs and long - term 360 ecological studies are necessary to help researchers understand viral ecology and find 361 sustainable solutions for humans to live safely with wildlife .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	from another perspective , policy 362 solutions aimed at limiting human - animal contact could potentially prevent virus establishment 363 in novel species ( e.g. , as observed in mink farms 53 ) , especially in wildlife that may already face 364 conservation challenges ( e.g. , north american bats threatened by an emerging disease , white-365 nose syndrome 79,84 ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	substantial investments are already being planned to trace the wildlife origins of sars - cov-2 .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	however , the intermediate progenitor virus may never be isolated from samples 371 contemporaneous with spillover , and it may no longer be circulating in wildlife .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	mers - cov 372 circulates continuously in camels 85 and sars - cov persisted in civets long enough to seed 373 secondary outbreaks 49,50 , but the limited description of pangolin - cov symptoms suggests high 374 mortality , potentially indicating a more transient epizootic such as ebola die - offs in red river hogs 375
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	in lieu of concrete data , our study provides no additional evidence 376 implicating any particular species - or any particular pathway of spillover ( e.g. , wildlife trade , 377 consumption of hunted animals)-as more or less likely .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	although policies that focus 380 on particular potential reservoir species or target human - wildlife contact could reduce future 381 spillovers , they will have a negligible bearing on the ongoing pandemic , as sars - cov-2 is highly 382 transmissible within humans ( e.g. , unlike mers - cov or other zoonoses that are sustained in 383 people by constant reintroduction ) .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	sars - cov-2 is likely to remain circulating in human 384 populations at least until a vaccine is developed ( if not much longer , given current challenges to 385 vaccine production , allocation , governance , and uptake ) , regardless of immediate actions 386 regarding wildlife .
4806b77bcfb79ddc9388aa2a9049529c2b584fef	covid-19 response must be informed by the best consensus evidence 387 available and prioritize solutions that address immediate reduction of transmission through 388 public health and policy channels .

9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	in this study we developed an algorithm to effectively analyze large - scale oil spill areas in sar images by focusing on optimizing the input layer to artificial neural network ( ann ) through removal the factor of lowering the accuracy .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	highly accurate pixel - based data processing was conducted through false or un - detection element reduction by normalizing the image or applying a non - local ( nl ) means filter and median filter to the input neurons for ann .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	in addition , the standard deviation of co - polarized phase difference ( cpd ) was used to reduce false detection from the look - alike with weak damping effect .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	the algorithm was validated using terrasar - x images of an oil spill caused by stranded oil tanker volganefti-139 in the kerch strait in 2007 .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	however , the methods suffer from a false detection problem due to look - alikes that produce a similar signal with oil spill ; for example , low - wind zones ( wind speed < 3 m / s ) , internal wave , ship wake and biogenic films [ 24 , 25 ] .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	however , it can be difficult ( i ) to define standard shapes for oil spills owing to the high fluidity or ( ii ) to distinguish the shape of oil spills from that of look - alikes ( e.g. , ship wake and biogenic films ) .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	the second is that the machine learning method is highly dependent on the input layer , especially , there is a problem that false detection and non - detection due to the noise of the input data is greatly increased when using the pixel - based ann algorithm .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	four polarized images ( hh , hv , vv , and vh ) can be obtained from sar sensors according to the transmitting and receiving modes of the radar signal .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	the phase difference between vv - and hh - polarized images can be represented by the co - polarized phase difference ( cpd ) , and cpd has a higher correlation with oil spill than it does with look - alikes , which have a weak - damping effect [ 32 ] .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	in addition , the coherence between vv - and hh - polarized images are very low in oil spill areas , whereas it is very high in oil - free areas , which is close to 1 .

9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	four maps were extracted from the hh and vv single - look complex ( slc ) images , which include the intensity , texture , coherence and phase texture maps , and then oil - covered areas in the maps were emphasized through multi - looking and the non - local ( nl ) means and median filtering .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	in addition , we compare between the results from the presence and absence of the phase information , because most sar images are acquired from the single - polarization .
9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa	the proposed method has the advantage that it can estimate the oil spill probability at the pixel unit , and hence it would be effectively used for large - scale oil spill accidents .

c6b0daaa78cd0437943c7d74214defdc73aeb728	a retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed .
c6b0daaa78cd0437943c7d74214defdc73aeb728	viral testing results , dlb indication , dlb findings , and perioperative complications were compared .
c6b0daaa78cd0437943c7d74214defdc73aeb728	those with positive rvp were less likely to have an anatomic airway abnormality ( p = 0.0250 ) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections ( p = 0.0464 ) .
c6b0daaa78cd0437943c7d74214defdc73aeb728	the most common reason for dlb was to assess for structural airway abnormality .

b6b49bfba83105940015b7b8280db74ce480c65c	despite asthma being the most common chronic childhood ailment , there is still much to learn about the disease .
b6b49bfba83105940015b7b8280db74ce480c65c	early childhood infections with well - known or emerging viruses can lay the pathophysiologic framework for asthma development and exacerbation later in life , which may be due partly to alteration of the airway microbiome .
b6b49bfba83105940015b7b8280db74ce480c65c	once asthma is established , acute exacerbations are usually associated with infections with respiratory viruses , such as rhinoviruses ( rvs ) .

a03298211c385b7bd1d1ebdc98b1cc69efe7f54d	to systematically identify novel , essential host genes affecting bmv rna replication , we tested a collection of , 900 yeast strains , each with a single essential gene promoter replaced by a doxycycline - repressible promoter , allowing repression of gene expression by adding doxycycline to the growth medium .
a03298211c385b7bd1d1ebdc98b1cc69efe7f54d	using this strain array of , 81 % of essential yeast genes , we identified 24 essential host genes whose depleted expression reproducibly inhibited or enhanced bmv rna replication .
a03298211c385b7bd1d1ebdc98b1cc69efe7f54d	investigating the diverse functions of these newly identified essential host genes should advance our understanding of bmv - host interactions and normal cellular pathways , and suggest new modes of virus control .
eae2836920703308785197c3ef49af9f10fcdb16	after three years of excessive confidence , overoptimistic expectations and performance of 15 to 20,000 renal denervation procedures in europe , the failure of a single well - designed us trial - symplicity htn-3-to meet its primary efficacy endpoint has cast doubt on renal denervation as a whole .
eae2836920703308785197c3ef49af9f10fcdb16	the use of a sound methodology , including randomisation and blinded endpoint assessment was enough to see the typical 25 - 30 mmhg systolic blood pressure decrease observed after renal denervation melt down to less than 3 mmhg , the rest being likely explained by hawthorne and placebo effects , attenuation of white coat effect , regression to the mean and other physician and patient - related biases .
eae2836920703308785197c3ef49af9f10fcdb16	the modest blood pressure benefit directly assignable to renal denervation should be balanced with unresolved safety issues , such as potentially increased risk of renal artery stenosis after the procedure ( more than ten cases reported up to now , most of them in 2014 ) , unclear long - term impact on renal function and lack of morbidity - mortality data .
eae2836920703308785197c3ef49af9f10fcdb16	accordingly , there is no doubt that renal denervation is not ready for clinical use .
eae2836920703308785197c3ef49af9f10fcdb16	still , renal denervation is supported by a strong rationale and is occasionally followed by major blood pressure responses in at - risk patients who may otherwise have remained uncontrolled .
eae2836920703308785197c3ef49af9f10fcdb16	upcoming research programmes should focus on identification of those few patients with truly resistant hypertension who may derive a substantial benefit from the technique , within the context of well - designed randomised trials and independent registries .
eae2836920703308785197c3ef49af9f10fcdb16	while electrical stimulation of baroreceptors and other interventional treatments of hypertension are already " knocking at the door " , the premature and uncontrolled dissemination of renal denervation should remain an example of what should not be done , and trigger radical changes in evaluation processes of new devices by national and european health authorities .

7ede4d596a703d69f8093f2df4b78a847be0cee9	in this article , we present data from the monthly pandemic food and stigma survey ( pfss ) , a nationwide representative sample of adults in the united states designed to identify how the pandemic is affecting concerns about food and the environment .
7ede4d596a703d69f8093f2df4b78a847be0cee9	our analysis suggests that the public 's concern about contracting covid-19 has been high ; however , infection with covid-19 was not the only concern .
7ede4d596a703d69f8093f2df4b78a847be0cee9	in general , we find that people whose food security has been threatened by covid-19 remain concerned about relaxation of environmental regulations , and those most inclined to take steps to reduce spread of the virus , such as wearing masks and social distancing , are more concerned about relaxed regulations than those less willing to take mitigating actions .

eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	the expected high frequency of hla - dr2 in patients with demyelinating disease was matched by preselection of normal controls with this antigen ( dr2 + ) ; the remaining individuals were classified as hla - dr2 negative / dr3 positive ( dr3 + ) or hla - dr2 and 3 negative
eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	cases were compared with controls , collectively and in analyses restricted to each genetic group ; these comparisons were repeated considering the three categories of patients with demyelination and two control populations separately .
eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	patients with demyelinating disease had rubella and measles at a later age and reported mumps infection more frequently than controls .
eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	age of typhoid vaccination and duration of exposure to domestic dogs was higher in all cases than controls .
eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	age of measles and mumps , but not rubella , was higher in dr2 + cases than controls ; but differences were not observed in the other genetic groups .

eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	higher adenovirus and varicella zoster antibody titres were present in dr2/3-patients with demyelination and other neurological diseases compared with normal controls .
eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	overall , older age of infection and higher antibody titres were observed more often in patients with optic neuritis , in particular dr2 + cases , than other individuals with demyelination or controls .
eaad53543d7aad4107aab05298dba5805c0c588e	our serological results are consistent with the presence of abnormal hla - immunological reactivity in patients with ms but can not be explained only by an effect of dr type itself ; age at which susceptible individuals develop some common childhood infections may also influence the subsequent development of the disease .
56d60ee55534af0eaa4a2b10423b60d63faf1182	rhinosinusitis ( rs ) is a heterogeneous group of diseases .
56d60ee55534af0eaa4a2b10423b60d63faf1182	in addition , rs is not well - understood , and little is known about the etiology and pathophysiology .
56d60ee55534af0eaa4a2b10423b60d63faf1182	rs is commonly classified into acute and chronic rs based on symptom duration .
56d60ee55534af0eaa4a2b10423b60d63faf1182	in acute rs , an inflammatory reaction initiated by a viral infection characterizes most uncomplicated , mild to moderate cases .
56d60ee55534af0eaa4a2b10423b60d63faf1182	therefore , the first line of treatment for these cases are intranasal steroids and not antibiotics .
56d60ee55534af0eaa4a2b10423b60d63faf1182	in severe and complicated cases , antibiotics combined with topical steroids remain the treatment of choice .
56d60ee55534af0eaa4a2b10423b60d63faf1182	on the other hand , chronic rs is actually subdivided into two distinct entities ( chronic rhinosinusitis with and without polyps ) , as growing evidence indicates that these entities have specific inflammatory pathways and cytokine profiles .

9bf0b6a8f2fc8bd4b3b80299ea9c7318340b1e4d	we have shown by n - glycanase digestion that lcmv strain arm-4 bears five oligosaccharides on gp-1 and two on gp-2 .
9bf0b6a8f2fc8bd4b3b80299ea9c7318340b1e4d	we demonstrate that addition of high mannose precursor oligosaccharides is necessary for transport and cleavage of the viral gp - c glycoprotein .
9bf0b6a8f2fc8bd4b3b80299ea9c7318340b1e4d	moreover , in the presence of tunicamycin which inhibits en bloc addition of these mannose - rich side chains , virus budding was substantially decreased and infectious virions were reduced by more than looo - fold in the supernatant medium .
9bf0b6a8f2fc8bd4b3b80299ea9c7318340b1e4d	finally , by temperature block experiments we have determined that maturation of gp - c oligosaccharides to an endoglycosidase h resistant form precedes cleavage to gp-1 and gp-2 .

137d89bbd0e0e59ce27516606a6a34fee3125501	the framework is made up of two pairs of linked concepts :
137d89bbd0e0e59ce27516606a6a34fee3125501	this framework allows the clear formulation of key questions for covid-19 : factors in the labor process itself that make people more or less susceptible ; broader socio - economic and biophysical determinants of susceptibility ; factors that make farm households , food enterprises and value chains more vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic ; and aspects of covid-19 responses by governments and the private sector that might increase vulnerability .
137d89bbd0e0e59ce27516606a6a34fee3125501	brief examples of susceptibility of value chain operations and of their vulnerability to covid-19 lockdown measures are given .
137d89bbd0e0e59ce27516606a6a34fee3125501	the full impacts of covid-19 on the global south are yet to be seen , and are still hard to predict in either scale or nature .
137d89bbd0e0e59ce27516606a6a34fee3125501	yet it is clear that those effects will include impacts on both smallholder and commercial farming and on other links in agricultural value chains .
137d89bbd0e0e59ce27516606a6a34fee3125501	at the same time , news from countries of the north suggests another causal relationship , that particular sorts of enterprises within agricultural value chains , most prominently meat - processing plants , are implicated in localized covid-19 outbreaks , some of them extremely serious ( reuben 2020 citing cases in uk , germany , france , spain and the us ) .
137d89bbd0e0e59ce27516606a6a34fee3125501	the great majority of reports on impacts already experienced in different countries of the south still concern the indirect impacts of lockdowns and travel bans , or of economic trends in more industrialized countries .

fa842dec6fdf7e682dfafd7536ede827fd02466d	many blood donation services around the globe maintain large archives of serum and/or plasma specimens of blood donations which could potentially be used for serologic surveillance and risk assessment of influenza .
fa842dec6fdf7e682dfafd7536ede827fd02466d	harnessing this potential requires robust evidence that the outcomes of influenza serology in plasma , which is rarely used , is consistent with that in serum , which is the conventional choice of specimens for influenza serology .
fa842dec6fdf7e682dfafd7536ede827fd02466d	we harvested edta - plasma specimens from the blood donation archives of hong kong red cross transfusion services , where edta is the type of anticoagulant used for plasma collection , compared their antibody titers and responses to that in serum .
fa842dec6fdf7e682dfafd7536ede827fd02466d	our results showed that antibody titers in 609 matched serum / edta - plasma specimens ( i.e. obtained from the same donor at the same time ) had good agreement inferred by intraclass correlation coefficient , the value of which was 0.82 ( 95 % ci : 0.77 - 0.86 ) for hemagglutination inhibition assay and 0.95 ( 95 % ci : 0.93 - 0.96 ) for microneutralization assay ; seroconversion rates ( based on hemagglutination inhibition titers ) during the 2010 and 2011 influenza seasons in hong kong inferred from paired edta - plasma were similar to that inferred from paired sera .
fa842dec6fdf7e682dfafd7536ede827fd02466d	our study provided the proof - of - concept that blood donation archives could be leveraged as a valuable source of longitudinal blood specimens for the surveillance , control and risk assessment of both pandemic and seasonal influenza .
f2d489e9d9317500bf6210b4ecdb7966f117556f	using gsea , we compared our previous transcriptome analysis of neurons injured by glutamate and treated with the arb candesartan ( gse67036 ) with transcriptional signatures from sars - cov-2 infected primary human bronchial epithelial cells ( nhbe ) and lung postmortem ( gse147507 ) , pbmc and balf samples ( cra002390 ) from covid-19 patients .

30bf8179a7859d1b72b82985e1f44b54f92d1f3d	restrictions of this kind were important in the response to epidemics of sars ( 2003 ) , h1n1 influenza ( 2009 ) , and ebola ( 2014 ) .
30bf8179a7859d1b72b82985e1f44b54f92d1f3d	the imposition of a cordon sanitaire to control the 2014 west african ebola outbreak , for example , is argued to have led to a higher - than - expected number of cases in the quarantined area .
30bf8179a7859d1b72b82985e1f44b54f92d1f3d	to determine when mobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic , we use a model of disease transmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected communities .
30bf8179a7859d1b72b82985e1f44b54f92d1f3d	by contrast , the imposition of a cordon sanitaire around the high - risk community reduces the number of secondary infections in the low - risk community but increases the overall epidemic size .
30bf8179a7859d1b72b82985e1f44b54f92d1f3d	the degree to which mobility restrictions increase or decrease the overall epidemic size depends on the level of risk in each community and the characteristics of the disease .
f5357b0f83fd122f2d404f2829f705d6c40d8ef6	our understanding of these fascinating viruses thus remains incomplete but it seemed appropriate at this moment to look back and reflect on our progress and most important questions that still puzzle us .
f5357b0f83fd122f2d404f2829f705d6c40d8ef6	it is also essential of being careful about concepts that seem so well established , but could still be better validated using new approaches .

e2d694ac46fe36cd29778136da49493549d24fa5	after sars - cov-2 infection is essential in determining the seroepidemiology of the virus and the potential role of antibody in disease .
e2d694ac46fe36cd29778136da49493549d24fa5	the detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward ; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable .
e2d694ac46fe36cd29778136da49493549d24fa5	we hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect .
e2d694ac46fe36cd29778136da49493549d24fa5	we systemically developed an elisa assay , optimising different antigens and amplification steps , in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic sars - cov-2-infected subjects .
e2d694ac46fe36cd29778136da49493549d24fa5	using trimeric spike glycoprotein , rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses .
e2d694ac46fe36cd29778136da49493549d24fa5	anti - spike , but not nucleocapsid , igg , iga and igm antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non - hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals .
e2d694ac46fe36cd29778136da49493549d24fa5	antibody responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting .
e2d694ac46fe36cd29778136da49493549d24fa5	detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after sars - cov-2 infection .

9b1b665e6ea27f485898427a23df51c18ed0ebb7	in 2007 , a novel bunyavirus was found in henan province , china and named fever , thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia syndrome virus ( ftlsv ) ; since then , ftlsv has been found in ticks and animals in many chinese provinces .
9b1b665e6ea27f485898427a23df51c18ed0ebb7	determining the historical spread of ftlsv could help curtail its spread and prevent future movement of this virus .
9b1b665e6ea27f485898427a23df51c18ed0ebb7	analysis based on the ftlsv l segment suggests that the virus likely originated somewhere in huaiyangshan circa 1790 ( 95 % highest probability density interval : 1756 - 1817 ) and began spreading around 1806 ( 95 % highest probability density interval : 1773 - 1834 ) .
9b1b665e6ea27f485898427a23df51c18ed0ebb7	analysis also indicates that when ftlsv arrived in jiangsu province from huaiyangshan , jiangsu province became another source for the spread of the disease .
9b1b665e6ea27f485898427a23df51c18ed0ebb7	the speed of ftlsv movement has increased in recent decades , likely facilitated by modern human activity and ecosystem changes .
9b1b665e6ea27f485898427a23df51c18ed0ebb7	in addition , evidence of rna segment reassortment was found in ftlsv ; purifying selection appears to have been the dominant force in the evolution of this virus .
9b1b665e6ea27f485898427a23df51c18ed0ebb7	these results provide new insights into the origin and spread of ftlsv in china , and provide a foundation for future virological surveillance and control .

d9d6c6f034dd3114696c0811a672bbd5c9c9dc18	the publication of this second theme issue attests to the frequency , visibility , and attention that these diseases are receiving .
d9d6c6f034dd3114696c0811a672bbd5c9c9dc18	a year ago , we commented on several prevailing factors worldwide that facilitate the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases , among them a growing human population , increased interaction between species , global climate changes , and rapid movement of people and animals ( 1 ) .
d9d6c6f034dd3114696c0811a672bbd5c9c9dc18	these factors continue to exert their influence , and we continue to see a plethora of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases .

e40e7e5f470154dd5293cbe6fd09c12792b5cf72	beyond explaining some of the current pitfalls , this paper will serve as a more general caveat regarding the interpretation of data in the context of the sars - cov-2 pandemic .
e40e7e5f470154dd5293cbe6fd09c12792b5cf72	in the public debate , one can encounter at least three concepts that measure the deadliness of sars - cov-2 : the case fatality rate ( cfr ) , the infection fatality rate ( ifr ) and the mortality rate ( mr ) .
e40e7e5f470154dd5293cbe6fd09c12792b5cf72	unfortunately , these three concepts are sometimes used interchangeably , which creates confusion as they differ from each other by defi nition .

4897437487fa9131e6d9006bd11d84f40327d0b1	while much of the current discussion is correctly focused on learners ' material realities and how covid-19 is exacerbating those inequalities , largely overlooked is how the core activity of the education experience - learning - is managed , simultaneously , at the macro - level of the state , and the micro - levels of the individual learner .
6457c104a7b0b025f7536a24db9a40f663e5f469	as the global covid-19 pandemic continues to escalate , no effective treatment has yet been developed for the severe respiratory complications of this disease .
6457c104a7b0b025f7536a24db9a40f663e5f469	this may be due in large part to the unclear immunopathological basis for the development of immune dysregulation and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) in severe and critical patients .
6457c104a7b0b025f7536a24db9a40f663e5f469	specifically , it remains unknown whether the immunological features of the disease that have been identified so far are compartment - specific responses or general features of covid-19 .

60ee0e6f4ff94dce64daa2bea069b1f163562380	vaccine efficacy was not significantly affected by the method of virus inactivation , the number of immunisations or the age of the mouse at immunisation .
60ee0e6f4ff94dce64daa2bea069b1f163562380	vaccination conferred better protection than previous type 2 genital infection ; this may be a consequence of a higher antigenic dose , more acceptable antigenic presentation or to a perversion of the immune response in a latently infected animal to homologous virus challenge .
60ee0e6f4ff94dce64daa2bea069b1f163562380	the feasibility of immunisation against herpes simplex infections was first demonstrated in rabbits by lipo ~ utz ( 9 ) .
60ee0e6f4ff94dce64daa2bea069b1f163562380	these early studies also provided evidence of the contribution of cell - mediated factors on host immunity and even hinted at possible antigenic distinctiveness between herpes simplex virus strains .
60ee0e6f4ff94dce64daa2bea069b1f163562380	more recently , successful immunisation against type 1 herpes virus has been demonstrated with live vaccine in mice ( 17 ) and with inactivated vaccine in mice and in rabbits ( 2 , 8) .

1c5876f59b8eb7da373512c70a4fe8e113a0ed29	however , viruses often evolve quickly , and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies ( antigenic drift ) .
1c5876f59b8eb7da373512c70a4fe8e113a0ed29	this limitation of the antibody - mediated immunity could be addressed by the t - cell mediated immunity , which is able to recognize conserved viral hla peptides presented on virus - infected cells .
1c5876f59b8eb7da373512c70a4fe8e113a0ed29	thus , by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a virus , t - cell epitope - based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus .

d2ae3d2af48d42004a582f98f50b0dc0ba96710e	negative reinforcement models of substance use posit that elevations in stress from the covid-19 pandemic will elicit a corresponding motivation to downregulate covid-19-related stress reactivity via substance use for a subset of the population .
d2ae3d2af48d42004a582f98f50b0dc0ba96710e	the current study sought to evaluate : 1 ) if covid-19-related worry and fear were associated with substance use coping motives ; and 2 ) how levels of covid-19related worry and fear differ between pre - covid-19 substance users , covid-19 substance initiators , and abstainers .
d2ae3d2af48d42004a582f98f50b0dc0ba96710e	results indicated that covid-19-related worry was associated with substance use coping motives .
d2ae3d2af48d42004a582f98f50b0dc0ba96710e	additionally , compared to abstainers , pre - covid-19 substance users and covid-19 substance initiators demonstrated the highest levels of worry and fear .
d2ae3d2af48d42004a582f98f50b0dc0ba96710e	examination of differences suggested that the covid-19 substance initiators had the highest covid-19-related worry and fear for all substances except for opioids , with effect size estimates ranging from small to medium .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	about 14,000 paired sera , from patients with various types of acute infectious diseases with suspected viral origin , were screened by complement fixation against a wide set of viral antigens , including coronavirus oc43 .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	a significant change in oc43 antibodies was recorded in 33 cases and a constant high titre , defined as a titre occurring in the respective age group in less than 1 % of all sera examined , was found in 45 cases .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	on the basis of careful retrospective analysis of hospital case records it was concluded that in 28 cases with an increase of oc43 antibody titres , and in two with titre decrease , a disease could be associated with an acute coronavirus infection .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	in 16 cases the disease was dominated by respiratory symptoms .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	eight of these patients , four children and four adults , had pneumonia .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	three of the eight pneumonia patients had , however , another concomitant infection , too .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	among the patients with a statistically significant high titre of oc43 antibodies , there were 14 cases where a suggestive association with a disease could be envisaged on the basis of hospital records .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	five of these patients had pneumonia .
3a2faeb2a5dd6380694b5ec430cd00616d8a3f1e	these results suggest that human coronaviruses , so far considered only as one group of causative agents of the conimon cold , may also be associated with other and more severe diseases in all age groups .

3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	however , it remains unclear if apn - null neonatal pigs are protected from tgev .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	here we report the generation of apn - null pigs by using crispr / cas9 technology followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	apn - null pigs are produced with normal pregnancy rate and viability , indicating lack of apn is not embryonic lethal .

3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	histopathological analyses indicate apn - null pigs exhibit normal small intestine villi , while wildtype pigs show typical lesions in small intestines .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	immunochemistry analyses confirm that no transmissible gastroenteritis virus antigen is detected in target tissues in apn - null piglets .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	however , upon porcine epidemic diarrhea virus challenge , apnnull pigs are still susceptible with 100 % mortality .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	collectively , this report provides a viable tool for producing animals with enhanced resistance to tgev and clarifies that apn is dispensable for the pedv infection in pigs .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	swine enteric coronavirus disease is a devastating disease that has caused significant economic losses to the global swine industry 1 .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) have traditionally been the major etiological agents of swine enteric diseases , in particular , in asia .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	since 2010 , greater economic losses have been made due to the outbreak of emerging and reemerging covs , including variant strains of pedv 2 , porcine deltacoronavirus ( pdcov ) and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus ( sads - cov ) 3 - 5 .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	they infects the small intestine and can induce watery diarrhea and vomiting , eventually leading to dehydration , body weight loss , and other devastating outcomes .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	to date , no effective means are available to control these diseases .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	receptor binding and cellular entry are crucial for understanding of the infection processes , host range and tropism of a virus as well as identifying targets for antiviral interventions 6 .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	for example , cd163 has been identified as an entry receptor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( prrs ) virus and subsequent studies demonstrated that cd163-null pigs are immune to prrs , which presents a valuable resource for breeding prrs - resistant pigs 7 .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	aminopeptidase - n ( apn ) is widely present in the membrane of the epithelial cells of the small intestine in a variety of species , including pigs .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	in addition , it has been shown to be involved in multiple functions , including peptide metabolism , cell adhesion and cholesterol uptake 8 .

3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	to resolve unambiguously the functional requirement for porcine apn in tgev and pedv infection in vivo , apn - null pigs have to be produced and viral challenge assay performed .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	recently , whitworth et al . have reported apn - null post - weaning pigs are resistant to tgev but not pedv 20 .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	however , tgev and pedv primarily affect suckling piglets with up to 100 % mortality and post - weaning pigs have been shown to be less susceptible to these viruses 21 .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	we believe it is more biological relevant to determine if apn - null neonatal piglets ( < 10 days ) are resistant to tgev and pedv .
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	meanwhile , only 1 apn - null piglet was used for pedv challenge experiment in whitworth
3e168aef44683549563640db5ca32da62be4e27b	here , we generated apn - null pigs using crispr / cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer ( scnt ) technology .

355cbe4a6db240e40913a9e005d99c37ae7bba3c	high - throughput screening ( hts ) of large compound libraries has become a commonly used method for the identification of drug leads , and nonphysiological reducing agents have been widely used for hts .
355cbe4a6db240e40913a9e005d99c37ae7bba3c	however , a comparison of the difference in the hts results based on the choice of reducing agent used and potency comparisons of selected inhibitors has not been done with the physiological reducing agent reduced glutathione ( gsh ) .

1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	prompt detection and effective control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( prrsv ) during outbreaks is important given its immense adverse impact on the swine industry .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	in this study , we evaluated the ability of oxford nanopore minion direct rna sequencing to generate a prrsv whole genome sequence and detect and discriminate virus at the strain - level .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	overall , direct viral rna sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis proves to be a promising approach for identification of the viral strain or strains involved in clinical infections , allowing for more precise prevention and control strategies during prrsv outbreaks .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	2 of 18 against a new introduction from outside the farm indicates a need for enhanced biosecurity , while a re - break of a resident strain suggests better strategies for an elimination or vaccination program are needed .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	another big challenge for prrs control is that prrsv vaccine is not completely effective at preventing and controlling infection due to the high genetic diversity of the virus , thus outbreaks still occur in vaccinated herds [ 13 ]
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	a diagnostic method which can provide genetic information about the strain causing infection would allow for identification of potential reasons for vaccination failure , such as limited cross - protection due to high genetic divergence from vaccine [ 17 ] , or in the case of genetic similarity to vaccine , perhaps a reversion to virulence ( escape mutation ) of the vaccine itself [ 18 ] .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	the increasing incidence of co - infections of multiple strains further complicates prrs diagnosis and control [ 26 ] .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	hence , diagnostic tools that can provide more genetic information are extremely important for investigation , prevention , and control strategies for prrsv outbreaks .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	real - time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - qpcr ) testing , which has the advantages of short turnaround time and high sensitivity [ 27 , 28 ] , is currently the primary molecular diagnostic method for prrsv detection and is performed routinely in diagnostic laboratories .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	nucleic acid sequencing technologies have been incorporated as a new diagnostic tool in recent years to provide necessary support , such as strain information , for pcr in clinical sample diagnostics [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	sequencing approaches have been applied successfully to various fields in virology so far , such as the discovery of novel viruses / strains , whole viral genome sequencing , quasispecies detection , and epidemiological investigations [ 34 , 35 ] .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	the routine use of viral genome sequencing and genomic surveillance will not only serve as a powerful tool for prrsv detection [ 37 ] , but also provides researchers with a better understanding of prrsv epidemiology and how the virus transmits , spreads , and evolves , thus facilitating effective prevention and control measures [ 38 ] .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	conventional sequencing methods for rna viruses usually includes reverse transcription and pcr amplification during library preparation which is then followed by amplicon sequencing .
1cb0c02329d10e7513faabdc57113172591d5406	influenza virus was the first pathogen to be successfully sequenced in its native rna format by direct rna sequencing ( drs ) using oxford nanopore minion technology [ 44 ] .

90a7c8a2e1be47616b2f04bd011c148fcbc8adba	additionally , using a dual luciferase assay , it can be shown that a hairpin stimulated +1 frameshifting when placed upstream of a +1 shifty site in yeast .
90a7c8a2e1be47616b2f04bd011c148fcbc8adba	the investigations indicate that the hairpin is indeed a cis - acting programmed reading - frame switch modulator .
90a7c8a2e1be47616b2f04bd011c148fcbc8adba	since the upstream hairpin is unwound ( by a marching ribosome ) before the downstream stimulator , this study 's findings suggest a new mode of translational regulation that is mediated by the reformed stem of a ribosomal unwound rna hairpin during elongation .

b2545d28198bb9e312a42af3884fc043c2482690	wdnhbe cells produced an innate immune response to iav - infection with increased transcription of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the antiviral viperin but reduced expression of the mucin - encoding muc5b , which may impair mucociliary clearance .
b2545d28198bb9e312a42af3884fc043c2482690	poly(i : c ) produced similar responses to iav , with the exception of muc5b expression which was more than 3-fold higher than for control cells .

d04f10a35adf7daa66ebda57b141ed79abac0a2c	however , investigation of the adcc epitopes on the highly immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin ( ha ) head region has been rarely reported .
d04f10a35adf7daa66ebda57b141ed79abac0a2c	in this study , we determined the adcc and antiviral activities of two putative adcc epitopes , designated e1 and e2 , on the ha head of a pandemic h1n1 influenza virus in vitro and in a lethal mouse model .
d04f10a35adf7daa66ebda57b141ed79abac0a2c	importantly , the induction of adcc response modestly decreased viral load in the lungs of h1n1-infected mice .
d04f10a35adf7daa66ebda57b141ed79abac0a2c	however , the elevated adcc significantly increased mouse alveolar damage and mortality than that of the pbs - vaccinated group ( p < 0.0001 ) .
d04f10a35adf7daa66ebda57b141ed79abac0a2c	the phenotype was potentially due to an exaggerated inflammatory cell infiltration triggered by adcc , as an upregulated release of cytotoxic granules ( perforin ) was observed in the lung tissue of e1-vaccinated mice after h1n1 influenza virus challenge .

20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	sir , the use of hydroxychloroquine against covid-19 is controversial following the report of a case series of covid-19 patients with inflammatory diseases [ i.e. systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , rheumatoid arthritis or sarcoidosis ] treated with hydroxychloroquine .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	upon arrival , he was conscious , oriented and without cardiac disorders .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	the patient reported the onset , 9 days earlier , of a cough ( without sputum ) , with feverish sensation , myalgia , rhinitis and confusional syndrome with memory loss .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	his gp ordered a cough suppressant .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	his medical history included sarcoidosis affecting the lungs , skin and heart requiring the installation of a pacemaker and prescription of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg q12h and prednisone 7 mg q24h for 1 year .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	since that day , the multivisceral sarcoidosis was controlled by this dual therapy .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	given the clinical picture in the emergency department , empirical antibiotic and antiviral therapy [ ceftriaxone ( 1 g q24h ) , spiramycin ( 1 miu q8h ) and oseltamivir ( 75 mg q12h ) ] was prescribed with 2 - 3 l / min oxygen ( via mask ) .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	the chest ct scan showed small areas of ground - glass opacities , i.e. typical lesions of sars - cov-2 infection , and a nasopharyngeal sample returned positive for sars - cov-2 by rt - pcr ( ct = 16.53 ) .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	in light of the latter results , he was then referred to the infectious diseases department , where antibiotics and oseltamivir were discontinued .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	hydroxychloroquine was maintained for his sarcoidosis .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	two days after his hospitalization ( d2 ) , he had severe acute respiratory distress .

20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	the blood c trough of hydroxychloroquine was < 200 ng / ml , suggesting a lack of previous treatment adherence with the absence of visceral progression of the sarcoidosis .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	in parallel , we determined lopinavir and ritonavir plasma c trough using lc coupled with tandem ms : 19 672 and 1744 ng / ml , respectively ( uplc - msms xevo , waters , usa ) .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	at d10 , we determined the plasma concentration of hydroxychloroquine , on top of lopinavir / ritonavir , using uplc - msms xevo ( limit of quantification
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	5 hydroxychloroquine , lopinavir and ritonavir plasma c trough were 242 , 6430 and 261 ng / ml , respectively .
20602b061dedd2dc994398b20c41358c0318fe51	at the same time , crp was 3 mg / l. hydroxychloroquine plasma c trough was > 100 ng / ml suggesting an adequate penetration in the pulmonary compartment with an expected unbound inhibitory quotient in tissue

9f3a074cf50bbc8bc2fbbe209bf4dc980d9006d6	in this work , medical waste ( mw ) incinerator fly ashes from different types of incinerators were subjected to supercritical water ( scw ) and scw + h 2 o 2 ( scwh ) treatments .
9f3a074cf50bbc8bc2fbbe209bf4dc980d9006d6	sequential extraction experiments showed that , after scw treatment , heavy metals in exchangeable and carbonate forms in the ashes could be transferred into other relatively stable forms , e.g. , ba and cr into residual fraction , cu and pb into organic matter fraction .
9f3a074cf50bbc8bc2fbbe209bf4dc980d9006d6	therefore , it is necessary to neutralize acidic ash to near neutral condition before subjecting it to scw and scwh treatments so as to effectively stabilize hazardous elements in the ash .
427bcae955765973787a270cb420e3f90acc4ccf	despite the pioneering efforts to identify correlates of passive immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) , effective vaccines for the control of tge in suckling pigs have remained elusive .
427bcae955765973787a270cb420e3f90acc4ccf	the initial concept of an enteromammary immunologic axis in monogastrics originated from studies oflactogenic immunity to tgev in swine .
427bcae955765973787a270cb420e3f90acc4ccf	these studies revealed that infection of pregnant swine with virulent tgev stimulated high titers of siga antibodies in milk which correlated with protection of suckling pigs against tge ; parenteral or oral inoculation with live attenuated or killed tgev vaccines induced mainly igg antibodies in milk which generally provided poor protection to suckling pigs .
427bcae955765973787a270cb420e3f90acc4ccf	the recent appearance of prcv infections in swine and continuing studies of tgev infections , present a unique model for further studies of mucosal immunity .
427bcae955765973787a270cb420e3f90acc4ccf	research using these viruses has increased our understanding of the various components of the common mucosal immune system and their interactions .
427bcae955765973787a270cb420e3f90acc4ccf	although the most important consideration in designing an effective vaccine for tgev is the stimulation of galt through intestinal virus replication , studies addressing the contribution of balt to immunity to tgev and prcv may provide insights for alternative vaccine approaches .
427bcae955765973787a270cb420e3f90acc4ccf	virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of the immune response at the respective site and may be necessary for the recruitment of specific immune cells from other mucosal inductive sites , i.e. , galt to balt and balt to galt migration .
427bcae955765973787a270cb420e3f90acc4ccf	further studies on the induction and immune regulation of specific responses to tgev and prcv that affect the distribution patterns of igm- , iggand iga - antibody - secreting cells ( asc ) and t lymphocytes should provide valuable insights for optimizing vaccine regimens to elicit the highest mucosal immune responses and optimal protection against tgev challenge .

ddfd2a01cc8bad81f00abe266c74159f5f2efd9b	although controlled to some degree by live and inactivated vaccines , a new generation of ib vaccines is called for .
ddfd2a01cc8bad81f00abe266c74159f5f2efd9b	reverse genetic or ' infectious clone ' systems , which allow the manipulation of the ibv genome , are key to this development .
ddfd2a01cc8bad81f00abe266c74159f5f2efd9b	new vaccines would ideally be : genetically stable ( i.e. maintain a stable attenuated phenotype ) ; administered in ovo ; and be flexible with respect to the source of the spike protein gene .
ddfd2a01cc8bad81f00abe266c74159f5f2efd9b	being able to modify a ' core ' vaccine strain to make it applicable to a prevailing serotype requires a procedure for doing so , and the demonstration that ' spike - swapping ' is sufficient to induce good immunity .
ddfd2a01cc8bad81f00abe266c74159f5f2efd9b	failure to produce these proteins had little detrimental affect on the titre of virus produced .
ddfd2a01cc8bad81f00abe266c74159f5f2efd9b	that said , plaque size and composition of various gene 3/5 recombinant ibvs in cell culture , and reduced output and ciliostasis in tracheal organ cultures , shows that they are less aggressive than the wild - type beaudette .
ddfd2a01cc8bad81f00abe266c74159f5f2efd9b	replacing the s protein gene of beaudette with that from the pathogenic m41 strain resulted in a recombinant virus that was still nonpathogenic but which did induce protection against challenge with m41 .

15d52271667c76c6db91907ad72ecb65fb88ec84	association index ( ai ) values and parsimony scores ( ps ) were significant ( p - value < 0.05 ) , indicating that dispersion of h5n1 in egypt was geographically structured .
15d52271667c76c6db91907ad72ecb65fb88ec84	in addition , the ash sharqiyah to al gharbiyah and al fayyum to al qalyubiyah routes had the strongest statistical support .
15d52271667c76c6db91907ad72ecb65fb88ec84	: we found that the majority of routes with strong statistical support were in the heavily populated delta region .
15d52271667c76c6db91907ad72ecb65fb88ec84	in particular , the al qalyubiyah governorate appears to represent a popular location for virus transition as it represented a large portion of branches in both trees .
15d52271667c76c6db91907ad72ecb65fb88ec84	however , there remains uncertainty about virus dispersion to and from this location and thus more research needs to be conducted in order to examine this .
15d52271667c76c6db91907ad72ecb65fb88ec84	phylogeography can highlight the drivers of h5n1 emergence and spread .
15d52271667c76c6db91907ad72ecb65fb88ec84	for egypt , future work should focus on using data about vaccination and live bird markets in phylogeography models to study their impact on h5n1 diffusion within the country .

52cc3dfa387a37f4fa73b7c262ed8e66f1b1d60e	at 48 hpi , the passage was found to be constructed by er - tr7 antigen ( erag)-positive fibers ( erfibs ) associated with laminin and collagen iii between the fourth ventricle and meninges at the cerebellopontine angle .
52cc3dfa387a37f4fa73b7c262ed8e66f1b1d60e	the construct of the fibers mimics the reticular fibers of the fibroblastic reticular network , which comprises a conduit system in the lymphoid organs .
52cc3dfa387a37f4fa73b7c262ed8e66f1b1d60e	in the meninges , erfibs together with collagen fibers , lining in a striped pattern , made up a pile of thin sheets .
52cc3dfa387a37f4fa73b7c262ed8e66f1b1d60e	in the brain parenchyma , mature erfibs associated with laminin were found around blood vessels .
52cc3dfa387a37f4fa73b7c262ed8e66f1b1d60e	besides mature erfibs , immature erfibs without associations with other extracellular matrix components like laminin and collagen appeared after infection , suggesting that the cns creates a unique conduit system for immune communication triggered by viral invasion .

d8c9e595bccd8a8d6a17d8a9d38c9aeef1dc6577	significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in california and washington , compared with british columbia and alaska .
d8c9e595bccd8a8d6a17d8a9d38c9aeef1dc6577	in california , habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds .
d8c9e595bccd8a8d6a17d8a9d38c9aeef1dc6577	consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk .
d8c9e595bccd8a8d6a17d8a9d38c9aeef1dc6577	these findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for toxoplasma gondii , with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features , ocean physical processes , and invertebrate bioconcentration .
d8c9e595bccd8a8d6a17d8a9d38c9aeef1dc6577	sarcocystis neurona , most widely known as the main etiologic agent of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis , is one of two pathogens that causes fatal protozoal encephalitis ( pe ) in sea otters ( enhydra lutris ) .
d8c9e595bccd8a8d6a17d8a9d38c9aeef1dc6577	following recognition of this disease in sea otters 1 , s. neurona and toxoplasma gondii were identified as important causes of mortality of southern sea otters ( e. lutris nereis ) 1 .
d8c9e595bccd8a8d6a17d8a9d38c9aeef1dc6577	although exposure to s. neurona may be slightly less common overall 2 , s. neurona - related disease is generally more severe , at least in acute and subacute cases 1,2 .

1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	in order to gain entry into cells , diverse viruses , including ebola virus , sars - coronavirus and the emerging mers - coronavirus , depend on activation of their envelope glycoproteins by host cell proteases .
1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	the respective enzymes are thus excellent targets for antiviral intervention .
1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	in cell culture , activation of ebola virus , as well as sars - and mers - coronavirus can be accomplished by the endosomal cysteine proteases , cathepsin l ( ctsl ) and cathepsin b ( ctsb ) .
1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	in addition , sars - and mers - coronavirus can use serine proteases localized at the cell surface , for their activation .
1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	we report here that the cysteine protease inhibitor k11777 , amino}-3-phenylpropanamide ) and closely - related vinylsulfones act as broad - spectrum antivirals by targeting cathepsin - mediated cell entry .

1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	in order to assess whether cysteine or serine proteases promote viral spread in the host , we compared the antiviral activity of an optimized k11777-derivative with that of camostat , an inhibitor of tmprss2 and related serine proteases .
1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	employing a pathogenic animal model of sars - cov infection , we demonstrated that viral spread and pathogenesis of sars - cov is driven by serine rather than cysteine proteases and can be effectively prevented by camostat .
1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	camostat has been clinically used to treat chronic pancreatitis , and thus represents an exciting potential therapeutic for respiratory coronavirus infections .
1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42	our results indicate that camostat , or similar serine protease inhibitors , might be an effective option for treatment of sars and potentially mers , while vinyl sulfone - based inhibitors are excellent lead candidates for ebola virus therapeutics .

eb0b73f2b5a3a098c7e4107e50b48cb9111705dd	the null hypothesis tested was that significant differences between the transcriptomic responses to viral infection of resistant and sensitive strains would not be detected .
eb0b73f2b5a3a098c7e4107e50b48cb9111705dd	this hypothesis was broadly rejected , with the most surprising observation being that the baseline ( control , unchallenged ) sensitive and resistant strains expressed distinguishable transcriptomic signatures .
eb0b73f2b5a3a098c7e4107e50b48cb9111705dd	many of the genes differentiating resistant and sensitive lines are involved in protein metabolism , cellular trafficking , immune defense and stress response , although it was not possible to clearly identify candidate genes responsible for tsv resistance .
eb0b73f2b5a3a098c7e4107e50b48cb9111705dd	in contrast to tsv challenge , ysv either failed to perturb the host transcriptome or created a " confused " response that was difficult to interpret .

09417d5a567e93e35a80a241b9459f2b84ef0b0d	moreover , the anticancer molecular mechanism of dox / gl - alg ngps was investigated on hepg2 cells in vitro and tumor - bearing mice in vivo .
09417d5a567e93e35a80a241b9459f2b84ef0b0d	gl - alg ngps could not only avoid triggering the immuno - inflammatory responses of macrophages but also decreasing the phagocytosis of macrophage .
09417d5a567e93e35a80a241b9459f2b84ef0b0d	the bioavailability of dox was increased about 13.2 times by dox / gl - alg ngps than free dox in blood .
09417d5a567e93e35a80a241b9459f2b84ef0b0d	the mice with normal immune functions used in constructing the tumor - bearing mice instead of the nude mouse also indicated the good biocompatibility of ngps .
09417d5a567e93e35a80a241b9459f2b84ef0b0d	gl - mediated alg ngps exhibited excellent hepatocellular carcinoma targeting effect in vitro and in vivo .
09417d5a567e93e35a80a241b9459f2b84ef0b0d	the results suggested that the anticancer molecular mechanism of the combination therapy of glycyrrhizin and doxorubicin in alg ngps was performed via regulating apoptosis pathway of bax / bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity , which was also verified in h22 tumor - bearing mice .
09417d5a567e93e35a80a241b9459f2b84ef0b0d	gl - alg ngps could attenuate the activation of macrophage and enhance the therapeutic efficacy for hepatocellular carcinoma .

bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	to assess the susceptibility of individual cell lines , we generated a pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus bearing rv envelope proteins ( vsv - rv / ce2e1 ) .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	rubella is an acute infectious viral disease characterized by low - grade fever , a short - lived morbilliform rash , and lymphadenopathy 1 .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	additionally , arthritis often develops in rubella patients , particularly in adolescents and adult female patients , and encephalitis , while rare , is a severe complication of this disease .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	most importantly , neonates born from mothers who suffered from rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy may develop congenital rubella syndrome ( crs ) and multiple organ malformations .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	congenital cataracts , sensorineural hearing loss , and cardiovascular defects are most common in crs .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	rubella virus ( rv ) , the etiologic agent of rubella and crs , belongs to the genus rubivirus in the togaviridae family .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	only humans are the natural hosts for rv , but cell lines from monkeys , hamsters and rabbits such as vero , bhk , and rk-13 , respectively , are commonly used for isolation or propagation of rv , because rv replicates most efficiently in these cell lines 2 - 4 .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	understanding the cell types targeted by rv and the molecular basis for determining viral tropism is an important step for understanding the pathophysiology of rubella and crs .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( mog ) has been recently identified as a receptor for rv 5 .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	however , mog is expressed mainly in cells of central nervous system , and its expression is very low or undetectable in the cells from other organs or tissues .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	since rv generally causes a systemic infection , the pathology of rubella and crs can not be simply explained by the distribution pattern of mog .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	previous studies have indicated that membrane phospholipids and glycolipids , rather than cellular surface proteins , support rv infection , suggesting a functional role for membrane lipids in rv infections 6 , 7 .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) belongs to the genus vesiculovirus in the rhabdoviridae family , and the genome is a non - segmented negative - sense rna .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	| envelope proteins of different virus species can be incorporated into vsv particles , even when they are provided in trans , generating pseudotype vsvs .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	pseudotype vsvs enter cells through receptor binding and membrane fusion mediated by incorporated envelope proteins of different viruses , and the entry can be traced with reporter gene expression in the recombinant vsv genome 15 - 17 .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	results measuring the infectivity titer of a virus is fundamental in virus research .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	the host cells must be both susceptible and permissible for virus infection establishment .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	in this experiment , we have determined the 50 % cell culture infectious dose ( ccid 50 ) by using a limiting dilution method , in which multiple rounds of infection is allowed .
bdb4a76b9add4907c177c780d8318e3256dce7ca	the infectivity titer of a stock of the recombinant rv rhs strain was determined using various human cell lines and a monkey kidney - derived cell line , vero .

c8f6c26a8275c6cbbeb30dc984f058902455ed52	to improve the efficacy of this subunit vaccine , we identified a nonneutralizing epitope on zikv ediii surrounding residue 375 , which is buried in the full - length envelope protein but becomes exposed in recombinant ediii .

525766225d796f47f11026f4fc13dcc266d21698	to date there is still no available treatment for sars - cov-2 .
525766225d796f47f11026f4fc13dcc266d21698	clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide ( no ) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirusmediated acute respiratory syndrome , and this can be related to its viricidal effect .
525766225d796f47f11026f4fc13dcc266d21698	we hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled no administered during early phases of covid-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease .

1932ea139d08d1256a77ccdeeae510f6120ce6bf	to test the efficacy of the gsa in setting the optimum values for the hyperparameters of densenet121 , it was compared to another optimization algorithm called social ski driver ( ssd ) .

009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	currently , quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) is the gold 43 standard method to detect covid-19 .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	besides qrt - pcr , serological tests 48 that detect antibodies against sars - cov-2 are actively under development .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	however , such 49 tests have limited practical use for identifying infectious individuals as antibodies are only 50 detectable in later stages of infection when opportunities to treat and limit disease 51 transmission have passed .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	hence , there is still an unmet need for rapid , specific , and sensitive 52 point - of - care tests ( poct ) for sars - cov-2 that are easy to use and can be performed in 53 resource - limited settings .

009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	here , we report the development of crispr - dx for covid-19 that incorporate design 82 features that mitigate the loss in signal caused by genomic mutations or rna editing .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	notably , while our assay could tolerate single nucleotide variations 88 in the target sites , it still maintained high specificity and was able to distinguish sars - cov-89 2 from sars - cov and mers - cov reliably .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	taken together , our vanguard ( variant 90 nucleotide guard ) test holds the potential to address the need for a robust and rapid 91 diagnostic assay that will help arrest viral spread and enable worldwide economies to re - open 92 safely in the pandemic .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	94 95 we started off by examining the design of the earliest crispr - based assay for covid-19 15 .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	in this detectr assay , wildtype lbcas12a was paired with a 20-nucleotide ( nt ) grna 108 targeting the n - gene of sars - cov-2 .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	given that various cas12 enzymes had been 109 successfully utilized for human genome engineering , we asked if lbcas12a was the best 110 nuclease to deploy in a diagnostic test .

009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	( bp ) synthetic 115 dna fragment of the sars - cov-2 n gene .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	expectedly , lbcas12a was able to 117 clearly detect sars - cov-2 with no cross - reactivity for sars - cov or mers - cov at the 118 end of the reaction .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	nevertheless , the other four cas12a enzymes also performed similarly to 119 lbcas12a , with enascas12a yielding an even higher fluorescence signal than lbcas12a in 120 the presence of the intended sars - cov-2 substrate ( fig . 1b ) .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	we also found that the 121 minimum spacer length for the n - mam grna was 20nt , as shortening of the spacer led to a 122 reduction in fluorescence output for all the tested nucleases .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	we generated ten new grnas targeting the same n - mam locus , with each harbouring 126 a single point mutation at variable locations along the spacer ( fig . 1c ) .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	hence , our results suggest that enascas12a should be paired with 133 the n - mam grna to safeguard against viral mutations or rna editing at the target site .

009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	we wondered if there may be other grnas that could yield a stronger fluorescence signal 166 than the n - mam grna in our trans - cleavage assay .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	the genome of sars - cov-2 contains 167 two open reading frames ( orfs ) , orf1a and orf1b , that encode multiple non - structural 168 proteins ( nsps ) , four genes that encode conserved structural proteins ( spike protein [ s ] ,
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	169 8 envelope protein [ e ] , membrane protein [ m ] , and nucleocapsid protein [ n ] ) , and several 170 accessory orfs of unclear function
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	we aligned the genomes of sars - cov-2 , 171 sars - cov , and mers - cov and selected six additional target sites ( o1 , o2 , s1 , s2 , s3 , and 172 n1 ) that not only contained the necessary tttv protospacer adjacent motif ( pam ) for 173 cas12a but were also highly divergent between the three coronaviruses ( supplementary fig .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	we then analysed the collateral activities of our five cas12a enzymes paired with each of 175
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	3b and 179 supplementary fig . 6 ) , suggesting that ascas12a may be hyper - activated by certain grnas 180 in vitro without the need for it to cleave its intended target .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	overall , the three s - gene grnas were able to generate similar or higher fluorescence signals 184 than the n - mam grna
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	in particular , in the presence of the sars - cov-2 target , the 186 collateral activity of lbcas12a complexed with the s3 grna was approximately double that 187 of the same enzyme complexed with the n - mam grna
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	there was no cross - reactivity for sars - cov or mers -
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	we also confirmed that the 189 activity of our own purified protein was comparable to that of a commercially available 190 lbcas12a enzyme used in several recently announced crispr - based covid-19 diagnostic 191 assays 15,20,21 ( fig . 3c ) .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	subsequently , we investigated the mismatch tolerance of lbcas12a at 192 the s3 target locus but found that collateral activity was greatly diminished for all the 193 mismatched ( mm ) grnas tested ( fig . 3d , e and supplementary fig . 7 ) .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	hence , although the 194 s3 grna may be used in a highly specific assay for known sars - cov-2 isolates , it is not 195 ideal for a diagnostic assay that is robust against potential mutations at the target site .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	in the presence of the sars - cov-2 substrate , 200 this grna generated stronger fluorescence signals than the n - mam grna when paired with 201 lbcas12a , ascas12a , enascas12a , or enrvr
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	the 202 engineered enascas12a enzyme exhibited the highest collateral activity with the s2
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	strikingly , we now observed that lbcas12a exhibited the best overall tolerance for 261 mismatches , while ascas12a and its engineered variants became more sensitive to the 262 mismatches .
009acb86157053fb24a39e5ea3354a3608c9fef5	therefore , we carried out rt - lamp on 267 synthetic in vitro - transcribed ( ivt ) sars - cov-2 rna templates using this selected primer 268 set .

73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) is a major emerging zoonotic infectious disease .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	since its first outbreak in 2012 , the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases , causing 851 deaths .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	to date , there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against :
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	biorxiv preprint 2 mers - cov , increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	a critical step in the life cycle of mers - cov is the fusion with the host cell with its spike ( s ) protein as main determinant of viral entry .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	proteolytic cleavage of s exposes its fusion peptide ( fp ) , which initiates membrane fusion .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) fp have shown that calcium ( ca 2 + ) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a ca 2 + binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid ( e ) and aspartic acid ( d ) residues .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	sars - cov and mers - cov fp share a high sequence homology and here , we investigated whether ca 2 + is required for mers - cov fusion by substituting e and d residues in the mers - cov fp with neutrally charged alanines .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage , we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudoparticles ( pps ) on host cells without and with ca 2 + .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	our results demonstrate that intracellular ca 2 + enhances mers - cov wt pps infection by approximately two - fold and that e891 is a crucial residue for ca 2 + interaction .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to ca 2 + increasing mers - cov fp fusion - relevant membrane ordering .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	intriguingly , isothermal calorimetry titration showed that mers - cov fp binds one ca 2 + , as opposed to sars - cov fp which binds two .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	our data suggests that there are significant differences in fp - ca 2 + interactions of mers - cov and sars - cov fp despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of ca 2 + ions interacting with the fp has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	it is currently believed that disease outbreaks in humans result from interactions with dromedary camels .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	although transmissions between humans is rare , this route was responsible for a widespread outbreak of mers - cov in 2015 in south korea [ 6 ] .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	moreover , it was demonstrated that mers - like bat cov could potentially infect human tissues in the absence of an intermediate host when the respective tissue expresses a protease that is able to prime the virus for fusion [ 7 ] .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	more recently , the world health organization ( who ) listed mers - cov as one of ten diseases that requires urgent accelerated research and development because of its potential to cause a public health emergency with few or no efficacious drugs and/or vaccines to counter them [ 8 ] .
73d80c8f5780d70bd8d343188c56e898e91557b6	to address these needs , it is important to have a more nuanced understanding of mers - cov infection process to develop therapeutics to target crucial steps in mers - cov infection .

f3284e9c3eef64c4badcedf21d266309a360374a	furthermore , the temperatures of the individual buffer components were specifically influenced by microwave heating .
f3284e9c3eef64c4badcedf21d266309a360374a	we concluded that microwave heating accelerated isothermal rca of dna because of the differential heating mechanisms of microwaves on the temperatures of reaction components , although the overall reaction temperatures were the same .

886c69ba9b7fb6441b3dc9c06d77abf30e3a0703	recent studies suggest that ire1p and hac1 mrna , the only upr pathway found in yeast , evolves as a cognate system responsible for the robust upr induction .
886c69ba9b7fb6441b3dc9c06d77abf30e3a0703	here , we report that ire1 and its substrate bzip60 function as a strictly cognate enzymesubstrate pair to control viral pathogenesis in plants .

886c69ba9b7fb6441b3dc9c06d77abf30e3a0703	furthermore , we provide evidence that bzip60 and hac1 , products of the enzyme - substrate duet , rather than ire1 , are functionally replaceable to cope with er stress in yeast .
886c69ba9b7fb6441b3dc9c06d77abf30e3a0703	taken together , we conclude that the downstream signaling of the ire1mediated splicing is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and plants , and that the ire1-bzip60 upr pathway not only confers overlapping functions with the other upr branch in fundamental biology but also may exert a unique role in certain biological processes such as virus - plant interactions .
886c69ba9b7fb6441b3dc9c06d77abf30e3a0703	there are two functionally overlapping upr branches in plants , e.g. , ire1-bzip60 and s1p / s2p - bzip17 / bzip28 , but only one , ire1p - hac1 , in yeast .

886c69ba9b7fb6441b3dc9c06d77abf30e3a0703	finally , we demonstrate that the spliced form bzip60 and hac1p , rather than ire1 , are functionally replaceable to cope with abiotic stress in yeast , suggesting that the downstream signaling of the ire1-mediated splicing is evolutionary conserved in plants and yeast .

c03fd1659e0b27091c1ff54f539072cfd167ed66	phylogenomic analysis of sars - cov-2 as available from publicly available repositories suggests the presence of 3 prevalent groups of viral episomes ( super - clades ) , which are mostly associated with outbreaks in distinct geographic locations ( china , usa and europe ) .
c03fd1659e0b27091c1ff54f539072cfd167ed66	while levels of genomic variability between sars - cov-2 isolates are limited , to our knowledge , it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super - clades reflect ongoing adaptation of sars - cov-2 , or merely genetic drift and founder effects .
c03fd1659e0b27091c1ff54f539072cfd167ed66	here , we analyze more than 1100 complete , high quality sars - cov-2 genome sequences , and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns / signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of sars - cov-2 .
c03fd1659e0b27091c1ff54f539072cfd167ed66	our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects , coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus .
c03fd1659e0b27091c1ff54f539072cfd167ed66	we observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions ( including the rdb domain of the spike protein ) , the more variable genomic regions between extant sars - cov-2 episomes correspond with the 3 ' and 5 ' utrs , suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains .
c03fd1659e0b27091c1ff54f539072cfd167ed66	although this study can not be conclusive , we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of sars - cov-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen .

f65bccfea1356b48090695fe2f94b0e84d8c1fcc	it was observed that , in the case of xylose , a higher fraction of the carbon was converted into catabolic products ( butyrate , acetate , and ethanol ) and the biomass yield was approximately 20 % lower than on glucose , 0.16 versus 0.21 cmol x / cmol s.
f65bccfea1356b48090695fe2f94b0e84d8c1fcc	this lower yield is likely related to the need of an extra atp during xylose uptake .
f65bccfea1356b48090695fe2f94b0e84d8c1fcc	when submitted to a pulse of glucose , the population cultivated on xylose could instantaneously convert the glucose .
f65bccfea1356b48090695fe2f94b0e84d8c1fcc	no substrate preference was observed when glucose and xylose were fed simultaneously to the continuously operated bioreactor .

f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	the virus spike ( s )
f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	we have shown previously that an abl kinase inhibitor , imatinib , significantly reduces sars - cov and mers - cov viral titers and prevents endosomal entry by hiv sars s and mers s pseudotyped virions .
f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	sars - cov and mers - cov are classified as bsl-3 viruses , which can make experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging .
f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	here , we use ibv , a bsl-2 virus , as a model for studying the role of abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection .
f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	we found that imatinib and two specific abl kinase inhibitors , gnf2 and gnf5 , reduce ibv titers by blocking the first round of virus infection .
f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	additionally , all three drugs prevented ibv s - induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step .
f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	our results indicate that membrane fusion ( both virus - cell and cell - cell ) is blocked in the presence of abl kinase inhibitors .
f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	studying the effects of abl kinase inhibitors on ibv will be useful in identifying host cell pathways required for coronavirus infection .
f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce	this will provide insight into possible therapeutic targets to treat infections by current as well as newly emerging coronaviruses .

a466d42cb39e44cacc9d9923ddf169e6a9dad838	estimating the case fatality ratio ( cfr ) of a novel strain of influenza virus during the early stage of the pandemic is one of key epidemiological tasks to be conducted as rapid research response .
a466d42cb39e44cacc9d9923ddf169e6a9dad838	past experience during the epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and influenza a ( h1n1 - 2009 ) posed several technical challenges in estimating the cfr in real time .

a466d42cb39e44cacc9d9923ddf169e6a9dad838	to assess the reliability and validity of the proposed method , we examined the minimum length of time required for the assigned cfr to be included within the 95 % confidence intervals and for the estimated cfr to be below a prespecified cut - off value by means of monte carlo simulations .
a466d42cb39e44cacc9d9923ddf169e6a9dad838	overall , the smaller the transmission potential was , the longer it took to compare the estimated cfr against the cut - off value .

36240be6c2fd483a240641787a5be13df2b33277	h5n1 influenza virus has been a public health concern for more than a decade because of its frequent zoonoses and the high case fatality rate associated with human infections .
36240be6c2fd483a240641787a5be13df2b33277	severe disease following h5n1 influenza infection is often associated with dysregulated host innate immune response also known as cytokine storm but the virological and cellular basis of these responses has not been clearly described .
36240be6c2fd483a240641787a5be13df2b33277	we rescued a series of 6:2 reassortant viruses that combined a pr8 ha / na pairing with the internal gene segments from human adapted h1n1 , h3n2 , or avian h5n1 viruses and found that mice infected with the virus with h5n1 internal genes suffered severe weight loss associated with increased lung cytokines but not high viral load .
36240be6c2fd483a240641787a5be13df2b33277	this phenotype did not map to the ns gene segment , and ns1 protein of h5n1 virus functioned as a type i ifn antagonist as efficient as ns1 of h1n1 or h3n2 viruses .
36240be6c2fd483a240641787a5be13df2b33277	instead we discovered that the internal genes of h5n1 virus supported a much higher level of replication of viral rnas in myeloid cells in vitro , but not in epithelial cells and that this was associated with high induction of type i ifn in myeloid cells .
36240be6c2fd483a240641787a5be13df2b33277	we also found that in vivo during h5n1 recombinant virus infection cells of haematopoetic origin were infected and produced type i ifn and proinflammatory cytokines .
36240be6c2fd483a240641787a5be13df2b33277	taken together our data infer that human and avian influenza viruses are differently controlled by host factors in alternative cell types ; internal gene segments of avian h5n1 virus uniquely drove high viral replication in myeloid cells , which triggered an excessive cytokine production , resulting in severe immunopathology .

b66b7124cc6a866e889593cadc10a5fc0800b90e	aims - the aim of this study was to develop and demonstrate an approach for describing the diversity of human pathogenic viruses in an environmentally isolated viral metagenome .
b66b7124cc6a866e889593cadc10a5fc0800b90e	in silico bioinformatic experiments were used to select an optimum annotation strategy for discovering human viruses in virome datasets , and applied to annotate a class b biosolids virome .
b66b7124cc6a866e889593cadc10a5fc0800b90e	results from the in silico study indicated that less than 1 % errors in virus identification could be achieved when nucleotide - based search programs ( blastn or tblastx ) , viral genome only databases , and sequence reads greater than 200 nt were considered .
b66b7124cc6a866e889593cadc10a5fc0800b90e	within the 51,925 annotated sequences , 94 dna and 19 rna sequences were identified as human viruses .
b66b7124cc6a866e889593cadc10a5fc0800b90e	virus diversity included environmentally transmitted agents such as parechovirus , coronavirus , adenovirus , and aichi virus , as well as viruses associated with chronic human infections such as human herpes and hepatitis c viruses .
b66b7124cc6a866e889593cadc10a5fc0800b90e	this study provided a bioinformatic approach for identifying pathogens in a virome dataset , and demonstrated the human virus diversity in a relevant environmental sample .
b66b7124cc6a866e889593cadc10a5fc0800b90e	as the costs of next generation sequencing decrease , the pathogen diversity described by virus metagenomes will provide an unbiased guide for subsequent cell - culture and quantitative pathogen analyses , and ensures that highly enriched and relevant pathogens are not neglected in exposure and risk assessments .

2c49c91243848a43c9f2f6610fa237e3f0aaf339	in this study , we have searched publicly available transcriptomes for sequences similar to viruses of the nidovirales order .
2c49c91243848a43c9f2f6610fa237e3f0aaf339	we report two potential nidovirus genomes , a highly divergent 35.9 kb likely complete genome from the california sea hare aplysia californica , which we assign to a nidovirus named aplysia abyssovirus 1 ( aabv ) , and a coronavirus - like 22.3 kb partial genome from the ornamented pygmy frog microhyla fissipes , which we assign to a nidovirus named microhyla alphaletovirus 1 ( mlev ) .
2c49c91243848a43c9f2f6610fa237e3f0aaf339	aabv was shown to encode a functional main proteinase , and a translational readthrough signal .
2c49c91243848a43c9f2f6610fa237e3f0aaf339	mlev represents a sister group to the other known coronaviruses .
c9ef754a8e3fe8ddb161ee857a9b801de6d8f614	full - scale experiments and cfd simulations were performed to study potential inter - cubicle airborne transmissions through a shared anteroom due to the hinged door opening .
c9ef754a8e3fe8ddb161ee857a9b801de6d8f614	when doors are closed , current negative pressure designs are effective for the containment of airborne pathogens in the ' dirty ' cubicle with an index patient .
c9ef754a8e3fe8ddb161ee857a9b801de6d8f614	when the ' dirty ' cubicle door is open , airborne agents can move into the other ' clean ' cubicle via the shared anteroom .
c9ef754a8e3fe8ddb161ee857a9b801de6d8f614	when the dirty cubicle door remains fully open , temperature difference and concentration gradient across the doorway induce the two - way buoyancy - driven flow and transport of airborne agents across the doorway .
c9ef754a8e3fe8ddb161ee857a9b801de6d8f614	( 10 s , 30 s or 60 s ) or the smaller the air change rate ( 34e8.5 ach for each cubicle ) , the more airborne pathogens are being transported into the ' clean ' cubicle and the longer time it takes to remove them after the door is closed .
c9ef754a8e3fe8ddb161ee857a9b801de6d8f614	keeping the door completely open is potentially responsible for the majority of inter - cubicle transmissions if its duration is much longer than the duration of door motion ( only 3 s ) .
c9ef754a8e3fe8ddb161ee857a9b801de6d8f614	decreasing the duration of door opening , raising air change rate or using a curtain at the doorway are recommended to reduce inter - cubicle exposure hazards .
3f4cb266ec3abe44bf4d875d5c6a6a205d03c9cf	there are few and partially discordant data regarding nasopharyngeal rhinovirus ( rv ) load and viremia , and none of the published studies evaluated the two variables together .
3f4cb266ec3abe44bf4d875d5c6a6a205d03c9cf	the aim of this study was to provide new information concerning the clinical relevance of determining nasopharyngeal viral load and viremia when characterising rv infection .
3f4cb266ec3abe44bf4d875d5c6a6a205d03c9cf	nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 251 children upon their admission to hospital because of fever and signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection in order to identify the virus and determine its nasopharyngeal load , and a venous blood sample was taken in order to evaluate viremia .
3f4cb266ec3abe44bf4d875d5c6a6a205d03c9cf	fifty children ( 19.9 % ) had rv - positive nasopharyngeal swabs , six ( 12 % ) of whom also had rv viremia : rv - c in four cases ( 66.6 % ) , and rv - a and rv - b in one case each .
3f4cb266ec3abe44bf4d875d5c6a6a205d03c9cf	the rv nasopharyngeal load was significantly higher in the children with rv viremia ( p < 0.001 ) , who also had a higher respiratory rate ( p = 0.02 ) , white blood cell counts ( p = 0.008 ) and c - reactive protein levels ( p = 0.006 ) , lower blood o 2 saturation levels ( p = 0.005 ) , and more often required o 2 therapy ( p = 0.009 ) .
3f4cb266ec3abe44bf4d875d5c6a6a205d03c9cf	the presence of rv viremia is associated with a significantly higher nasopharyngeal viral load and more severe disease , which suggests that a high nasopharyngeal viral load is a prerequisite for viremia , and that viremia is associated with considerable clinical involvement .

8c6dd0cad7b723b44a8b557ca0f67d1ee38d88fb	in the twenty - first century , biology faces a problem that has previously vexed other disciplines such as physics , namely the prospect that its knowledge domain could be used to generate biological agents with altered properties that enhanced their weapon potential .
8c6dd0cad7b723b44a8b557ca0f67d1ee38d88fb	biological weapons bring the additional dimension that these could be self - replicating , easy to manufacture and synthesized with commonly available expertise .
8c6dd0cad7b723b44a8b557ca0f67d1ee38d88fb	the conundrum of dual use research of concern was crystallized by the so - called " gain - of - function " type of experiments in which avian influenza viruses were endowed with new properties in the laboratory such as increased virulence and the capacity for mammalian transmission .
8c6dd0cad7b723b44a8b557ca0f67d1ee38d88fb	after more than a decade of intensive discussion and controversy involving biological experiments with dual - use potential , there is no consensus on the issue except for the need to carry out such experiments in the safest conditions possible .
8c6dd0cad7b723b44a8b557ca0f67d1ee38d88fb	in this essay , we review the topic with the hindsight of several years and suggest that instead of prescribing prohibitions and experimental limitations the focus should be on the importance of scientific questions at hand .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) coronavirus has caused recurrent outbreaks in the arabian peninsula since 2012 .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	although mers has low overall human - to - human transmission potential , there is occasional amplification in the healthcare setting , a pattern reminiscent of the dynamics of
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) outbreaks in 2003 .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	here we provide a head - to - head comparison of exposure patterns and transmission dynamics of large hospital clusters of mers and sars , including the most recent south korean outbreak of mers in 2015 .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	to assess the unexpected nature of the recent south korean nosocomial outbreak of mers and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters , we compared exposure and transmission patterns for previously reported hospital clusters of mers and sars , based on individual - level data and transmission tree information .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	we carried out simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of mers and sars using branching process models rooted in transmission tree data , and inferred the probability and characteristics of large outbreaks .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	a significant fraction of mers cases were linked to the healthcare setting , ranging from 43.5 % for the nosocomial outbreak in jeddah , saudi arabia , in 2014 to 100 % for both the outbreak in al - hasa , saudi arabia , in 2013 and the outbreak in south korea in 2015 .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	both mers and sars nosocomial outbreaks are characterized by early nosocomial super - spreading events , with the reproduction number dropping below 1 within three to five disease generations .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	there was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of mers and sars : a majority of mers cases occurred among patients who sought care in the same facilities as the index case , whereas there was a greater concentration of sars cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	exposure patterns differed slightly by disease generation , however , especially for sars .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	moreover , the distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across individual hospital outbreaks ( kruskal - wallis test ; p < 0.0001 ) , with significantly higher transmission heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for mers than sars .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	simulations indicate a 2-fold higher probability of occurrence of large outbreaks ( > 100 cases ) for sars than mers ( 2 % versus 1 % ) ; however , owing to higher transmission heterogeneity , the largest outbreaks of mers are characterized by sharper incidence peaks .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	the probability of occurrence of mers outbreaks larger than the south korean cluster ( n = 186 ) is of the order of 1 % .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	our study suggests that the south korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses , with early super - spreading events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections , and the transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations .
30b285a628c951e7c2d73848be13204f59b2fa73	differences in relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of mers and sars could point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses .

c03933a114eec80322df43ecc12c981800a0fe3e	severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , an emerging disease characterized by atypical pneumonia , has recently been attributed to a novel coronavirus .
c03933a114eec80322df43ecc12c981800a0fe3e	the genome of sars coronavirus ( sars - cov ) has recently been sequenced , and a number of genes identified , including that of the nucleocapsid protein ( n ) .
c03933a114eec80322df43ecc12c981800a0fe3e	it is noted , however , that the n protein of sars - cov ( sars - cov n ) shares little homology with nucleocapsid proteins of other members of the coronavirus family [ science 300 ( 2003 ) 1399 ; science 300 ( 2003 ) 1394 ] .
c03933a114eec80322df43ecc12c981800a0fe3e	n proteins of other coronavirus have been reported to be involved in forming the viral core and also in the packaging and transcription of the viral rna .

06c07fc21e747316f8bf7287759a28fc6ebd6156	ace2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs .
06c07fc21e747316f8bf7287759a28fc6ebd6156	in human physiology , ace2 is a pivotal counter - regulatory enzyme to ace by the breakdown of angiotensin ii , the central player in the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system ( raas ) and the main substrate of ace2 .

06c07fc21e747316f8bf7287759a28fc6ebd6156	although ace2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised , ace2-expressing organs do not equally participate in covid-19 pathophysiology , implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage .
06c07fc21e747316f8bf7287759a28fc6ebd6156	reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of covid-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ace2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis .
06c07fc21e747316f8bf7287759a28fc6ebd6156	identifying pathologic changes caused by sars - cov-2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding covid-19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence - based treatment strategies .

d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193	we developed a data - driven drug repositioning framework , which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large - scale knowledge graph , literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against sars - cov-2 .
d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193	the retrospective study using the past sars - cov and mers - cov data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus .
d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193	our in silico screening followed by wet - lab validation indicated that a poly - adp - ribose polymerase 1 ( parp1 ) inhibitor , cvl218 , currently in phase i clinical trial , may be repurposed to treat covid-19 .
d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193	our in vitro assays revealed that cvl218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against sars - cov-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect .
d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193	in addition , we showed that cvl218 is able to suppress the cpg - induced il-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells , suggesting that it may also have anti - inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by sars - cov-2 infection .
d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193	further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of cvl218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity , indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by sars - cov-2 infection .
d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193	moreover , molecular docking simulation suggested that cvl218 may bind to the n - terminal domain of nucleocapsid
d9c15766ee9c84d154c0f691fc42cbd847668193	( n ) protein of sars - cov-2 , providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action .

4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	our current study compared five sars - cov-2 sequences from different geographical regions to those from sars , mers and two cold viruses , oc43 and 229e , to identify the presence of mir - like sequences .
4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	we identified seven key mirs , which highlight considerable differences between the sars - cov-2 sequences , compared with the other viruses .
4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	the level of conservation between the five sars - cov-2 sequences was identical but poor compared with the other sequences , with sars showing the highest degree of conservation .
4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	this decrease in similarity could result in reduced levels of transcriptional control , as well as a change in the physiological effect of the virus and associated host - pathogen responses .
4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	mers and the milder symptom viruses showed greater differences and even significant sequence gaps .
4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	this divergence away from the sars - cov-2 sequences broadly mirrors the phylogenetic relationships obtained from the whole - genome alignments .
4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	therefore , patterns of mutation , occurring during sequence divergence from the longer established human viruses to the more recent ones , may have led to the emergence of sequence motifs that can be related directly to the pathogenicity of sars - cov-2 .

4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	according to bioproject data ( prjna615032 ) , sars - cov-2 mediated transcriptomic alterations were similar to the target pathways of the selected 7 mirs identified in our study .
4f9fa486119f2e161206ca2f17f487e5b6352155	kegg pathway analysis revealed a number of critical pathways linked to the seven identified mirs that may provide insight into the interplay between the virus and comorbidities .

73fcc68f1fe5bf9cae21d939f459968ebed64411	here , we show that the hcv core protein downregulates the abundance of mir-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of gld-2 , a non - canonical cytoplasmic poly(a ) polymerase .
73fcc68f1fe5bf9cae21d939f459968ebed64411	the decrease in mir-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of the known functions of mir-122 , including its proviral activity for hcv .

3b3317a36059a322aa1cbde37ad48513be38b6ab	abundant ace2 immunostaining was found in lung , kidney , heart , and islets of pancreas , but not in hepatocytes .
3b3317a36059a322aa1cbde37ad48513be38b6ab	after 3 years , only two of these patients had diabetes .
3b3317a36059a322aa1cbde37ad48513be38b6ab	compared with their non - sars siblings , these patients exhibited no significant differences in fpg , postprandial glucose ( ppg ) , and insulin levels .
3b3317a36059a322aa1cbde37ad48513be38b6ab	the organ involvements of sars correlated with organ expression of ace2 .
3b3317a36059a322aa1cbde37ad48513be38b6ab	the localization of ace2 expression in the endocrine part of the pancreas suggests that sars coronavirus enters islets using ace2 as its receptor and damages islets causing acute diabetes .

1831b9b4ecd716560e565ea11c0ad1a01dbc9314	viral infection was monitored by a standard p24 or xgal staining assay .
1831b9b4ecd716560e565ea11c0ad1a01dbc9314	our data demonstrate that hocl - modified mouse- , bovine - and human serum albumins all bind to the hiv-1 nl4 - 3 gp120 ( lav ) glycoprotein in contrast to non - modified albumin .
1831b9b4ecd716560e565ea11c0ad1a01dbc9314	binding of hocl - modified albumin to gp120 correlated to the blockade of cd4 as well as that of v3 loop specific monoclonal antibody binding .
1831b9b4ecd716560e565ea11c0ad1a01dbc9314	/ gp41 envelope complex might be a simple but promising strategy to inactivate hiv-1 and therefore prevent infection when hocl - modified serum albumin is applied , for example , as a topical microbicide .
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	over the past two decades , the poultry sector in china went through a phase of tremendous growth as well as rapid intensification and concentration .
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	highly pathogenic avian influenza virus ( hpaiv )
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	subtype h5n1 was first detected in 1996 in guangdong province , south china and started spreading throughout asia in early 2004 .
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	since then , control of the disease in china has relied heavily on wide - scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control , quarantine and stamping out .
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	however , hpaiv h5n1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets ( lbms ) where viral infection can persist , which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them .
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	the use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in south china has identified areas where the success of current strategies for hpai control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the lbm network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining hpaiv h5n1 infection .
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	we produced a set of lbm network maps and estimated the associated risk of hpaiv h5n1 within lbms and along poultry market chains , providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined .
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	more specifically , our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning , daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in hpaiv h5n1 presence in lbms .
d78e23103bf25cb38b71d8eb38226f72074f6ae2	of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of hpaiv h5n1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in lbms .

a9211cfbf3e5afa35a25c841adc2e65eed47dd07	here , we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human - modified environments , or ' synanthropic ' species , are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re - emerging infectious diseases ( eids ) .
a9211cfbf3e5afa35a25c841adc2e65eed47dd07	we do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature .
a9211cfbf3e5afa35a25c841adc2e65eed47dd07	we find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases , and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species .
a9211cfbf3e5afa35a25c841adc2e65eed47dd07	since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human - induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss , our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion , global decline in biodiversity and a rise in eids of wildlife origin .

d024ad990b81f2ecf2ca1a3a0192ef66ddb5515b	given the devastating impact that covid-19 can have on the lung , it is natural to fear for patients with underlying copd .
d024ad990b81f2ecf2ca1a3a0192ef66ddb5515b	estimating their excess risk for contracting covid-19 and , in particular , its more severe respiratory manifestations has been a challenging exercise in this pandemic for various reasons .

7a3087521fb05ef9bc29193574d33bbec23b9b33	hrv14 did not induce ifnc , nos2 , cxcl8 and il-6 in hnec , but enhanced expression of the t cell attractant cxcl10 .
7a3087521fb05ef9bc29193574d33bbec23b9b33	on the other hand , hnec co - cultured with activated t cells produced cxcl10 at a level several orders of magnitude higher than that induced by hrv14 .
7a3087521fb05ef9bc29193574d33bbec23b9b33	albeit to a much lower degree , activated t cells also induced cxcl8 , il-6 and nos2 .

64b1932a62e969e6a6e889d0f3dc9a47f1886c83	in this paper , we introduce social network enabled flu trends ( sneft ) , a continuous data collection framework which monitors flu related messages on online social networks such as twitter and facebook and track the emergence and spread of an influenza .
64b1932a62e969e6a6e889d0f3dc9a47f1886c83	we show that text mining significantly enhances the correlation between online social network(osn ) data and the influenza like illness ( ili ) rates provided by centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .
64b1932a62e969e6a6e889d0f3dc9a47f1886c83	for accurate prediction , we implemented an auto - regression with exogenous input ( arx ) model which uses current osn data and cdc ili rates from previous weeks to predict current influenza statistics .
64b1932a62e969e6a6e889d0f3dc9a47f1886c83	our results show that , while previous ili data from the cdc offer a true ( but delayed ) assessment of a flu epidemic , osn data provides a real - time assessment of the current epidemic condition and can be used to compensate for the lack of current ili data .
64b1932a62e969e6a6e889d0f3dc9a47f1886c83	therefore , osn data can act as supplementary indicator to gauge influenza within a population and helps to discover flu trends ahead of cdc .

7df7153e8ffc1acdb336d3a30669cc5ecb8684a5	glycans are carbohydrate modifications typically found on proteins or lipids , and can act as ligands for glycan - binding proteins called lectins .
7df7153e8ffc1acdb336d3a30669cc5ecb8684a5	glycans and lectins play crucial roles in the function of cells and organs , and in the immune system of animals and humans .
7df7153e8ffc1acdb336d3a30669cc5ecb8684a5	viral pathogens use glycans and lectins that are encoded by their own or the host genome for their replication and spread .
7df7153e8ffc1acdb336d3a30669cc5ecb8684a5	recent advances in glycobiological research indicate that glycans and lectins mediate key interactions at the virus - host interface , controlling viral spread and/or activation of the immune system .
7df7153e8ffc1acdb336d3a30669cc5ecb8684a5	this review reflects on glycan - lectin interactions in the context of viral infection and antiviral immunity .
7df7153e8ffc1acdb336d3a30669cc5ecb8684a5	a short introduction illustrates the nature of glycans and lectins , and conveys the basic principles of their interactions .
7df7153e8ffc1acdb336d3a30669cc5ecb8684a5	subsequently , examples are discussed highlighting specific glycan - lectin interactions and how they affect the progress of viral infections , either benefiting the host or the virus .

4ffcc7a8343c57fa150069709d7720c1bb076ef7	moreover , features already known to be critical to successful impact welding of thin foils are captured by the combination of the high - fidelity eulerian control volume and the plasma pressure model , including the requisite collision velocity and impact angle .
4ffcc7a8343c57fa150069709d7720c1bb076ef7	a wavy interface arising from a regular pattern of material mixing is confirmed to occur , in addition to significant plastic strains and heat generation due to the plastic deformation , all of which indicate the formation of a collision joint due to the more realistic loading condition imposed .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	we agree that the indications for an ultrasound examination are mainly those of home and hospital triage , aimed at identifying lung involvement in patients with clinical signs suggestive of covid-19 and in whom both the chest radiographic findings and the polymerase chain reaction swab results for sars - cov-2 are negative ( variable percentages between 65 % and 35 % of cases ) .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	additionally , lus can be an excellent tool for monitoring patients with a diagnosis of covid-19 , following them during the different evolution phases of the disease .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	we also agree that the lus signs of covid-19 are not currently specific , also because most of them identify a physical state of the lung surface ( in general terms , a denser state ) rather than covid-19-specific anatomic or morphologic characteristics .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	only consolidations clearly represent anatomic alterations .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	however , lung consolidations appear in many conditions .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	with this being said , relative specificity can be attributed to the following findings when observed in the not - very - early stages : ( 1 ) a bilateral and patchy distribution of artifactual ( polymorphic ) findings ( with relatively spared areas ) ; and ( 2 ) multifocal white lung signs , which are not easily found in other diseases , especially in patients who are relatively young and without a history of lung disease .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	it is true that viral pneumonia can result in similar lus images , 8
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	but the viral pneumonia caused by covid-19 has a particular preference for producing superficial ground glass findings , 9 whose ultrasound expressions are white lung and confluent vertical artifacts .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	surely overlapping between diseases creates confusion , but this represents a weakness of many diagnostic methods .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	obviously , we need to understand how to enhance their strengths and limit their defects .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	the rapid onset of the coronavirus pandemic has not yet allowed us to refine alternative diagnostic options to computed tomography for this disease .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	ultrasound semeiotics of covid-19 pneumonia are at the initial stage of their understanding , and further studies are needed to fully unlock the potential of lus .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	in this regard , we can not exclude the possibility of defining patterns that are specific to covid-19 .
03953097732d99b727343bb72db0f7c89f0f79d9	in the meantime , we believe that a rational integration of lus ( used on the basis of the evidence acquired so far ) with the clinical data resulting from the traditional examination of the patient represents a useful strategy .

0e105b6e9745e61af820c835c386a079f69a717d	this review focuses on the monophyletic group of animal rna viruses united in the order nidovirales .
0e105b6e9745e61af820c835c386a079f69a717d	the order includes the distantly related coronaviruses , toroviruses , and roniviruses , which possess the largest known rna genomes ( from 26 to 32 kb ) and will therefore be called ' large ' nidoviruses in this review .
0e105b6e9745e61af820c835c386a079f69a717d	these include the nidovirus genetic plan and genome diversity , the composition of the replicase machinery and virus particles , virus - specific accessory genes , the mechanisms of rna and protein synthesis , and the origin and evolution of nidoviruses with small and large genomes .
0e105b6e9745e61af820c835c386a079f69a717d	replicase gene expression is under the principal control of a ribosomal frameshifting signal and a chymotrypsin - like protease , which is assisted by one or more papain - like proteases .

0e105b6e9745e61af820c835c386a079f69a717d	the acquisition of these enzymes may have improved the low fidelity of rna replication to allow genome expansion and give rise to the ancestors of small and , subsequently , large nidoviruses .

239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	fomite mediated transmission can be an important pathway causing significant disease transmission in number of settings such as schools , daycare centers , and long - term care facilities .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	the importance of these pathways relative to other transmission pathways such as direct person - person or airborne will depend on the characteristics of the particular pathogen and the venue in which transmission occurs .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	here we analyze fomite mediated transmission through a comparative analysis across multiple pathogens and venues .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	we developed and analyzed a compartmental model that explicitly accounts for fomite transmission by including pathogen transfer between hands and surfaces .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	we consider two sub - types of fomite - mediated transmission : direct fomite ( e.g. , shedding onto fomites ) and hand - fomite ( e.g. , shedding onto hands and then contacting fomites ) .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	we use this model to examine three pathogens with distinct environmental characteristics ( influenza , rhinovirus , and norovirus ) in four venue types .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	based on parameter estimates from the literature the reproductive number ( r 0 ) for the fomite route for rhinovirus and norovirus is greater than 1 in nearly all venues considered , suggesting that this route can sustain transmission .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	for influenza , on the other hand , r 0 for the fomite route is smaller suggesting many conditions in which the pathway may not sustain transmission .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	additionally , the direct fomite route is more relevant than the hand - fomite route for influenza and rhinovirus , compared to norovirus .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	the relative importance of the hand - fomite vs. direct fomite route for norovirus is strongly dependent on the fraction of pathogens initially shed to hands .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	fomite - mediated transmission is an important pathway for the three pathogens examined .
239f4596308a1247bf27a034c3cab95e0771215f	while fomite - based interventions may be able to lower r 0 for fomites below 1 and interrupt transmission , rhinovirus and norovirus are so infectious ( r 0

8051ba6a43e9cef2e65bf05df05f66f6d123f019	here we functionally analyzed the key amino acid residues located within receptor binding motif of rbd that may interact with human ace2 and available neutralizing antibodies .
8051ba6a43e9cef2e65bf05df05f66f6d123f019	the in vivo experiments showed that immunization with either the sars - cov rbd or sars - cov-2 rbd was able to induce strong clade - specific neutralizing antibodies in mice ; however , the cross - neutralizing activity was much weaker , indicating that there are distinct antigenic features in the rbds of the two viruses .
8051ba6a43e9cef2e65bf05df05f66f6d123f019	this finding was confirmed with the available neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against sars - cov or sars - cov-2 .
8051ba6a43e9cef2e65bf05df05f66f6d123f019	it is worth noting that a newly developed sars - cov-2 human antibody , ha001 , was able to neutralize sars - cov-2 , but failed to recognize sars -

b0dc52c7dc29bc8a0d52bab08b77eb2809db023e	we have previously shown that the poorly characterised e5 oncoprotein forms a virus - coded ion channel or viroporin that was sensitive to the amantadine derivative rimantadine .
b0dc52c7dc29bc8a0d52bab08b77eb2809db023e	we now demonstrate that alkylated imino sugars , which have antiviral activity against a number of viruses , inhibit e5 channel activity in vitro .
b0dc52c7dc29bc8a0d52bab08b77eb2809db023e	treatment with either rimantadine or imino sugars prevented erk - mapk phosphorylation and reduced cyclin b1 expression in cells expressing e5 from a number of high - risk hpv types .
b0dc52c7dc29bc8a0d52bab08b77eb2809db023e	these observations provide evidence of a key role for e5 viroporin function during the hpv life cycle .
b0dc52c7dc29bc8a0d52bab08b77eb2809db023e	viroporin inhibitors could be utilised for stratified treatment of hpv associated tumours prior to virus integration , or as true antiviral therapies to eliminate virus prior to malignant transformation .

4465b8957219de75fb5b7f7ed57069405572cf00	while hand hygiene has been widely promoted within australia , primary care providers ' ( pcps ) and parents ' understanding of hand hygiene importance , and their views on hand hygiene in reducing transmission of diseases in the community are unclear .
4465b8957219de75fb5b7f7ed57069405572cf00	therefore , the aim of this study was to explore the views of pcps and parents of young children on their knowledge and practice of hand hygiene in disease transmission .
4465b8957219de75fb5b7f7ed57069405572cf00	using a cross - sectional qualitative research design , we conducted 30 in - depth interviews with pcps and five focus groups with parents ( n = 50 ) between june 2014 and july 2015 in melbourne , australia .
4465b8957219de75fb5b7f7ed57069405572cf00	participants agreed that hand hygiene practice was important in reducing disease transmissions .
4465b8957219de75fb5b7f7ed57069405572cf00	however , barriers such as variations of hand hygiene habits , relating visibility to transmission ; concerns around young children being obsessed with washing hands ; children already being ' too clean ' and the need to build their immunity through exposure to dirt ; and scepticism
4465b8957219de75fb5b7f7ed57069405572cf00	that hand hygiene practice was achievable in young children , all hindered participants ' motivation to develop good hand hygiene behaviour in young children .

b183aee4718f56731fdb6a21ff9e3b11e70d29d1	in england , the reopening of mainly preschools and primary schools in june 2020 following the easing of national lockdown was associated with a total of 198 confirmed covid-19 cases ( 70 in children , 128 in staff members ) , of which 67 were single confirmed cases ( 30 in children , 37 in staff ) and 121 were linked to outbreaks ( 30 in children and 91 in staff ) .
b183aee4718f56731fdb6a21ff9e3b11e70d29d1	the number of outbreaks in educational settings correlated strongly with regional covid-19 incidence ( 0.51 outbreaks for each new sars - cov-2 infection per 100,000 in the community ; p=0.001 ) .
b183aee4718f56731fdb6a21ff9e3b11e70d29d1	the re - opening of schools was associated with very few covid-19 outbreaks after easing of national lockdown in england .
b183aee4718f56731fdb6a21ff9e3b11e70d29d1	sars - cov-2 infection and outbreaks were more likely to involve staff members , emphasising a need to improve education and infection control measures for this group both within and outside the educational setting .
b183aee4718f56731fdb6a21ff9e3b11e70d29d1	the strong correlation between covid-19 outbreaks and regional sars - cov-2 incidence highlights the importance of controlling the disease in the community to protect the staff and students in educational settings .
e3aafde5f8122763f92982f5b4361bab68348a63	since the covid-19 outbreak , researchers have been predicting how the epidemic will evolve , especially the number in each country , through using parametric extrapolations based on the history .
043b905037c2cbb7492b23e0d11b83f562972a82	the objective of this study was to conduct a critical analysis of the social , environmental and health risk factors in the mexican indigenous population in the context of the covid-19 disease pandemic , and to propose strategies to mitigate the impacts on these communities .
043b905037c2cbb7492b23e0d11b83f562972a82	regarding social factors , we identified the return of indigenous people to their communities , poor access to water , language barriers , and limited access to the internet , as factors that will not allow them to take the minimum preventive measures against the disease .
043b905037c2cbb7492b23e0d11b83f562972a82	in health , the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus , hypertension , respiratory tract infections , and chronic pulmonary diseases were identified .
043b905037c2cbb7492b23e0d11b83f562972a82	we believe that the best way to address these issues is to strengthen the health system with a community - based approach .
043b905037c2cbb7492b23e0d11b83f562972a82	health is the best element of cohesion for inserting development and progress proposals in indigenous communities , given the vulnerability to which they are exposed in the face of the covid-19 pandemic .

5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	during the current covid-19 pandemic , the global ratio between the dead and the survivors is approximately 1 to 10 , which has put humanity on high alert and provided strong motivation for the intensive search for vaccines and drugs .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	it is already clear that if we follow the most likely scenario , which is similar to that used to create seasonal influenza vaccines , then we will need to develop improved vaccine formulas every year to control the spread of the new , highly mutable coronavirus sars - cov-2 .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	in this article , using well - known rna viruses ( hiv , influenza viruses , hcv ) as examples , we consider the main successes and failures in creating primarily highly effective vaccines .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	the experience accumulated dealing with the biology of zoonotic rna viruses
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	suggests that the fight against covid-19 will be difficult and lengthy .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	the most effective vaccines against sars - cov-2 will be those able to form highly effective memory cells for both humoral ( memory b cells ) and cellular ( cross - reactive antiviral memory t cells ) immunity .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	unfortunately , rna viruses constantly sweep their tracks and perhaps one of the most promising solutions in the fight against the covid-19 pandemic is the creation of ' universal ' vaccines based on conservative sars - cov-2 genome sequences ( antigen - presenting ) and unmethylated cpg dinucleotides ( adjuvant ) in the composition of the phosphorothioate backbone of single - stranded dna oligonucleotides ( odn ) , which can be effective for long periods of use .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	here , we propose a sars - cov-2 vaccine based on a lasso - like phosphorothioate oligonucleotide construction containing cpg motifs and the antigen - presenting unique acg - containing genome sequence of sars - cov-2 .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	we found that cpg dinucleotides are the least rare dinucleotides in the genomes of sars - cov-2 and other known human coronaviruses , and hypothesized that their higher frequency could be responsible for the unwanted increased lethality to the host , causing a ' cytokine storm ' in people who overexpress cytokines through the activation of specific toll - like receptors in a manner similar to tlr9-cpg odn interactions .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	interestingly , the virus strains sequenced in china ( wuhan ) in february 2020 contained on average one cpg dinucleotide more in their genome than the later strains from the usa ( new york ) sequenced in may 2020 .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	obviously , during the first steps of the microevolution of sars - cov-2 in the human population , natural selection tends to select viral genomes containing fewer cpg motifs that do not trigger a strong innate immune response , so the infected person has moderate symptoms and spreads sars - cov-2 more readily .
5eb6d313e72392251a3ce7213f06f2a35beb166e	however , in our opinion , unmethylated cpg dinucleotides are also capable of preparing the host immune system for the coronavirus infection and should be present in sars - cov-2 vaccines as strong adjuvants .

dbd27297be0609a02729bd99ac744b997d9e647f	although much insight on the natural history of virus infection in bats has been gained from experimental infections 3 , 6 - 11 and mathematical modeling 12 - 15 , with the exception of nipah and rabies viruses 16 , 17 , relatively little is known about the long - term dynamics of the host immune response following primary virus infection .
dbd27297be0609a02729bd99ac744b997d9e647f	of particular interest is whether or not long - term protective immunity is established following virus infection .
dbd27297be0609a02729bd99ac744b997d9e647f	this gap in knowledge can be attributed to : 1 ) the difficulties associated with obtaining serial biological samples from individual bats comprising large colonial , interconnected populations and 2 ) the uncertainty of whether short - term experimental models of virus infection in bats recapitulate natural bat - virus infection dynamics .
dbd27297be0609a02729bd99ac744b997d9e647f	nonetheless , obtaining empirical data on the long - term dynamics of the bat immune response following virus infection is critical to understanding how bat - borne viruses are maintained in nature and identifying factors leading to virus spillover into humans .

dd8d8a018516c82d13c55b53c220e5e0c44c0efb	one of the aspects to be still clarified is the correlation between the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) and sars - cov-2 infection .
dd8d8a018516c82d13c55b53c220e5e0c44c0efb	ras is a physiological system playing a key role in different human body functions regulation .
dd8d8a018516c82d13c55b53c220e5e0c44c0efb	sars - cov-2 uses the angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ace-2 ) , a component of ras , as a potential factor of cell penetration and infectivity ; in addition , in the different infection stages , a functional variation of the ras has been noted .
dd8d8a018516c82d13c55b53c220e5e0c44c0efb	in this article , we discuss the correlation between the role of ras and system - modifying agents , angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors ( aceis ) , angiotensin ii receptor blockers ( arbs ) and direct renin inhibitors ( dris ) , with sars - cov-2 infection .

d6321dd7f37a6a2c009666bd25635680c77a016c	one injection of tocilizumab led to rapid improvements in clinical features , inflammatory findings , and oxygen supply in seven patients with severe covid-19 and substantial amelioration in two patients who were critically ill , whereas four patients , who exhibited rapidly worsened respiratory function , required artificial ventilatory support even after tocilizumab treatment .
d6321dd7f37a6a2c009666bd25635680c77a016c	three of these four patients ultimately recovered from deterioration after methylprednisolone treatment .
d6321dd7f37a6a2c009666bd25635680c77a016c	administration of tocilizumab did not affect viral elimination nor igg production specific for the virus .
d6321dd7f37a6a2c009666bd25635680c77a016c	compared with wellresponding patients , rapidly - worsened patients showed a significantly higher ratio of ferritin vs. crp .
d6321dd7f37a6a2c009666bd25635680c77a016c	these findings suggest that tocilizumab has beneficial effects in severeto - critically ill patients with covid-19 ; however , in some cases , addition of methylprednisolone is required for disease rescue .

ac30a85f52cf03b717bc74e0f58099d4644fd329	the contribution of cell - mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratory coronavirus ( prcv ) or tgev exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with tgev 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with prcv or tgev when 11 days old .
ac30a85f52cf03b717bc74e0f58099d4644fd329	prcv exposure induced partial protection against tgev challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases ( 42 % vs. 90 % in age - matched control pigs ) , limited virus shedding in feces , and increases in virusneutralizing serum antibody titers ; in contrast , all 11-day - old pigs inoculated with tgev were completely protected after challenge .
ac30a85f52cf03b717bc74e0f58099d4644fd329	once weaned , none of the prcv - exposed or age - matched control pigs had diarrhea after tgev challenge ; moreover , both groups exhibited less recta1 virus shedding than suckling pigs .
ac30a85f52cf03b717bc74e0f58099d4644fd329	vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses ( > 96 000 counts per minute ( cpm ) ) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric ( mln ) and bronchial ( bln )

7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	many antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) have multiple antimicrobial immunity effects .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	one such class of peptides is temporins .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	temporins are the smallest ( amps ) found in nature and are highly active against gram - positive bacteria .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	the conserved residues and 3d structural conformations of temporins ( amps ) were still unknown .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	the present study explores the sequence analysis , alpha - helical structural conformations of temporins .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	the sequence of temporins was deracinated from apd3 database , the three - dimensional structure was constructed by homology modeling studies .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	the sequence analysis results show that the conserved residues among the peptide sequences , the maximum of the sequences are 70 % alike to each other .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	the secondary structure prediction results revealed that 99 % of temporin ( amps ) exhibited in alpha - helical form .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	the 3d structure speculated using rampage exposes the alpha - helical conformation in all temporins ( amps ) .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	the phylogenetic analysis reveals the evolutionary relationships of temporins ( amps ) , which are branched into seven clusters .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	as a result , we identified a list of potential temporin amps which docked to the antiviral protein ( mers - cov ) , it shows good protein - peptide binding .
7840d34f75b63389a90c9e64b1709696b5e25683	this computational approach may serve as a good model for the rationale design of temporin based antibiotics .

7a539696b3b7a770b1fbc808cc0741662f712c1c	the 5 ' region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free , and a phylogeny calculated from this region confirmed that sars - cov-2 is closer to rmyn02 than ratg13 , and showed that sars - cov-2 diverged from rmyn02 at least 26 years ago , and both diverged from ratg13 at least 37 years ago ; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no additional information as they matched no other genbank sequences closely .
7a539696b3b7a770b1fbc808cc0741662f712c1c	simple pairwise comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non - synonymous changes probably occurred ; the duf3655 region of the nsp3 , the s gene and orf 8 gene .
7a539696b3b7a770b1fbc808cc0741662f712c1c	a hexamer of the proteins encoded by the nsp3 region may form the molecular pore spanning the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle ( wolff et al . , 2020 ) , and perhaps the acidic polypeptide encoded by duf3655 lines it , and presents a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention .

90e46adb07cfa781ece62dcefb59fed51dc1ce3d	this review discusses the current laboratory methods available to test for coronaviruses by focusing on the present covid-19 outbreak .
6e3807c5839f56d3fcde255de8a9520e3c4c7e02	sars - cov-2 was first detected in december 2019 in the chinese city of wuhan and has since spread across the world .
6e3807c5839f56d3fcde255de8a9520e3c4c7e02	at present , the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide .
6e3807c5839f56d3fcde255de8a9520e3c4c7e02	research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies .
6e3807c5839f56d3fcde255de8a9520e3c4c7e02	in view of the magnitude of the epidemic , we conducted a speculative review of possible medium - and long - term neurological consequences of sars - cov-2 infection , with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin , based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute sars - cov-2 infection .
6e3807c5839f56d3fcde255de8a9520e3c4c7e02	we systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of sars - cov-2 infection , the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system , and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system .

82a2c9757676e33f030ac98ffe2083ec37dbf7fe	however , information on the viruses harbored by these bats is scarce .
82a2c9757676e33f030ac98ffe2083ec37dbf7fe	in this study , coronavirus sequences were detected using a nested rt - pcr targeting 440 bp of the rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) in six of 79 fecal samples collected from an urban colony of e. helvum in ibadan , nigeria .
6d0642ab136ca94b744b076dd7b0baff3aa9ed0e	viruses cause a wide range of human diseases , ranging from acute self - resolving conditions to acute fatal diseases .
6d0642ab136ca94b744b076dd7b0baff3aa9ed0e	effects that arise long after the primary infection can also increase the propensity for chronic conditions or lead to the development of cancer .
6d0642ab136ca94b744b076dd7b0baff3aa9ed0e	the reviews assembled here focus on the interface between virology and pathology and encompass aspects of both the clinical pathology of viral disease and the underlying disease mechanisms .
6d0642ab136ca94b744b076dd7b0baff3aa9ed0e	we hope that this collection of articles will be of interest to a wide range of scientists and clinicians at a time when there is a renaissance in the appreciation of the power of pathology as virologists dissect the processes of disease .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	now , almost all countries of the world live in conditions of an ongoing viral pandemic attributed to the coronavirus disease 2019 .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	the contact of humankind with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) will have both immediate and long - term consequences not only for medicine and economics , but also for culture , politics , etc .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	given the fact that symptoms of covid-19 include a / hyposmia and a / hypogeusia , we should consider how this infection will affect the incidence of parkinson 's disease ( pd ; and/or other neurodegenerative diseases ) .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	i performed a literature review ( utilizing pubmed and google scholar ) focusing on neurological complications of influenza .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	there are few publications which report on the development of neurological symptoms relating to pd ( especially tremor and gait disturbance ) within a month after the influenza .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	in their theory , the agent penetrates into the nervous system through the nose or gastrointestinal system and results in an abnormal accumulation of the protein , alpha - synuclein , bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	so , the development of parkinsonian symptoms after viral respiratory diseases allows us to take a fresh look at the etiology and pathogenesis of pd .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	it is worth drawing a historical parallel with the postencephalitic lethargica parkinsonism that took place in the 1920s .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	the cause of the delayed development and progression of parkinsonian symptoms after the acute stage of encephalitis is still unknown .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	regarding pd , it is difficult to prove a causal relationship between influenza in the past and the development of parkinsonian symptoms because of the large number of years separating these events .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	it is possible that the development of pd can go according to the theory of " hit and run , " 2,5 as a result of numerous small " hits " ( which may include viral respiratory infections ) that occur throughout life .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	so , it is possible that the episode of a / hyposmia and a / hypogeusia during the covid-19 is a small " hit " for the development of parkinsonian symptoms in the future .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	perhaps physicians should soon , when examining a patient with suspected pd , clarify the fact of a / hyposmia and a / hypogeusia during the covid-19 epidemic .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	so , to date , there are few publications about symptoms of parkinsonism associated with a pandemic of respiratory viruses .
d90d92f17637049f5bf429b0fd6bddf4c7b3333c	undoubtedly , additional studies are needed to confirm/ refute the trigger effect of sars - cov-2 on the neuroinflammatory and -degenerative processes leading to the development of parkinsonian symptoms .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	in recent years , avian influenza virus h9n2 undergoing antigenic drift represents a threat to poultry farming as well as public health .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	current vaccines are restricted to inactivated vaccine strains and their related variants .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	virus assembly and viral protein composition were not affected by the transmembrane domain replacement .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	further , the recombinant tm - replaced h9n2-tm virus could provide better inter - clade protection in both mice and chickens against h9n2 , suggesting that the h3-tm - replacement could be considered as a strategy to develop efficient subtypespecific h9n2 influenza vaccines .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	h9n2 avian influenza virus was first isolated in turkeys in 1966 1 .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	since then , it became prevalent in poultry farming worldwide , resulting in egg production reduction and high mortality when co - infected with other pathogens 2,3 .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	though it is not highly pathogenic as h5n1 , researches revealed that it could re - assort with multiple other influenza subtypes and thus be " gene donor " for h5n1 and h7n9 viruses 6 - 8 .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	therefore , control of the h9n2 influenza virus is of great concern .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	vaccination utilizing vaccine strains and their relevant variants is the main strategy to control h9n2 pandemics in the poultry industry of china .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	however , the vaccine strains and their antigenic variants undergoing antigenic drift were responsible for the outbreak of h9n2 in the poultry farming of china during 2010 - 2013 9 .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	lack of cross - immune protection in the existing vaccines becomes a severe problem of effective protection against the virus .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	thus , a broad - spectrum vaccine which can provide cross - protection against different antigenic h9n2 variants is in urgent need .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	the genome of avian influenza virus contains a single - stranded , negative - sense segmented rna that encodes 12 proteins including hemagglutinin ( ha ) 10 .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	these are key steps for virus 's entre into cells and critical to further process of virus infection 11 , 12 .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	in acidic environment , substitution of the tm domain showed an abolishment of receptor binding and membrane fusion , leading to a failure of virus entry into the cells 14 , 15 .
1c39727d1bf8a4e67e43fccecf8dafcd9b960b70	in addition , this domain was found to be important for biological characteristics of the influenza viruses , such as viral replication , virulence and pathogenicity [ 16 ]
8e7d05c2e304aa0430befd8259b9bb6c863a0f29	avastroviruses have primarily been associated with infections of poultry , especially chicken , turkey , duck , and guineafowl production systems , but also infect wading birds and doves .
8e7d05c2e304aa0430befd8259b9bb6c863a0f29	outcomes result in a spectrum of disease , ranging from asymptomatic shedding to gastroenteritis with diarrhea , stunting , failure to thrive and death .
8e7d05c2e304aa0430befd8259b9bb6c863a0f29	virological surveillance was conducted in birds from two sites in cambodia in 2010 .
8e7d05c2e304aa0430befd8259b9bb6c863a0f29	samples were screened for influenza , astroviruses , coronaviruses , flaviviruses , and paramyxoviruses .

9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	background : post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) is one of the most prevalent long - term psychiatric diagnoses among survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) .
9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	the objective of this study was to identify the predictors of chronic ptsd in sars survivors .
9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	design : ptsd at 30 months after the sars outbreak was assessed by the structured clinical interview for the dsm - iv .
9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender as well as the presence of chronic medical illnesses diagnosed before the onset of sars and avascular necrosis were independent predictors of ptsd at 30 months post - sars .
9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	associated factors included higher - chance external locus of control , higher functional disability and higher average pain intensity .
9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	our findings do not support some prior hypotheses that the use of high dose corticosteroids is protective against the development of ptsd .
9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	on the contrary , the adversity both before and after the sars outbreak may be more important in hindering recovery from ptsd .
9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	the risk factor analysis can not only improve the detection of hidden psychiatric complications but also provide insight for the possible model of care delivery for the sars survivors .
9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc	with the complex interaction of the biopsychosocial challenges of sars , an integrated multidisciplinary clinic setting may be a superior approach in the long - term management of complicated ptsd cases .

c910cf0f8b98839fbb32df6b58ea93644962566c	given the early recognition of a new threat , and given the advances of biotechnology , vaccinology and information systems , it is not an unrealistic goal to have promising prototype vaccine candidates available in a short time span following the identification of a new infectious agent ; this is based on the assumption that the emerging infection is followed by natural immunity .
c910cf0f8b98839fbb32df6b58ea93644962566c	however , major bottlenecks for the deployment of emergency vaccine are lack of established systems for fast - track regulatory approval of such candidates and limited international vaccine production capacity .
c910cf0f8b98839fbb32df6b58ea93644962566c	in the present discussion paper , we propose mechanisms to facilitate development of emergency vaccines in europe by focusing on public - private scientific partnerships , fast - track approval of emergency vaccine by regulatory agencies and proposing incentives for emergency vaccine production in private vaccine companies .

c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers - cov ) was first identified in 2012 as a novel etiological agent of severe respiratory disease in humans .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	as during infection by other viruses , host sensing of viral double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) induces several antiviral pathways .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	these include interferon ( ifn ) , oligoadenylate synthetase ( oas)-rnase l , and protein kinase r ( pkr ) .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	coronaviruses , including mers - cov , potently suppress the activation of these pathways , inducing only modest host responses .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	our study describes the functions of two accessory proteins unique to mers - cov and related viruses , ns4a and ns4b , during infection in human airway epithelium - derived a549 cells .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	ns4a has been previously characterized as a dsrna binding protein , while ns4b is a 2=,5=-phosphodiesterase with structural and enzymatic similarity to ns2 encoded by mouse hepatitis virus ( mhv ) .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	all of the mutant viruses we tested exhibited slight decreases in replication .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	we previously reported that , like mhv ns2 , ns4b antagonizes oas - rnase l , but suppression of ifn is a previously unidentified function for viral phosphodiesterases .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	unexpectedly , deletion of ns4a does not result in robust activation of the pkr or oas - rnase l pathways .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	therefore , mers - cov likely encodes other proteins that contribute to suppression or evasion of these antiviral innate immune pathways that should be an important focus of future work .
c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	this study provides additional insight into the complex interactions between mers - cov and the host immune response .

c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	coronaviruses encode unique accessory proteins that are not required for replication but most likely play roles in immune antagonism and/or pathogenesis .

c850a9040414008da523d4ca13b8e61b36e0d98b	loss of these accessory proteins during mers - cov infection leads to host antiviral activation and modestly attenuates replication .

f582baa8aa4a5f3af8356e86df3d5c29ff426c85	most recently , two papers were published to show that zikv could infect mouse testis and cause its damage , leading to male infertility ( nature . ) .
f582baa8aa4a5f3af8356e86df3d5c29ff426c85	the authors of this manuscript have demonstrated that z2 peptide can be detected in most mouse organs , such as liver , kidney , spleen , heart , as well as placenta and fetal tissue .
f582baa8aa4a5f3af8356e86df3d5c29ff426c85	it would be very interesting if the authors are able to detect the presence of z2 peptide in the mouse testis tissue .
f582baa8aa4a5f3af8356e86df3d5c29ff426c85	if z2 can also enter the testis , application of this peptide may prevent the testis damage caused by zikv infection .
f582baa8aa4a5f3af8356e86df3d5c29ff426c85	the authors have demonstrated that z2 peptide can interact with zikv e protein expressed in the uninfected 293 t cells .
f582baa8aa4a5f3af8356e86df3d5c29ff426c85	however , it is unclear whether z2 can interact with the zikv surface protein ( e / m ) dimer .
f582baa8aa4a5f3af8356e86df3d5c29ff426c85	i would suggest the authors to show whether z2 peptide can interact with the zikv surface protein expressed on the zikv - infected bhk21 cells .

9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic is challenging our canadian emergency departments ( eds ) in unparalleled ways .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	as part of the frontline response , eds have had to adapt to the unique clinical difficulties associated with the constant threat of covid-19 , developing protocols and pathways in the setting of limited and evolving information .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	this has created an urgent need for targeted and adaptive training for all members of the emergency medicine healthcare team .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	the following commentary reflects the perspective of four emergency medicine simulation educators during the canadian response to covid-19 .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	recognizing that local needs and resources will vary , we highlight three key roles that simulation can play in the adaptive response to covid-19 : protocol development and system testing , provider education , and team - based training .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	the disruption to our practice as a result of covid-19 has required us to " build the plane as we fly , " and we believe simulation to be a key tool in this process .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	this pandemic has brought us to uncharted waters and has required the creation of new processes and protected protocols for intubation , code blue responses , and workflows within the ed .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	it seems only natural to apply our experience using simulation for systems testing to ed preparedness for covid-19 .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	integrating the plan - do - study - act conceptual framework for systems improvement into pandemic simulation activities allows for a rapid analysis of novel protocol development .
9ce4faf412d4cfd4d38d51476d7683bab7ffc867	in turn , this enhanced simulation strategy serves to identify the safest and most efficient and pragmatic approach to various emergent situations .

948df969a650f3e15cf444dbcfba54741b6d2b58	with a drug - repositioning strategy , ai can quickly detect drugs that can fight against emerging diseases such as covid-19 .
948df969a650f3e15cf444dbcfba54741b6d2b58	this technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery , planning , treatment , and reported outcomes of the covid-19 patient , being an evidence - based medical tool .
948df969a650f3e15cf444dbcfba54741b6d2b58	thus , there are chances that the application of the ai approach in drug discovery is feasible .
948df969a650f3e15cf444dbcfba54741b6d2b58	with prior usage experiences in patients , few of the old drugs , if shown active against sars - cov-2 , can be readily applied to treat the covid-19 patients .

1e0daac9575e2b1ba7e46c9ced5117b7fe639a1e	in the current study , we investigated the nans - and nans - p - mediated digestion of synthetic o - acetylated neuraminic acids and bovine submaxillary glands mucin ( bsm)-derived o - acetylneuraminic acids by high - performance thin - layer chromatography ( hptlc ) and
1e0daac9575e2b1ba7e46c9ced5117b7fe639a1e	however , all tested enzymes were unable to de - o - acetylate 5-n - acetyl-4-o - acetylneuraminic acid ( neu5,4 ac 2 ) in our test system .

1e0daac9575e2b1ba7e46c9ced5117b7fe639a1e	this enzyme activity leads to neuraminidase - accessible neu5ac and neu5gc on mucin glycans .
1e0daac9575e2b1ba7e46c9ced5117b7fe639a1e	moreover , we could demonstrate by hptlc analyses that recombinant bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase ( btsa - his ) was able to cleave neu5ac and neu5,9ac 2 from bsm and that the combination of btsa - his with both nans - his and nans - p - his derivatives enhanced the release of de - o - acetylated core neu5ac and neu5gc from mammalian mucin o - glycans .
1e0daac9575e2b1ba7e46c9ced5117b7fe639a1e	thus , we hypothesize that the expression of sialic acid o - acetylesterases with a broad specificity could be an advantage in competition with the gut microbiota for nutrients and facilitate ehec colonization in the human large intestine .

d23d595a611c443a1943295f9bd31c98117fd930	the covid-19 pandemic has plagued the world for months .

6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	although nitric oxide ( no ) has been postulated to be a mediator of endotoxic or septic shock , a signi ~ cant body of evidence has accumulated that is inconsistent with this notion .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	therefore , the purpose of this chapter will be to present evidence showing that not only is there a reasonable doubt about many of the tenets underpinning the no hypothesis , but that considerable data exist showing that no actually counteracts the pathophysiology of shock states .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	i will discuss ~ ve key suppositions regarding the role of nitric oxide as a key mediator of endotoxic or septic shock .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	nitric oxide levels reach such high values that they exert a constellation of effects which produce and promote shock states including septic shock .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	nitric oxide markedly depresses myocardial contractility , a hallmark of endotoxic or septic shock .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	nitric oxide synthase ( nos ) inhibitors counteract the hemodynamic sequelae of endotoxic shock and improve survival in this state .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	nitric oxide donors aggravate endotoxic or septic shock .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	peroxynitrite , not nitric oxide , is the real culprit mediating shock states .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	i will present signi ~ cant evidence against each of these ~ ve major suppositions , which when taken together will cast signi ~ cant doubt on the overall hypothesis that no is indeed the mediator of endotoxic or septic shock .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	all these effects are important actions of no necessary for the maintenance of vascular and microcirculatory homeostasis .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	the argument is made that no levels in endotoxic shock are so high , that the vasodilator effects of no spill over into the systemic circulation and produce profound systemic hypotension [ 8 ] .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	secondly , the generally accepted supposition is that no levels in endotoxemic shock exist in the high micromolar range , but this has never been measured .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	in fact , the converse appears to be true , namely that endothelium - derived no ( edno ) is markedly decreased in endotoxemia .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	parker and adams [ 10 ] have shown reduced edno in guinea pig aortic and coronary artery rings , and others have obtained similar results in rat mesenteric arteries [ 11 ] , in dog coronary [ 12 ] , or mesenteric arteries [ 13 ] , and in sheep pulmonary arteries [ 14 ] .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	moreover , myers et al [ 15 ] demonstrated that both edrf activity and no production are directly inhibited by e. coli endotoxin in cultured endothelial cells .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	moreover , blood vessels isolated from endotoxemic animals respond to no releasing agents ( e.g. , nitroglycerin and nano 2 ) , so that it is not a tachyphylaxis to no
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	thirdly , endotoxin is thought to exert many of its effects via release of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor - a ( tnfa ) .
6576af8d530960619e80083817a742cbfb60a838	however , tnfa itself has been shown to reduce no release ( i.e. , impair vasorelaxation to acetylcholine but not to direct vasodilators ) in cat carotid arteries [ 16 ] .

42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	the patient 's headache persisted during hospitalization , and it was only partially responsive to intravenous analgesics ( ketorolac and paracetamol ) .
42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	on day 7 , a brain ct - angiography showed a narrowed eccentric lumen of both internal carotid arteries , particularly on the left side , which started from the distal cervical part and extended towards the entrance into the petrous bone .

42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	he was initially treated with enoxaparin followed by warfarin .
42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	interestingly , the retrospective evaluation of a brain mri performed approximately 1 month before this admission ( as part of low - grade glioma follow - up ) revealed a normal " flow - void " signal on t2 images at the level of the terminal portion of extra - cranial internal carotid artery bilaterally , suggesting that arterial wall dissection occurred in close temporal association with the recent infection .
42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	at discharge ( on day 22 ) , the patient was still in good neurological conditions .
42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	the temporal sequence in this case suggests , but does not prove , that covid-19 represented a triggering factor for cad .
42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	however , a body of epidemiological and clinical evidence suggest that infections , particularly those involving the respiratory tract , may represent a triggering factor for cad
42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	interestingly , the association has been reported stronger for multiple rather than single artery dissection [ 4 ] as in the case here presented .
42797b410c50548a3b8c387cd56852946db093ee	moreover , the absence of other predisposing factors in this patient suggests a potential role of sars - cov-2 as a trigger , even though a history of trauma is lacking in many cases of cad [ 3 , 4 ] .

dd5689c78d84574a170bbc38582908824484137c	emergence of a new variant of spike protein ( d614 g ) with increased infectivity and transmissibility has prompted many to analyze the potential role of this variant in the sars - cov-2 pandemic .
dd5689c78d84574a170bbc38582908824484137c	when a new variant emerges , there is a concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross - reactive immune memory to the second variant .

aa3bf55b8d7c751c5dc8d18c208e8e1fd9064664	these compounds exhibited good selectivity index ( over 70 against mers - cov ) and could lead to the development of broad - spectrum antiviral drugs against emerging covs and picornaviruses .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	despite the availability of an effective prophylactic vaccine leading to sterilizing immunity , hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) is responsible for chronic liver disease in more than 250 million individuals , potentially leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	but they are , by and large , unable to eradicate the virus .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	a constant feature of chronic hbv infection is t - cell exhaustion resulting from persistent exposure to high antigen concentrations as shown by the high expression of programmed cell death protein 1 ( pd-1 ) by hbv - specific cd8 t cells .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	one way of tackling this problem is to develop hbv - specific neutralizing antibodies that would clear excess envelope proteins from the circulation , allowing for nucleos(t)ide analogs or other antiviral drugs now in preclinical and early clinical development to take advantage of a reconstituted adaptive immunity .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	several fully human monoclonal antibodies ( mab ) have been developed from hbv - vaccinated and subjects convalescent from acute hepatitis b that show different properties and specificities .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	it is envisaged that such neutralizing mab may be used as adjuvant treatment to reduce viral protein load , thus rescuing adaptive immunity in an effort to optimize the effect of antiviral drugs .

11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	hepatitis b can be effectively prevented by a prophylactic vaccine ( 2 ) , whereas , antiviral drugs are virtually unable to eradicate the virus in chronically infected individuals despite efficient suppression of hbv dna replication ( 3 ) .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	adaptive immunity plays a major role to provide long - term control of infection ; however , the very low frequency of circulating hbv - specific t cells in chronic infection contributes to the inability to clear the virus ( 4 ) .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	indeed , hbv may settle for life in occult form in the nuclei of hepatocytes as minichromosome ( covalently closed circular dna , cccdna ) , despite apparent recovery , potentially reactivating in case of immune suppression ( 5 ) .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	the persistence of cccdna in hepatocytes is the main hurdle to eradicate hbv infection .
11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642	the problem is further compounded by the rapid decline of t - cell and b - cell responses as a result of exhaustion induced by production of large amounts of excess hbv envelope proteins ( 6 ) , largely resulting from integration of hbv

8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97	a nephropathogenic k2/01 strain of infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) was attenuated by 170 serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs for possible use as a future ibv vaccine strain .
8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97	high - growth properties and narrow tissue tropisms ( limited replication in respiratory tracts ) were achieved by the adaptation process .
8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97	the attenuated strain ( k2p170 ) was safe in day - old specific - pathogen - free chicks since replication of the virus did not induce mortality and nephritis , and rarely induced histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular administration .
8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97	in day - old broilers , even though coarse spray administration of k2p170 induced clinical signs , ciliostasis , and histopathological lesions in the trachea and the kidney , they were all comparable to birds vaccinated with commercial h120 vaccine .
8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97	despite restriction of viral replication in the respiratory tract , k2p170 elicited the production of antiserum with a neutralization index of 4.5 .
8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97	furthermore , k2p170 provided significantly greater cross - protection against two heterologous strains ( massachusetts and korean respiratory strain ) than those conferred by the commercial h120 vaccine .
8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97	k2p170 also had no virulence reversion after five back passages in chickens .
8f3fffb6a99b0baa471ddd963ee04bfa71e1bb97	in conclusion , k2p170 exhibits a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity , possesses cross - protective efficacy , and merits further investigation as a potential live vaccine as an alternative means of protection against the recently emergent nephropathogenic ibv infection in many eurasian countries .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	in this issue of clinical infectious diseases , byington et al report on findings from the big - love
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	based on serial molecular testing for respiratory viruses carried out on a defined population , big - love provides a wealth of information about the relationship between respiratory symptoms and respiratory viral infection .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	the study stands squarely in the tradition of the historic community - based studies of viral respiratory infection , including the cleveland family study [ 2 ] , the tecumseh study [ 3 ] , and the new york and seattle virus watches [ 4 , 5 ] .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	those studies , which were based on viral culture and/or serology , established our current conceptual framework for the community epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infection .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	big - love resembles the classic studies by being community based , with specimens obtained from study participants on a regular basis , regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms , but the study stands out by virtue of the intensity of virologic and clinical surveillance undertaken .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	a total of 108 individuals in 26 households from the university of utah campus community provided symptom diaries and self - collected anterior nasal swab samples weekly for 52 consecutive weeks .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	each week was characterized with regard to occurrence of illness based on the symptom diary and presence or absence of respiratory viruses as measured by the molecular test .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	illness episodes were defined as continuous periods of presence of symptoms , and virus episodes were defined as continuous periods of detection of the same virus .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	molecular detection is rapidly becoming the major method used for detection of respiratory viruses in clinical settings , and big - love provides data that will help clinicians interpret the results of current molecular assays .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	like previous studies [ 6 , 8 ] , big - love documents the impressive frequency of respiratory symptoms and infection with respiratory viruses that are present in the community at any given time .
00a3a4742c565f5e2e64ad03fe0f1e16baee89b3	sixty percent of respiratory illness episodes were associated with detection of 1 or more viruses .

a214c88feb818ad2a630e317c0c148cc3ed6259c	our results quantify the benefits of : ( a ) using contextualized embeddings over fixed word embeddings ; ( b ) using a bilstm - crf architecture with contextualized word embeddings over fine - tuning the contextualized embedding model directly ; and ( c ) using domain - specific contextualized embeddings ( scibert ) .
a214c88feb818ad2a630e317c0c148cc3ed6259c	lastly , we present a case study where we analyze different self - attention layers of the two best models ( bert and scibert ) to better understand their predictions .
4a06a5447ca98fcd8440759402cd3c902a610d3f	to explore the epidemic mode of covid-19 , we made an epidemiological investigation , set up hypothetical models , and compared them with hepatitis a virus ( hav ) age - specific epidemic characteristic .
4a06a5447ca98fcd8440759402cd3c902a610d3f	in the epidemiological investigation , we reported the first familial covid-19 silent infection in the world .
4a06a5447ca98fcd8440759402cd3c902a610d3f	a 19-year - old healthy female covid-19 virus carrier without any symptoms caused two mild and one severe pneumonia .
4a06a5447ca98fcd8440759402cd3c902a610d3f	in comparison with hav , covid-19 shows the same infection mode in children ( aged 0 - 9 years ) , but significant difference in young adults ( aged 10 - 44 years ) and the elderly ( aged 45 years or older ) .
4a06a5447ca98fcd8440759402cd3c902a610d3f	erefore , we prejudged that covid-19 is a silent infection pandemic mainly in young adults but threatens the elderly .

fbc41a8e025cd6eb2d7c156aad3b6923af2349c4	here based on the public single - cell rna - seq datasets , we analyzed the ace2 rna expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract .
fbc41a8e025cd6eb2d7c156aad3b6923af2349c4	the result indicates that the ace2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells .
fbc41a8e025cd6eb2d7c156aad3b6923af2349c4	we found that the size of this population of ace2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ace2-expression type ii alveolar cells ( at2 ) in the asian sample reported by yu zhao et al .
fbc41a8e025cd6eb2d7c156aad3b6923af2349c4	we further detected 2019-ncov by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) from the nasal - swab and throat - swab of seven suspected cases .
fbc41a8e025cd6eb2d7c156aad3b6923af2349c4	we found that 2019-ncov tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal - swab comparing to the throat - swab , which could attribute to the ace2-expressing nasal epithelial cells .
fbc41a8e025cd6eb2d7c156aad3b6923af2349c4	we hope this study could be informative for virus - prevention strategy development , especially the treatment of nasal mucus .
fbc41a8e025cd6eb2d7c156aad3b6923af2349c4	severe infection by 2019-ncov could result in acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and sepsis , causing death in approximately 2 % of infected individuals 1 .

a9c8c00fee3d6865f6df8269d5fd174e89707722	it is suggested that covid-19 associated pe represents in situ immunothrombosis rather than venous thromboembolism , although the origin of thrombotic lesions in covid-19 patients remains largely unknown .
a9c8c00fee3d6865f6df8269d5fd174e89707722	in this study , we assessed the clinical and computed tomography ( ct ) characteristics of pe in 23 consecutive patients with covid-19 pneumonia and compared these to those of 100 consecutive control patients diagnosed with acute pe before the covid-19 outbreak .
a9c8c00fee3d6865f6df8269d5fd174e89707722	specifically , rv / lv diameter ratio , pulmonary artery trunk diameter and total thrombus load ( according to qanadli ) were measured and compared .
a9c8c00fee3d6865f6df8269d5fd174e89707722	we observed that all thrombotic lesions in covid-19 patients were found to be in lung parenchyma affected by covid-19 .
a9c8c00fee3d6865f6df8269d5fd174e89707722	also , the thrombus load was lower in covid-19 patients ( qanadli score -8 % , 95 % confidence interval [ 95%ci ] -16 to -0.36 % ) as was the prevalence of the most proximal pe in the main / lobar pulmonary artery ( 17 % versus 47 % ; -30 % , 95%ci -44 % to -8.2 ) .
a9c8c00fee3d6865f6df8269d5fd174e89707722	moreover , the mean rv / lv ratio ( mean difference -0.23 , 95%ci -0.39 to -0.07 ) and the prevalence of rv / lv ratio > 1.0 ( prevalence difference -23 % , 95%ci -41 to -0.86 % ) were lower in the covid-19 patients .
fe96465c506e69345e10773221f72b871b4e742f	the identification of dystrophin and the causative role of mutations in this gene in duchenne and becker muscular dystrophies ( d / bmd ) was expected to lead to timely development of effective therapies .
fe96465c506e69345e10773221f72b871b4e742f	despite over 20 years of research , corticosteroids remain the only available pharmacological treatment for dmd , although significant benefits and extended life have resulted from advances in the clinical care and management of dmd individuals .
fe96465c506e69345e10773221f72b871b4e742f	effective treatment of dmd will require dystrophin restitution in skeletal , cardiac , and smooth muscles and nonmuscle tissues ; however , modulation of muscle loss and regeneration has the potential to play an important role in altering the natural history of dmd , particularly in combination with other treatments .
fe96465c506e69345e10773221f72b871b4e742f	emerging biological , molecular , and small molecule therapeutics are showing promise in ameliorating this devastating disease , and it is anticipated that regulatory environments will need to display some flexibility in order to accommodate the new treatment paradigms .
34694791cd158e785ad16404d5d34ad8559792c0	recently a number of publications looked at the association between covid-19 morbidity and mortality on one hand and countries ' policies with respect to bcg vaccination on the other .
34694791cd158e785ad16404d5d34ad8559792c0	this connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where bcg vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place .
34694791cd158e785ad16404d5d34ad8559792c0	meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that bcg vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates .
34694791cd158e785ad16404d5d34ad8559792c0	it suggests that bcg vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors , such as population age , ethnicity , rates of certain chronic diseases , time from community spread start date , major public policy decisions and income levels .

e8d53e5527ae6c362e16b85de85a53cc3486f72f	our early work revealed that cerebral compression elicits severe hemorrhagic pulmonary edema ( pe ) , leading to central sympathetic activation that results in systemic vasoconstriction .
e8d53e5527ae6c362e16b85de85a53cc3486f72f	vasodilators , but not oxidant radical scavengers , are effective in the prevention of centrogenic pe .

e8d53e5527ae6c362e16b85de85a53cc3486f72f	although no is important in maintaining vasodilator tone , hypoxiainduced pulmonary vasoconstriction is accompanied by an increase instead of a decrease in no release .
e8d53e5527ae6c362e16b85de85a53cc3486f72f	in animal and isolated lung studies , endotoxin produces acute lung injury that is associated with increases in cytokines and inducible nos mrna expression , suggesting that no is toxic to the lung in endotoxin shock .
e8d53e5527ae6c362e16b85de85a53cc3486f72f	recently , we reported several rare cases that indicate that ards in patients with japanese b encephalitis , lymphangitis with breast cancer and fat embolism is caused by different mechanisms .
e8d53e5527ae6c362e16b85de85a53cc3486f72f	our early and recent studies on ards and pe may provide information for clinical practice and the understanding of the pathogenesis of sars .
e2e611fe5040e3f923577891bbd11ca5192300ea	for the past several decades , the infectious disease profile in china has been shifting with rapid developments in social and economic aspects , environment , quality of food , water , housing , and public health infrastructure .
e2e611fe5040e3f923577891bbd11ca5192300ea	notably , 5 notifiable infectious diseases have been almost eradicated , and the incidence of 18 additional notifiable infectious diseases has been significantly reduced .
e2e611fe5040e3f923577891bbd11ca5192300ea	unexpectedly , the incidence of over 10 notifiable infectious diseases , including hiv , brucellosis , syphilis , and dengue fever , has been increasing .
e2e611fe5040e3f923577891bbd11ca5192300ea	nevertheless , frequent infectious disease outbreaks / events have been reported almost every year , and imported infectious diseases have increased since 2015 .
e2e611fe5040e3f923577891bbd11ca5192300ea	some infectious diseases seem to be exacerbated by various factors , including rapid urbanization , large numbers of migrant workers , changes in climate , ecology , and policies , such as returning farmland to forests .
e2e611fe5040e3f923577891bbd11ca5192300ea	this review summarizes the current experiences and lessons from china in managing emerging and re - emerging infectious diseases , especially the effects of ecology , climate , and behavior , which should have merits in helping other countries to control and prevent infectious diseases .
f7d3bb24344d0bfacd46da8b08d26206d057bbaf	rumors and conspiracy theories thrive in environments of low confidence and low trust .
f7d3bb24344d0bfacd46da8b08d26206d057bbaf	consequently , it is not surprising that covid-19 related rumors and conspiracy theories are proliferating .
f7d3bb24344d0bfacd46da8b08d26206d057bbaf	this phenomenon is particularly acute given the lack of any authoritative scientific consensus on the virus , its spread and containment , or on the long term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic .
f7d3bb24344d0bfacd46da8b08d26206d057bbaf	among the stories currently circulating on social media and in the news are ones suggesting that the 5 g network activates the virus or causes physiological change that can kill , that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal , that the virus is a bio - weapon released deliberately by the chinese , or that bill gates is using the pandemic to launch a global surveillance regime under cover of vaccination .
f7d3bb24344d0bfacd46da8b08d26206d057bbaf	while some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real - world behavior , recent events including the destruction of property , racially fueled attacks against asian americans , and demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders countermand such conclusions .
f7d3bb24344d0bfacd46da8b08d26206d057bbaf	rumors and conspiracy theories about the pandemic pose a significant threat not only to democratic institutions such as a free , open and trusted press , but also to the physical well - being of the citizenry .
f7d3bb24344d0bfacd46da8b08d26206d057bbaf	understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread .
11546fd9eb91409d86021069162e2af02f43ba63	with the help of confocal and 3d ultrastructural imaging together with molecular mapping in situ and in vitro we have characterized a tubular structure that harbours the viral replication complexes in a globular domain .
11546fd9eb91409d86021069162e2af02f43ba63	i were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting in isolated tubes while actin and the viral nsm non - structural protein were detected in the tubes ' internal proteinaceous scaffold by immunogold labelling .
11546fd9eb91409d86021069162e2af02f43ba63	studies with nsm deletion mutants and drugs affecting actin showed that both nsm and actin are key factors for tube and virus assembly in golgi .
11546fd9eb91409d86021069162e2af02f43ba63	three - dimensional reconstructions based on oriented serial sections of infected cells showed that tubes anchor cell organelles to golgi stacks and make contacts with intracellular viruses .
11546fd9eb91409d86021069162e2af02f43ba63	we propose that this new structure , unique among enveloped viruses , assembles in association with the most stable component of golgi stacks , the actincontaining matrix scaffold , connecting viral replication and morphogenesis inside viral factories .
537dfa53dd0d134f1f89ddced5df581347880bd0	lipoprotein lipase ( lpl ) is upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions and it may promote the progression of atherosclerosis , but the mechanisms behind this process are not completely understood .
537dfa53dd0d134f1f89ddced5df581347880bd0	we previously showed that the phosphorylation of akt within thp-1 macrophages is increased in response to the lipid hydrolysis products generated by lpl from total lipoproteins .
537dfa53dd0d134f1f89ddced5df581347880bd0	we further show that the total ffa component , and specifically palmitoleate , reduces apolipoprotein a - i - mediated cholesterol efflux , and that the reduction can be reversed in the presence of the akt inhibitor mk-2206 .
537dfa53dd0d134f1f89ddced5df581347880bd0	overall , our data support a negative role for the ffa component of lipoprotein hydrolysis products generated by lpl , by impairing macrophage cholesterol efflux via akt activation .

bba54a43464e4fda9280139894c5467524ef2faf	here , we report a rationally designed novel hiv-1 fusion inhibitor derived from chr - derived peptide ( trp628~gln653 , named cp ) , but with an innovative ile - asp - leu tail ( idl ) that dramatically increased the inhibitory activity by up to 100 folds .
bba54a43464e4fda9280139894c5467524ef2faf	although the overall structures of both fusion peptides share the canonical six - helix bundle ( 6-hb ) configuration , their idl tails adopt two different conformations : a one - turn helix with the n36 , and a hook - like structure with the longer n43 .
bba54a43464e4fda9280139894c5467524ef2faf	structural comparison showed that the hook - like idl tail possesses a larger interaction interface with nhr than the helical one .
bba54a43464e4fda9280139894c5467524ef2faf	further molecular dynamics simulations of the two 6-hbs and isolated cp - idl peptides suggested that hook - like form of idl tail can be stabilized by its binding to nhr trimer .
bba54a43464e4fda9280139894c5467524ef2faf	therefore , cp - idl has potential for further development as a new hiv fusion inhibitor , and this strategy could be widely used in developing artificial fusion inhibitors against hiv and other enveloped viruses .

0e1a632726d014fa7aecdce861f6a9c477233e47	the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has recently spread globally and is now a pandemic .
53a6b0500d2b30192fa3f0bf91d16ac8c1bec5d9	between 2003 and 2009 , the prevalence of extensively drug - resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa ( xdr - pa ) increased significantly in northern taiwan from 1.0 % to 2.1 % .
3ba2641160cb0acdca16991443017f11d2d848c2	vaccination is highly effective in preventing various infectious diseases , whereas the constant threat of new emerging pathogens necessitates the development of innovative vaccination principles that also confer rapid protection in a case of emergency .
3ba2641160cb0acdca16991443017f11d2d848c2	although increasing evidence points to t cell immunity playing a critical role in vaccination against viral diseases , vaccine efficacy is mostly associated with the induction of antibody responses .
3ba2641160cb0acdca16991443017f11d2d848c2	here we analyze the immunological mechanism(s ) of rapidly protective vaccinia virus immunization using mousepox as surrogate model for human smallpox .
3ba2641160cb0acdca16991443017f11d2d848c2	we found that fast protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended on cd4 and cd8 t cell responses induced by vaccination with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara ( mva ) or conventional vaccinia virus .
3ba2641160cb0acdca16991443017f11d2d848c2	in contrast , selected components of the innate immune system and b cellmediated responses were fully dispensable for prevention of fatal disease by immunization given two days before challenge .
3ba2641160cb0acdca16991443017f11d2d848c2	in conclusion , our data clearly demonstrate that perforin - dependent cd8 t cell immunity plays a key role in mva conferred short term protection against lethal mousepox .

0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	the 90 kda ribosomal s6 kinases ( p90rsks ) are a family of broadly expressed serine / threonine kinases with two kinase domains activated by extracellular signal - regulated protein kinase in response to many growth factors .
0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	our recent study demonstrated that severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars)coronavirus ( cov ) infection of monkey kidney vero e6 cells induces phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of signaling pathways , resulting in apoptosis .
0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	in the present study , we investigated the phosphorylation status of p90rsk , which is a wellknown substrate of these signaling pathways , in sars - cov - infected cells .
0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	in the absence of viral infection , ser221 in the n - terminal kinase domain was phosphorylated constitutively , whereas both thr573 in the c - terminal kinase domain and ser380 between the two kinase domains were not phosphorylated in confluent cells .
0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	ser380 , which has been reported to be involved in autophosphorylation by activation of the c - terminal kinase domain , was phosphorylated in confluent sars - covinfected cells , and this phosphorylation was inhibited by sb203580 , which is an inhibitor of p38 mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapk ) .
0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	phosphorylation of thr573 was not upregulated in sars - cov - infected cells .
0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	thus , in virus - infected cells , phosphorylation of thr573 was not necessary to induce phosphorylation of ser380 .
0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	on the other hand , both thr573 and ser380 were phosphorylated by treatment with epidermal growth factor ( egf ) in the absence of p38 mapk activation .
0f41ee18e9b579097b165fe0790bd07c4febcf08	these results indicated that phosphorylation status of p90rsk by sars - cov infection is different from that by stimulation of egf .

fc81b13024b83488ca628123c21170ac836fb5fe	such a vaccine would need to rapidly confer protection after one or two doses and would need to be manufactured using components suitable for scale - up .
fc81b13024b83488ca628123c21170ac836fb5fe	here , we developed an alphavirus - derived replicon rna vaccine candidate , reprna - cov2s , encoding the sars - cov-2 spike ( s ) protein .
fc81b13024b83488ca628123c21170ac836fb5fe	the rna replicons were formulated with lipid inorganic nanoparticles ( lion ) that were designed to enhance vaccine stability , delivery , and immunogenicity .
fc81b13024b83488ca628123c21170ac836fb5fe	we show that a single intramuscular injection of the lion / reprna - cov2s vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti - sars - cov-2 s protein igg antibody isotypes indicative of a type 1 t helper cell response .
fc81b13024b83488ca628123c21170ac836fb5fe	a prime / boost regimen induced potent t cell responses in mice including antigen - specific responses in lung and spleen .

7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	the type i interferon ( ifn ) system is a first line of defense against viral infections .
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	viruses have developed various mechanisms to counteract this response .
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	so far , the interferon antagonistic activity of influenza a viruses was mainly observed on the level of ifnb gene induction via action of the viral non - structural protein 1 ( ns1 ) .
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	here we present data indicating that influenza a viruses not only suppress ifnb gene induction but also inhibit type
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	i ifn signaling through a mechanism involving induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 ( socs-3 ) protein .
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	our study was based on the observation that in cells that were infected with influenza a virus and subsequently stimulated with ifna / b , phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 ( stat1 ) was strongly reduced .
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	closer examination revealed that socs-3 but not socs-1 mrna levels increase in an rna - and nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kb)-dependent but type i ifn - independent manner early in the viral replication cycle .
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	and protein expression appears to be relevant for suppression of the antiviral response since in socs-3 deficient cells a sustained phosphorylation of stat1 correlated with elevated expression of type i ifn - dependent genes .
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	as a consequence , progeny virus titers were reduced in socs-3 deficient cells or in cells were socs-3 expression was knocked - down by sirna .
7ee508ec11743a3ef6f496edaee487e68ace2368	these data provide the first evidence that influenza a viruses suppress type i ifn signaling on the level of jak / stat activation .

e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3	besides severe respiratory distress , recent reports in covid-19 patients have found a strong association between platelet counts and patient survival .
e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3	in this study , through an integrated analysis of bulk rna - sequencing data from covid-19 patients with data from single - cell sequencing studies on lung tissues , we found that most of the cell - types that contributed to the altered gene expression were of hematopoietic origin .
e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3	we also found that differentially expressed genes in covid-19 patients formed a significant pool of the expressing genes in phagocytic cells such as monocytes and platelets .

e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3	we identified more than 20 genes that change in the same direction between covid-19 infection and aging cells that may act as potential therapeutic targets .
e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3	to understand whether infection can directly manipulate the biology of monocytes and platelets , we hypothesize that these non - ace2 expressing cells may be infected by the virus through the phagocytic route .
e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3	we observed that phagocytic cells such as monocytes , t - cells , and platelets have a significantly higher expression of genes that are a part of the covid-19 viral interactome .
e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3	hence these cell - types may have an active rather than a reactive role in viral pathogenesis to manifest clinical symptoms such as coagulopathy .
e4aba10644c506726280ab44052c37976a84c5f3	therefore , our results present molecular evidence for pursuing both anti - inflammatory and anticoagulation therapy for better patient management especially in older patients .

ff2e6962ae80b7f17be32dd59513bdeb3a2d6e92	this case emphasizes the importance of ensuring that first - line health care providers , including ophthalmologists , optometrists , emergency physicians , and family physicians , consider covid-19 on the differential for any patient with recent travel who presents with acute conjunctivitis .
ff2e6962ae80b7f17be32dd59513bdeb3a2d6e92	having a high index of suspicion with this presentation would allow for appropriate precautions to be taken to prevent further spread of covid-19 .
9c452fc8e4bba61bdc42891a0520e87c1c38b7f5	the enduring outbreak of the corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) originated from china illustrates global concerns owing to their infective nature and time - consuming incubation .

d9c10cc9cfcc515e570dc8523262c88c0d4ccdc7	the recent sars - cov-2 pandemic , which has recently affected italy since february 21 , constitutes a threat to normal subjects , as the coronavirus disease-19 ( covid-19 ) can manifest with a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia or even death .
d9c10cc9cfcc515e570dc8523262c88c0d4ccdc7	there is evidence that older age and several comorbidities can affect the risk to develop severe pneumonia and possibly the need of mechanic ventilation in subjects infected with sars - cov-2 .
d9c10cc9cfcc515e570dc8523262c88c0d4ccdc7	therefore , we evaluated the outcome of sars - cov-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity ( iei ) such as x - linked agammaglobulinemia ( xla ) .
d9c10cc9cfcc515e570dc8523262c88c0d4ccdc7	when the sars - cov-2 epidemic has reached italy , we have activated a surveillance protocol of patients with iei , to perform sars - cov-2 search by nasopharyngeal swab in patients presenting with symptoms that could be a manifestation of covid-19 , such as fever , cough , diarrhea , or vomiting .
d9c10cc9cfcc515e570dc8523262c88c0d4ccdc7	we describe two patients with x - linked agammaglobulinemia ( xla ) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of b cells from peripheral blood who developed covid-19 , as diagnosed by sars - cov-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab , while receiving immunoglobulin infusions .
d9c10cc9cfcc515e570dc8523262c88c0d4ccdc7	both patients developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by fever , cough , and anorexia and associated with elevation of crp and ferritin , but have never required oxygen ventilation or intensive care .
d9c10cc9cfcc515e570dc8523262c88c0d4ccdc7	our report suggests that xla patients might present with high risk to develop pneumonia after sars - cov-2 infection , but can recover from infection , suggesting that b - cell response might be important , but is not strictly required to overcome the disease .

5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	( tii ) cells have traditionally been considered the immune cells of the alveolar epithelium , as they possess immunomodulatory functions ; however , the precise role of alveolar type
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	i ( ti ) cells , which comprise , 95 % of the alveolar epithelial surface area , in lung immunity is not clear .
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	ti cells isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting ( facs ) from lps - injured rats
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	demonstrated greater fold - induction of multiple inflammatory mediators than tii cells isolated in the same manner from the same animals .
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	tnf - a , il-6 and il-1b from cultured primary rat ti cells after lps stimulation were significantly increased compared to similarly studied primary rat tii cells .
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	we found that contrary to published reports , cultured tii cells produce relatively small amounts of tnf - a , il-6 and il-1b after lps treatment ; the higher levels of cytokine expression from cultured tii cells reported in the literature were likely from macrophage contamination due to traditional non - facs tii cell isolation methods .
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	co - culture of tii cells with macrophages prior to lps stimulation increased tnf - a and il-6
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	production to levels reported by other investigators for tii cells , however , co - culture of ti cells and macrophages prior to lps treatment resulted in marked increases in tnf - a and il-6 production .
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	finally , exogenous surfactant blunted the il-6 response to lps in cultured ti cells .
5efae4eb4c986da7483e7628d420be2a29df90d0	taken together , these findings advocate a role for ti cells in the innate immune response and suggest that both ti and tii cells are active players in host defense mechanisms in the lung .
4ca24acb1b198b40e74baa74a97067562417e7fc	one of the main challenges of the measures against the covid-19 epidemic is to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak without increasing without control its timescale .
4ca24acb1b198b40e74baa74a97067562417e7fc	this allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size , the timescale and the speed of the epidemics , by reducing the infection rate α and by increasing the removal rate β by a factor of λ .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	highly contagious pustular skin infections of sheep , goats and cattle that were unwittingly transmitted to humans from close contact with infected animals , have been the scourge of shepherds , herdsmen and dairy farmers for centuries .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	in more recent times we recognise that these proliferative pustular lesions are likely to be caused by a group of zoonotic viruses that are classified as parapoxviruses .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	like other poxviruses , the central core of the genomes encode factors for virus transcription and replication , and structural proteins , whereas the terminal regions encode accessory factors that give the parapoxvirus group many of its unique features .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	several genes of parapoxviruses are unique to this genus and encode factors that target inflammation , the innate immune responses and the development of acquired immunity .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	the ability of this group to reinfect their hosts , even though a cell - mediated memory response is induced during primary infection , may be related to their epitheliotropic niche and the immunomodulators they produce .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	in this highly localised environment , the secreted immunomodulators only interfere with the local immune response and thus do not compromise the host 's immune system .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	the discovery of a vascular endothelial growth factor - like gene may explain the highly vascular nature of parapoxvirus lesions .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	there are many genes of parapoxviruses which do not encode polypeptides with significant matches with protein sequences in public databases , separating this genus from most other mammalian poxviruses .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	these genes appear to be involved in inhibiting apoptosis , manipulating cell cycle progression and degradation of cellular proteins that may be involved in the stress response , thus allowing the virus to subvert intracellular antiviral mechanisms and enhance the availability of cellular molecules required for replication .
a99af59d6b67a8beafab033e03c9fd684d188ee3	parapoxviruses in common with molluscum contagiosum virus lack a number of genes that are highly conserved in other poxviruses , including factors for nucleotide metabolism , serine protease inhibitors and kelch - like proteins .

1e0a165313e080137556cb75b1af2bb0f6984d9f	although chronic underlying conditions are major determinants of severe respiratory virus infections , few data about coronavirus - related pneumonia in immunocompromised patients are available .
1e0a165313e080137556cb75b1af2bb0f6984d9f	here we report 2 well - documented cases of pneumonia related to coronavirus 229e , each with a different clinical presentation .
1e0a165313e080137556cb75b1af2bb0f6984d9f	diagnosis was made on the basis of viral culture and electron microscopy findings that exhibited typical crown - like particles and through amplification of the viral genome by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction .
1e0a165313e080137556cb75b1af2bb0f6984d9f	on the basis of this report , coronaviruses should be considered as potential causative microorganisms of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients .

5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0	certain simian immunodeficiency viruses ( sivcpz , sivsm ) have demonstrated tremendous success in infecting new species , including humans , resulting in the hiv-1 and hiv-2 epidemics .
5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0	although siv diversification has been studied on a population level , the essential substrates for cross - species transmission , namely siv sequence diversity and the types and extent of viral diversification present in individual reservoir animals have not been elucidated .
5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0	to characterize this intra - host siv diversity , we performed sequence analyses of clonal viral envelope ( env ) v1v2 and gag p27 variants present in individual sivsm - infected sooty mangabeys over time .
5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0	sivsm demonstrated extensive intra - animal v1v2 length variation and amino acid diversity ( le38 % ) , and continual variation in v1v2 n - linked glycosylation consensus sequence frequency and location .
5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0	temporal sequence shifts suggested continual selection , likely due to evolving antibody responses .
5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0	in contrast , gag p27 was predominantly under purifying selection .
5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0	positive diversifying selection in this natural reservoir host is the engine that has driven the evolution of the uniquely adaptable siv / hiv envelope protein .
5208ab18e0b8b851eabda0c5c83c1d31156da8e0	these studies emphasize the importance of retroviral diversification within individual host reservoir animals as a critical substrate in facilitating cross - species transmission .

51f7a2d28b34ee4c56be8e7190d40cfa4f91dd28	detection of infectious viral agents has been on the increase globally with the advent and usage of more sensitive and selective novel molecular techniques in the epidemiological study of viral diseases of economic importance to the swine industry .
51f7a2d28b34ee4c56be8e7190d40cfa4f91dd28	in the last one decade , not less than ten novel swine - infecting viruses have been added to the subfamily , and ceaseless efforts have been in top gear to determine the occurrence and prevalence of the old and new swine parvoviruses in herds of pig - producing countries worldwide .
51f7a2d28b34ee4c56be8e7190d40cfa4f91dd28	the story , however , is on the contrary on the african continent as there is presently a dearth of information on surveillance initiatives of the viruses among swine herds of pig - producing countries in the region .
51f7a2d28b34ee4c56be8e7190d40cfa4f91dd28	timely detection and characterization of the viral pathogens is highly imperative for the implementation of effective control and prevention of its spread .
51f7a2d28b34ee4c56be8e7190d40cfa4f91dd28	this review therefore presents a concise overview on the epidemiology of novel porcine parvoviruses globally and also provides up - to - date highlights on the reported cases of the viral agents in the african sub - region .

265a27e92014958181101d1832dc872006b7c25c	while main research in anomaly detection uses performance metrics , anomaly detection using functional behaviour is still lacking in depth analysis .
265a27e92014958181101d1832dc872006b7c25c	in this paper we show how a boosted ensemble of long short term memory classifiers can detect anomalies in the 5 g radio access network system logs .

5a3543e4cec9c6324987fc3bb0843ab28bb0b180	in order to examine effects of an individual movement and spatial control measures on a disease outbreak , we developed a multiscale model and extended the semi - stochastic simulation method by linking individual movements to pathogen 's diffusion , linking the slow dynamics for disease transmission at the population level to the fast dynamics for pathogen shedding / excretion at the individual level .
5a3543e4cec9c6324987fc3bb0843ab28bb0b180	numerical simulations indicate that during a disease outbreak individuals with the same infection status show the property of clustering and , in particular , individuals ' rapid movements lead to an increase in the average reproduction number r 0 , the final size and the peak value of the outbreak .
5a3543e4cec9c6324987fc3bb0843ab28bb0b180	further , we obtained that either high diffusion rate of the pathogen or frequent environmental clearance lead to a decline in the total number of infected individuals , indicating the need for control measures such as improving air circulation or environmental hygiene .
5a3543e4cec9c6324987fc3bb0843ab28bb0b180	we found that the level of spatial heterogeneity when implementing control greatly affects the control efficacy , and in particular , an uniform isolation strategy leads to low a final size and small peak , compared with local measures , indicating that a large - scale isolation strategy with frequent clearance of the environment is beneficial for disease control .

c851e8a17951dc6f713c2a832e6a516f72154a79	migration of pmns to the cns coincided with increased expression of transcripts specific for the cxcr2 elr - positive chemokine ligands cxcl1 , cxcl2 , and cxcl5 within the brain .

c851e8a17951dc6f713c2a832e6a516f72154a79	correspondingly , cxcr2 neutralization resulted in diminished infiltration of virus - specific t cells , an inability to control viral replication within the brain , and 100 % mortality .
c851e8a17951dc6f713c2a832e6a516f72154a79	blocking cxcr2 signaling did not impair the generation of virus - specific t cells , indicating that cxcr2 is not required to tailor anti - jhmv t cell responses .
c851e8a17951dc6f713c2a832e6a516f72154a79	evaluation of mice in which cxcr2 is genetically silenced ( cxcr22/2 mice ) confirmed that pmns neither expressed cxcr2 nor migrated in response to ligands cxcl1 , cxcl2 , or cxcl5 in an in vitro chemotaxis assay .
c851e8a17951dc6f713c2a832e6a516f72154a79	moreover , jhmv infection of cxcr22/2 mice resulted in an approximate 60 % reduction of pmn migration into the cns , yet these mice survived infection and controlled viral replication within the brain .
c851e8a17951dc6f713c2a832e6a516f72154a79	treatment of jhmv - infected cxcr22/2 mice with anti - cxcr2 antibody did not modulate pmn migration nor alter viral clearance or mortality , indicating the existence of compensatory mechanisms that facilitate sufficient migration of pmns into the cns in the absence of cxcr2 .
c851e8a17951dc6f713c2a832e6a516f72154a79	collectively , these findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for elr - positive chemokines in enhancing host defense during acute viral infections of the cns .

592c1efd20dcb1ff5644f5d20e76f2c28a2b8da0	in summary , hpv16 psv - encapsidated dna delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against hpv and primed for antibody and t - cell responses to rsv antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids .
592c1efd20dcb1ff5644f5d20e76f2c28a2b8da0	although the immunogenicity of the dna component was just above the dose response threshold , the hpv - specific immunity was robust .
592c1efd20dcb1ff5644f5d20e76f2c28a2b8da0	taken together , these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized hpv psv could provide a practical , thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation .

df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	this paper introduces a novel method of spectrum sensing in communication systems that utilizes nonuniform sampling in conjunction with a suitable spectral analysis tool .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	it is referred to here as spectral analysis for randomized sampling ( sars ) .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	owing to the deployment of nonuniform sampling , the proposed technique can accomplish the sensing task by using sampling rates well below the ones demanded by uniform - sampling - based digital signal processing ( dsp ) .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	the effect of the cyclostationary nature of the incoming digital communication signal on the adequacy of the adopted periodogram - type estimator for the spectrum sensing operation is addressed .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	general reliability conditions on the length of the required signal observation window , i.e. sensing time , for a chosen sampling rate or vice versa are provided amid a sought system performance .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	this paper establishes a new framework for efficient spectrum sensing where considerable savings on the sampling rate and number of processed samples can be attained .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	whilst the aforementioned methods deal with arbitrary nonuniform sampling , the approach proposed here relies on the ability of the user to prescribe the positions of the sampling instants , i.e. randomized sampling and hence sars .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	the earliest papers on dasp , e.g. [ 21 , 22 ] , tackled sars with the aim of estimating the signal 's power spectral density ( psd ) of wide sense stationary ( wss ) signals ; however the predicament of the estimators ' accuracies for a finite number of samples was not resolved .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	in this study , the characteristics and spectrum sensing capabilities of a spectral analysis method that uses a finite set of samples captured at low rate are investigated .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	the emphasis of the paper is therefore on reliable spectrum sensing rather than on estimating the exact psd of the processed signal .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	in [ 24 ] , we investigated spectrum sensing of wss signals using sars where transmissions over the system subbands are presumed to be of equal power levels .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	here , digital communication signals , which are modeled as cyclostationary processes , are analyzed and the scenario where the conveyed transmissions are of different power levels , e.g. due to the propagation channel gain , is considered .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	the reliability of detection is expressed in terms of the widely embraced receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) in lieu of a general metric , i.e. chebychev 's inequality parameter as in [ 24 ] .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	in [ 27 ] , gardner exposed the defects of such practices in an attempt to correct any errors incurred .

df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	we introduce a noncooperative multiband spectrum sensing method based on the spectral analysis of the incoming signal from a finite set of its nonuniformly distributed noisy samples .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	compared to the classical uniform - sampling - based dsp , the proposed approach can offer substantial savings on the sampling rates and number of processed samples .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	within this framework , we present the statistical characteristics of a periodogram - type estimator that uses the total random sampling ( trs ) scheme .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	the impact of the cyclostationary / nonstationary nature of the processed signal on sars is studied .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	a spectral fragment within each transmission band , referred to as the " guarded region " where the estimator serves as a suitable sensing tool independent of the position of the time analysis window , is identified .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	the sensing reliability is defined in terms of the probability of detection and false alarm for each of the monitored subbands .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	it is demonstrated that these probabilities are closely related to the average sampling rate , sensing time , spectrum utilization , relative powers of active subbands and signal to noise ratio .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	we provide a lower limit on the first two parameters from the latter list such that the reliability of spectrum sensing is guaranteed ; it represents a means to assess the trade - off between the required sampling rate and the sensing time .
df36ea5a235a42dde7cdbc618e4159d888ddba07	the advantages of the introduced technique over the conventional uniform sampling ones are discussed .

b8e27157696f03be645fffb376a079fa1f8117b4	the features of the reactions to treatment were a protracted build - up of local symptoms and minor epistaxis .

b8e27157696f03be645fffb376a079fa1f8117b4	previous experiments had also shown this dose to be insufficient to protect against experimental rhinovirus challenge .
b8e27157696f03be645fffb376a079fa1f8117b4	the dose of interferon that appeared to protect against virus infection caused significant unwanted effects .
b8e27157696f03be645fffb376a079fa1f8117b4	it is essential to find interferon preparations with less inflammatory activity before interferon can be considered for use as a long - term prophylactic against the common cold .

45ca49b78fd033c5e37ec5482918b446f5841c93	about 20 % ( 197 ) of the hybridomas specific for tge virus produced neutralizing mabs specific for site a , which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants .
45ca49b78fd033c5e37ec5482918b446f5841c93	a total of 11 epitopes were defined in e2 glycoprotein , eight of which were critical for virus neutralization .
45ca49b78fd033c5e37ec5482918b446f5841c93	neutralizing mabs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice , although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native , denatured , or mixtures of native and denatured form .
45ca49b78fd033c5e37ec5482918b446f5841c93	the antigenic structure of the ezglycoprotein has been defined with murine mabs , but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine , the natural host of the virus , because porcine sera reacted against these sites .
45ca49b78fd033c5e37ec5482918b446f5841c93	tge virus site c reacted to non - immune porcine sera .
45ca49b78fd033c5e37ec5482918b446f5841c93	these results indicated that tge virus contains epitope(s ) also present in some non - immunoglobulin component of porcine serum .
18527a0c5d7765f40c616c340a394d4ee166b782	in contrast to conventional fluorescent polymers featured by large conjugation structures , a new class of fluorescent polymers without above conjugations are gaining constant interest owing to their significant academic importance and promising applications in diverse fields .
18527a0c5d7765f40c616c340a394d4ee166b782	here we report our recent study on polyurea , prepared by a very simple one step precipitation polymerization of toluene diisocyanate in a binary solvent of water - acetone .
18527a0c5d7765f40c616c340a394d4ee166b782	this polyurea , basically consisting of phenyl ring and urea group , shows fluorescent emission in a broad concentration range , from very low ( 10 -5 mg / ml ) to its solubility limit ( 50 mg / ml ) , and in a wide range of emission wavelength from uv to visible regions of up to 500 nm under varied excitation wavelength .
18527a0c5d7765f40c616c340a394d4ee166b782	it was concluded that the emission in uv region was intrinsic due to the conjugation between the phenyl and the adjacent urea unit ; while the emission in visible region , strongly excitation dependent , was caused by the cluster formation of the molecular chains , in accordance with the cluster - triggered - emission ( cte ) mechanism .

388db9cf002b256532f7dd45511dd8357630bcc6	influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus cause acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections , especially in children and the elderly .
388db9cf002b256532f7dd45511dd8357630bcc6	therefore , in this study , real - time reverse transcription loop - mediated isothermal amplification assays with quenching primer for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were developed .
388db9cf002b256532f7dd45511dd8357630bcc6	evaluation of a total of 113 clinical specimens compared to real - time rt - pcr assays showed that the novel assays could distinguish between the types and subtypes of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus and had 100 % diagnostic specificity .
388db9cf002b256532f7dd45511dd8357630bcc6	furthermore , positive results could be obtained in around 15 min using the novel assays in cases with high concentrations of virus .
388db9cf002b256532f7dd45511dd8357630bcc6	the developed assays should be useful for identifying influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus cases not only in experimental laboratories but also in hospital and quarantine laboratories .

4e92a2b9e9b76ebd6976ee318fda7fc71ff4e4e9	thus , while il-12 provides an important positive signal for th1 development , antigen exposure in its absence does not lead to generalized enhancement of type 2 cytokine or antibody responses .
4e92a2b9e9b76ebd6976ee318fda7fc71ff4e4e9	the data argue that endogenous il-12 production is not required as a constitutive negative regulator limiting induction or expression of type 2 effector responses .
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	over the last two decades , the world experienced three outbreaks of coronaviruses with elevated morbidity rates .
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	currently , the global community is facing emerging virus sars - cov-2 belonging to betacoronavirus , which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than sars -
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	the current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by sars - cov-2 .
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	our whole - genome analysis revealed that sars - cov-2 was the descendant of bat sars / sars - like covs and bats served as a natural reservoir .
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	sars - cov-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop , membrane , nucleocapsid , and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent .
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	we confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of sars - cov-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability , allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments .
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	moreover , for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in sars - cov-2 , which encompass spike glycoprotein , rdrp , helicase and orf3a .
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	six recombination regions were spotted in the s gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival , meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host .
55580ce18057340cb976a743521ce12c1cd68055	with these combined natural selected strategies , sars - cov-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society .

98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	acute infectious gastroenteritis cases in shanghai , reported over three years , were analyzed .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	vibrio parahemolyticus and salmonella were the dominant bacteria , and caliciviridae and reoviridae were the dominant viral families in the local area .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	the acute gastroenteritis epidemic peaks appeared in august and january , which represented the active peak periods of bacteria and viruses , respectively .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	showed that abdominal pain , fever and ingestion of unsafe food at restaurants were independent factors more frequently associated with bacterial gastroenteritis irrespective of sex ; red cell - positive fecal matter was associated with bacterial gastroenteritis with an odds ratio ( or ) of 3.28 only in males ; and white blood cell count was associated with bacterial gastroenteritis with an or of 1.02 only in females .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	pathogen stratification showed that age , vomiting and red cell - positive fecal matter were associated with males with ors of 0.99 , 0.61 and 1.71 , respectively , in bacterial gastroenteritis ; and the migrant ratio was higher in males with an or of 2.29 only in viral gastroenteritis .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	in conclusion , although bacterial and viral gastroenteritis shared many features , epidemiological and clinical factors differed between sexes and pathogens .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	acute gastroenteritis is a common disease that is usually caused by viral , bacterial or parasitic infections in the digestive tract 1 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	outbreaks and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis occur throughout the year and pose a major public health burden worldwide 1 - 3 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	most causes of acute gastroenteritis are foodborne or waterborne due to the contamination of a pathogen toxin and/or toxic microorganism 4 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	of the infectious causes of acute gastroenteritis , it is estimated that 50 - 70 % , 15 - 20 % and 10 - 15 % are caused by viral , bacterial and parasitic infections , respectively 1 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	in general , acute viral gastroenteritis peaks in the autumn and winter seasons , and the peak of acute bacterial gastroenteritis appears in summer 1 - 3 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	the main clinical manifestations of acute gastroenteritis are sudden - onset vomiting or diarrhea with or without accompanying nausea , fever , or abdominal pain 4 - 6 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	it is hard for clinicians to differentiate viral gastroenteritis from gastroenteritis caused by bacterial agents on the basis of clinical manifestations alone 7 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	although viral gastroenteritis manifests abruptly with vomiting and watery diarrhea , often accompanied by low - grade fever and abdominal cramps , these clinical manifestations are always shared by bacterial gastroenteritis 6 - 8 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	thus , further evaluation of differences in sex , infection source , transmission route , symptoms as well as clinical laboratory tests between viral and bacterial gastroenteritis has clinical significance .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	in addition , shanghai is an international metropolis that had 24.2 million residents and 320 million tourists in the year of 2017 , and high population density is a major factor promoting acute gastroenteritis epidemics 2,3,9 - 12 .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	so far , long - term acute gastroenteritis surveillance data with a large sample size from shanghai are still scarce .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	furthermore , the pathogenic spectrum of acute infectious gastroenteritis prevalent in the local area remains unclear .
98a359e3f7a754b5145c9e81011981d99ca7eac4	in this report , acute gastroenteritis surveillance data collected over a three - year span from two sentinel hospitals in shanghai are presented .

664b644cac01d4c6bde6468dd7f81757159e97d7	the critical evaluation of all cases suggests that the timing of the administration of tocilizumab , an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist , could be associated with a better efficacy when administered in concomitance to the drop of the oxygen saturation .
664b644cac01d4c6bde6468dd7f81757159e97d7	thus , in sars - cov-2 affected ktrs a close biochemical and clinical monitoring should be set up to allow physicians to hit the virus in the right moment such as a sudden reduction of the oxygen saturation and/or a significant increase of the laboratory values such as d - dimer .

1fd207332d8e23eea77fb6d86263b7e47b9cb822	prrsv infection is associated with an increase in concentrations of haptoglobin , which may interact with the virus receptor ( cd163 ) and induce the synthesis of anti - inflammatory mediators .
1fd207332d8e23eea77fb6d86263b7e47b9cb822	the balance between pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines modulates the expression of cd163 , which may affect the pathogenicity and replication of the virus in different tissues .
1fd207332d8e23eea77fb6d86263b7e47b9cb822	with the emergence of highly pathogenic prrsv , there is a need for more information on the immunopathogenesis of different strains of prrs , particularly to develop more effective vaccines .

9ea1002a17ada9616294ad293210211a35787fce	mouse models of acute hbv pathogenesis , as well as chimpanzees and patients acutely infected with hbv , were used to analyse the role of cd8 +

4c3fdba6c36a829d40a71b3aabf209612ada18b2	since the emerging of the " novel coronavirus " sars - cov-2 and the corresponding respiratory disease covid-19 , the virus has spread all over the world .
4c3fdba6c36a829d40a71b3aabf209612ada18b2	in march 2020 , a " lockdown " was established to contain the virus spread , including the closure of schools and child day care facilities as well as forced social distancing and bans of any public gathering .

9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection control
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) to health care personnel ( hcp ) is a major concern .
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	this study aimed to review cases of mers - related events , such as development of mers - like symptoms or exposure to patients .
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	a mers screening clinic ( msc ) for hcp was setup in the national medical center during the mers outbreak in 2015 .
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	clinical and laboratory data from hcp who visited the msc were retrospectively reviewed .
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	additionally , these data were compared with the results of postoutbreak questionnaire surveys and interviews about mers - related symptoms and risk - related events .
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	of the 333 hcp who participated in mers patient care , 35 hcp ( 10.5 % ) visited the msc for merslike symptoms .
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	no one was infected with mers , and the most common symptom was fever ( 68.6 % )
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	however , 106 of 285 postoutbreak survey participants experienced at least 1 mersrelated symptom and 26 reported exposure to patients without appropriate personal protective equipment , whereas only 4 hcp visited the msc to report exposure events .
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	although a considerable number of hcp experienced mers - related symptoms or unprotected exposure during mers patient care , some did not take appropriate action .
9cc75dfad38021c422145fb2fcb2ea10155fc9a1	these findings imply that for infection control strategy to be properly performed , education should be strengthened so that hcp can accurately recognize the risk situation and properly notify the infection control officer .
7b5230c98f4d93bd25f5f53dd3dd235ec977dfd6	during virus entry , members of the polyomaviridae transit the endolysosomal network en route to the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , from which degraded capsids escape into the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus .
7b5230c98f4d93bd25f5f53dd3dd235ec977dfd6	emerging evidence suggests that viruses require both endosomal acidification and the correct ionic balance of k + and ca 2 + ions in endosomes for correct virus trafficking and genome release .
7b5230c98f4d93bd25f5f53dd3dd235ec977dfd6	here , using two polyomaviruses with different capsid architectures , namely simian virus 40 ( sv40 ) and merkel cell polyomavirus ( mcpyv ) , we describe methods to rapidly quantify virus infection using incucyte zoom imaging analysis , and use this system to investigate the role of both k + and ca 2 + channels during the early stages of virus entry .
7b5230c98f4d93bd25f5f53dd3dd235ec977dfd6	not sv40 can be inhibited by k + channel modulators , whilst both viruses are restricted by the broad spectrum ca 2 + channel inhibitor verapamil .
7b5230c98f4d93bd25f5f53dd3dd235ec977dfd6	using a panel of more specific ca 2 + blockers , we show that both mcpyv and sv40 are dependent on the activity of two - pore ca 2 + channels ( tpcs ) , as the tpc - specific blocker tetrandrine could prevent the capsid disassembly and nuclear transport required for virus entry .
7b5230c98f4d93bd25f5f53dd3dd235ec977dfd6	we therefore reveal a novel target to restrict the entry of polyomaviruses , which given the known role of tpcs during endolysosomal - er fusion , is likely to be applicable to other viruses that transit this pathway .

731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	a short list of uses in just our lab includes the use of gfp in promoter and protein fusions to 1 ) characterize spatial and temporal gene expression patterns ; 2 ) characterize the subcellular distribution of proteins ; 3 ) identify mutations affecting specific cells or processes ; 4 ) label cells
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	applications of these methods to actin filaments , bacterial plasmid segregation protein parm , bacterial and archaeal pili , and bacterial flagellar filaments shows how relatively conserved building blocks ( protein monomers ) can form dramatically different quaternary structures ( polymers ) .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	this suggests that small changes in sequence , with relatively little impact on tertiary structure , can be greatly amplified by large changes in quaternary structure .

731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	however , these length - scales are not available for conventional light microscopy , showing the need for high resolution techniques .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	near - field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom ) is a shearforce based scanning probe technique that uses a sub - wavelength aperture probe to locally excite fluorophores .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	here , we have used two - colour excitation / detection nsom , with a resolution below 100 nm , in aqueous conditions to map with nm accuracy the lfa-1 association with lipid - rafts on cell membranes .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	in the present study we used the fretsensitized acceptor bleaching ( fsab ) technique to quantitate the ratio of erbb1 and erbb2 in heteroclusters .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	in quiescent cells 40 % of erbb1 colocalizes with erbb2 in large - scale clusters , while 10 % of erbb2 coclusters with erbb1 .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	upon egf ( ligand of erbb1 ) stimulation the fraction of erbb2 forming heterocluster with erbb1 increased , while that of erbb1 forming heterocluster with erbb2 decreased .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	the fraction of erbb1 and erbb2 in heteroclusters was independent of the expression level of the receptors .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	in addition , we determine that binding of three generic chromatin - interacting proteins is enhanced in heterochromatin compared to euchromatin .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	finally , we show that these effects of nuclear crowding are best explained by a fractal model of chromatin organization , which allows us to derive a set of chromatin structural parameters that provide a comprehensive framework to predict nuclear protein dynamics .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	acetylation of histone tails is one of the key factors involved in maintenance of chromatin dynamics and cellular homeostasis .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	the hallmark of active chromatin is the hyper - acetylation of histones , which appears to result in a more open chromatin structure .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	using atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , we have analyzed the detailed structure of long hyper - acetylated chromatin fiber .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	hyper - acetylated chromatin fibers isolated from nuclei that had been treated with trichostatin a , inhibitor of histone deacetylase , were found to be thinner than those from untreated nuclei .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	the acetylated chromatin fibers were easier to be spread out of the nuclei by a high - salt treatment , implying that hyper - acetylation facilitates the release of chromatin fibers from the compact heterochromatin regions .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	linker histone h1 became thinner upon acetylation .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	in the afm images , the gyration radius of the nucleosomal fiber became larger after acetylation , suggesting that the acetylation increases long - range repulsive interactions between nucleosomes .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	based on these data , we consider a simple coarse grained model , which explains that acetylation of histone - tails induces chromatin de - compaction by altering the electric charge distribution in nucleosomes .
731b26ceffb7b60b94ca8ded21a774e46b2e8eca	the basic mechanisms of ion transport and energy transduction are supposed to be the same in all p - type at - pases .

1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	there is limited data about patients with end - stage renal disease who also suffer from covid-19 .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	in this report , we discuss the case of a hemodialysis patient who developed covid-19 pneumonia in the clinical course .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	patient concerns : a 79-year - old man who had end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) and was taking regular hemodialysis was admitted to hospital for a fever and dry cough .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	the patient , who also had cardiovascular disease , had no history of contact with covid-2019 patients .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	the patient was diagnosed with covid-2019 by the reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) , and his pharyngeal swab for sars - cov-2 was positive .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	he was treated with oxygen , broadspectrum antibiotics , antiviral drugs , and methylprednisolone .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	outcomes : after 19 days , an rt - pcr assay for sars - cov-2 was negative , and computed tomography ( ct ) of the patient 's thorax indicated that the pulmonary inflammatory exudation was absorbed and pulmonary infection improved significantly .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	he was discharged on day 29 after recovering from covid-2019 pneumonia .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	the courses of disease and treatment options for this individual were significantly more complicated than those for ordinary patients .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	therefore , it was necessary to monitor the condition of the patient closely and to protect the dialysis unit staff from being infected .
1139b8e0b5b8e9b26aebb23c1fabd4d252a05c31	compared with other severe covid-2019 cases , this patient recovered more quickly following treatment , which was likely due to the removal of inflammatory mediators by crrt .

e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	the unyvero hospitalized pneumonia ( hpn , curetis ) test is a multiplex pcr ( m - pcr ) system detecting 21 bacteria and 19 resistance genes on respiratory samples within 5 h.
e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	in this prospective study , we performed a m - pcr on bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) or plugged telescoping catheter ( ptc ) samples of patients with ventilated hap or vap with gram - negative bacilli or clustered gram - positive cocci .
e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	this study was conducted in 3 icus in a french academic hospital : the medical and infectious diseases icu , the surgical icu , and the cardio - surgical icu .
e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	we analyzed 95 clinical samples of ventilated hap or vap ( 72 bal and 23 ptc ) from 85 patients ( 62 males , median age 64 years ) .
e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	a total of 90/112 bacteria were detected by the m - pcr system with a global sensitivity of 80 % ( 95 % ci , 73 - 88 % ) and specificity of 99 % ( 95 % ci 99 - 100 ) .
e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	moreover , 5/8 extended - spectrum beta - lactamases ( ctx - m gene ) and 4/4 carbapenemases genes ( 3 ndm , one oxa-48 ) were detected .
e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	the m - pcr could have led to the earlier initiation of an effective antibiotic in 20/95 patients ( 21 % ) and to early de - escalation in 37 patients ( 39 % ) but could also have led to one ( 1 % ) inadequate antimicrobial therapy .
e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	the m - pcr also led to 2 unexpected diagnosis of severe legionellosis confirmed by culture methods .
e6bd09643d0d59a94af159d7ba1e8746ba653566	conclusions : our results suggest that the use of a m - pcr system for respiratory samples of patients with vap and ventilated hap could improve empirical antimicrobial therapy and reduce the use of broad - spectrum antibiotics .

53633e0dad6b1d750f45e9ff280c78075267f731	the emergence and reemergence of coronavirus epidemics sparked renewed concerns from global epidemiology researchers and public health administrators .

d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	nitric oxide is an important molecule playing a key role in a broad range of biological process such as neurotransmission , vasodilatation and immune responses .
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	while the anti - microbiological properties of nitric oxide - derived reactive nitrogen intermediates ( rni ) such as peroxynitrite , are known , the mechanism of these effects are as yet poorly studied .
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) belongs to the family coronaviridae , was first identified during 2002 - 2003 .
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	mortality in sars patients ranges from between 6 to 55 % .
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	we have previously shown that nitric oxide inhibits the replication cycle of sars - cov in vitro by an unknown mechanism .
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	in this study , we have further investigated the mechanism of the inhibition process of nitric oxide against sars -
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	we found that peroxynitrite , an intermediate product of nitric oxide in solution formed by the reaction of no with superoxide , has no effect on the replication cycle of sars - cov , suggesting that the inhibition is either directly effected by no or a derivative other than peroxynitrite .
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	most interestingly , we found that no inhibits the replication of sars - cov by two distinct mechanisms .
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	angiotensin converting enzyme 2 .
d081f552145f323c7a81808f5f61bca4ce2b9cff	secondly , no or its derivatives cause a reduction in viral rna production in the early steps of viral replication , and this could possibly be due to an effect on one or both of the cysteine proteases encoded in orf1a of sars - cov.
c8e9fe46a5fe98d7cd224f08cfe79dc5ec518380	recent research suggests that sars - cov-2-infected individuals can be highly infectious while 23 asymptomatic or pre - symptomatic , and that an infected person may infect 5.6 other individuals 24 on average .
c8e9fe46a5fe98d7cd224f08cfe79dc5ec518380	this situation highlights the need for rapid , sensitive sars - cov-2 diagnostic assays 25 capable of high - throughput operation that can preferably utilize existing equipment to facilitate 26 broad , large - scale screening efforts .
c8e9fe46a5fe98d7cd224f08cfe79dc5ec518380	this assay utilizes a custom crispr cas12a / grna complex and a fluorescent 28 probe to amplify target amplicons produced by standard rt - pcr or isothermal recombinase 29 polymerase amplification ( rpa ) , to allow sensitive detection at sites not equipped with real - time 30 pcr systems required for qpcr diagnostics .
c8e9fe46a5fe98d7cd224f08cfe79dc5ec518380	we found this approach allowed sensitive and 31 robust detection of sars - cov-2 positive samples , with a sample - to - answer time of ~ 50 min , 32 and a limit of detection of 2 copies per sample .
c8e9fe46a5fe98d7cd224f08cfe79dc5ec518380	crispr assay diagnostic results obtained nasal 33 swab samples of individuals with suspected covid-19 cases were comparable to paired results 34 from a cdc - approved qpcr assay performed in a state testing lab , and superior to those 35 produced by same assay in a clinical lab , where the qpcr assay exhibited multiple invalid or 36 inconclusive results .
c8e9fe46a5fe98d7cd224f08cfe79dc5ec518380	based on these 38 findings , we believe that a crispr - based fluorescent application has potential to improve 39 current covid-19 screening efforts .

e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	responses by resident cells are likely to play a key role in determining the severity of respiratory disease .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	however , sampling of the airways poses a significant challenge , particularly in infants and children .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	here , we report a reliable method for obtaining nasal epithelial cell rna from infants for genome - wide transcriptomic analysis , and describe baseline expression characteristics in an asymptomatic cohort .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	nasal epithelial cells were collected by brushing of the inferior turbinates , and gene expression was interrogated by rna - seq analysis .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	we observed high expression of epithelial cell markers and similarity to the transcriptome for intrapulmonary airway epithelial cells .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	the greatest gene expression differences in this asymptomatic cohort were associated with the presence of known pathogenic viruses and/or bacteria .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	in summary , we have developed a reliable method for interrogating the infant airway transcriptome by sampling the nasal epithelium .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	sampling of the airway for research or diagnostic biospecimens in diseased infants is highly challenging .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	as compared to the tremendous progress made over the last decades in our understanding of adult lung diseases such as copd and lung fibrosis 1 - 3 , this limitation has restricted progress in identifying the molecular mechanisms contributing to pediatric respiratory diseases .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	many contemporary studies sample the upper airway , using aspirates of tracheal secretions in intubated subjects to collect intra - airway inflammatory cells and sloughed resident cells of the airway .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	furthermore , the ability of these samples to reliably capture the cellular and molecular state of the lung is unclear .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	other studies have analyzed nasal washings , which can be performed in a more broad population .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	again , these samples are of unclear relevance to the pathophysiology of the lung .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	brushings of nasal epithelial cells have been used for decades to diagnose primary ciliary dyskenesis ( pcd ) , indicating that recovery of epithelial cells from the nose of non - acutely ill children and infants could provide molecular information that reflects abnormalities of physiological relevance in the distal airway .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	furthermore , nasal brushings in adults and older pediatric patients have previously been used for interrogation of the transcriptome .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	these studies have generally shown that nasal brushings broadly capture gene expression with relevance to the airways 4 , and can detect disease - associated changes in gene expression 5 .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	we undertook the present study to determine if the recovery of nasal epithelial cells for transcriptomic analysis was feasible , and whether these data could provide molecular information of relevance to the more distal airways .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	we present a reliable procedure for sampling resident cells of the airway in healthy young infants , which is applicable to infants experiencing respiratory infectious disease ( t. mariani , unpublished observations ) , and likely to older ill and healthy pediatric subjects .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	furthermore , we provide a benchmark healthy infant nasal transcriptome ( hint ) data set , describing baseline expression and natural variation , for asymptomatic subjects .
e44632c9b598cac15ccda521e13c65ca9fcf7426	our data demonstrates that it is technically feasible to quantify genome - wide rna expression from young infant 's airways , which may be helpful in the evaluation of host responses to diseased states .

15e8cce1354f03cfd5e4ebc04988539203c2c869	blastp analysis showed high homology of the sars - cov-2 envelope protein with 12 consecutive amino acids of the protein lytr c , which is a consensus protein unique to mycobacteria .
15e8cce1354f03cfd5e4ebc04988539203c2c869	six additional cases of human tuberculosis with few organisms showed that the viral envelope specific antibody ( 5/6 ) was more accurate than the afb stain ( 2/6 ) for diagnostic purposes .
15e8cce1354f03cfd5e4ebc04988539203c2c869	these data indicate bcg vaccination induces a specific immunity against sars cov-2 that targets the viral envelope protein that is essential for infectivity .
15e8cce1354f03cfd5e4ebc04988539203c2c869	thus , a concurrent booster or first use of the bcg vaccine may reduce the severity of the current covid-19 pandemic .
15e8cce1354f03cfd5e4ebc04988539203c2c869	the data also suggests the value of using the sars - cov-2 envelope antibody in the diagnosis of mycobacterial infections in formalin fixed , paraffin embedded tissues by the diagnostic pathologist .

5341fd2caa821b2616a8bc85763a608b29cb4947	this review will focus on three particular areas : the origins and evolution of mers - cov , the challenges and achievements in the development of mers - cov animal models , and our understanding of how novel proteins unique to mers - cov counter the host immune response .
5341fd2caa821b2616a8bc85763a608b29cb4947	the origins of mers - cov , likely in african bats , are increasingly clear , although important questions remain about the establishment of dromedary camels as a reservoir seeding human outbreaks .
5341fd2caa821b2616a8bc85763a608b29cb4947	likewise , there have been important advances in the development of animal models , and both non - human primate and mouse models that seem to recapitulate human disease are now available .
5341fd2caa821b2616a8bc85763a608b29cb4947	how mers - cov evades and inhibits the host innate immune response remains less clear .
5341fd2caa821b2616a8bc85763a608b29cb4947	although several studies have identified mers - cov proteins as innate immune antagonists , little of this work has been conducted using live virus under conditions of actual infection , but rather with ectopically expressed proteins .
5341fd2caa821b2616a8bc85763a608b29cb4947	accordingly , considerable space remains for major contributions to understanding unique ways in which mers - cov interacts with and modulates the host response .

5a815db2c347491145586595b88020c8da78072e	the existence of truncated traces in event logs and their negative impacts on process mining outcomes have been widely acknowledged in the literature .
5a815db2c347491145586595b88020c8da78072e	we benchmark 5 ttc implementations that use either lstm or xgboost on 13 real - life event logs .

e410c19e6a2e6987ea3f8e8a5ca9cd4c26e2456d	sars - cov-2 , resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome , with high potential of spreading and infecting humans worldwide .
e410c19e6a2e6987ea3f8e8a5ca9cd4c26e2456d	since january 2020 , when the virus was identified in humans , the literature on covid-19 has grown exponentially , and extra respiratory symptoms including neurological symptoms are increasingly highlighted .
e410c19e6a2e6987ea3f8e8a5ca9cd4c26e2456d	these neurological disorders are grouped into several categories , ranging from non - specific and moderate symptoms such as headache , myalgia and hyposmia to severe symptoms including cerebrovascular disease and intracranial infections .
e410c19e6a2e6987ea3f8e8a5ca9cd4c26e2456d	severe neurological symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease occur only in a minority of patients with usual risk factor , and are associated with poor outcome .
e410c19e6a2e6987ea3f8e8a5ca9cd4c26e2456d	however , most covid-19 patients exhibit only minor or mild neurological symptoms .
e410c19e6a2e6987ea3f8e8a5ca9cd4c26e2456d	given the high and increasing number of publications reporting neurological involvements of sars - cov-2 , we think providing an update for neurological complications of covid-19 could be useful for physician and especially young trainees in neurology and neurosurgery .
e410c19e6a2e6987ea3f8e8a5ca9cd4c26e2456d	indeed , in this review we discuss several neurological aspects reported in the literature to date , including the evidence and pathways of the neuro - invasion in covid-19 , and the main neurological disorders reported in the literature to date , as well as the future perspectives and the potential long term consequence of current neuro - infection in covid-19 patients .
ca485a95e548643d62c8720b214fccb6ded0ff16	the novel coronavirus disease 2019 has rapidly spread across the globe , overwhelming healthcare systems and depleting resources .
ca485a95e548643d62c8720b214fccb6ded0ff16	we sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of covid-19 patients .
ca485a95e548643d62c8720b214fccb6ded0ff16	we conducted a multi - center retrospective study of positively confirmed covid-19 patients from multiple hospitals in louisiana .
ca485a95e548643d62c8720b214fccb6ded0ff16	secondary outcomes were intensive care unit ( icu ) admission , risk of intubation , duration of mechanical ventilation , and length of hospital stay .
ca485a95e548643d62c8720b214fccb6ded0ff16	a total of 502 covid-19 patients ( 72 asthma and 430 non - asthma cohorts ) were included in the study .
ca485a95e548643d62c8720b214fccb6ded0ff16	the frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3 % , higher than the national prevalence of asthma ( 7.7 % ) .
ca485a95e548643d62c8720b214fccb6ded0ff16	univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese ( 75 % vs 54.2 % , p=0.001 ) , with higher frequency of intubation ( 40.3 % vs 27.8 % , p = 0.036 ) , and required longer duration of hospitalization ( 15.1±12.5 vs 11.5±10.6 , p=0.015 ) .
730362ab32e7aa1b2cd0d097dfc1f6a3f0098e34	all fifty u.s. states and the district of columbia implemented social distancing measures that interrupted transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov-2 ) and reduced morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 .

730362ab32e7aa1b2cd0d097dfc1f6a3f0098e34	explanatory variables included time in days , implementation period ( 1 - 21 days prior to first relaxation of any statewide social distancing measure vs. time from relaxation through may 28 , 2020 ) , and a time - by - period product term .
730362ab32e7aa1b2cd0d097dfc1f6a3f0098e34	relaxation of u.s. statewide social distancing measures was associated with a subsequent reversal of an earlier downward trend in transmission of sars - cov-2 , particularly in states with less active epidemics at the time of relaxation .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	coronaviruses express a multifunctional papain - like protease , termed plp2 .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	plp2 acts as 17 a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein , and a deubiquitinating ( dub ) enzyme which 18 removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin - conjugated proteins .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	previous in vitro studies 19 implicated plp2 dub activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon ( ifn ) response , but 20 the role of dub activity during virus infection was unknown .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	we engineered a dub mutation ( asp1772 to ala ) into a murine coronavirus 24 and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the dub mutant virus ( dubmut ) in cultured 25 macrophages and in mice .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	we found that the dubmut virus replicates similarly as the wild - type 26 virus in cultured cells , but the dubmut virus activates an ifn response at earlier times compared 27 to the wild - type virus infection in macrophages , consistent with dub activity negatively 28 regulating the ifn response .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	we compared the pathogenesis of the dubmut virus to the wild - type 29 virus and found that the dubmut - infected mice had a statistically significant reduction ( p<0.05 ) 30 in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post - infection , albeit both wild - type and dubmut virus 31 infections resulted in similar liver pathology .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	overall , this study demonstrates that structure - guided 32 mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of plp2-ubiquitin complex , and that 33 plp2 dub activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	the coronavirus papain - like protease 2 ( plp2 ) domain possesses protease activity , 38 all rights reserved .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	we found that mutating 42 the ubiquitin - binding residues results in a plp2 that has reduced dub activity but retains protease 43 activity .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	we engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the dub mutant and showed 44 that the dub mutant virus activated an earlier type
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	i interferon response in macrophages and 45 exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	the results of this study demonstrate that plp2 / dub is 46 an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	47 48 coronaviruses ( covs ) are members of the order nidovirales , which includes enveloped viruses 49 with large ( ~30 kb ) , positive - sense single - stranded rna genomes that yield a characteristic nested 50 set of subgenomic mrnas during replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells ( 1 , 2 ) .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	the genome 51 organization for coronaviruses is highly conserved , with the 5'-most two - thirds of the genome 52 encoding the replicase polyprotein , followed by sequences encoding the canonical structural 53 proteins : spike , envelope , membrane , and nucleocapsid .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	although these accessory genes 55 are not necessarily required for virus replication and are , in general , not highly conserved within 56 the virus family , many encode proteins that regulate the host response ( 3 ) .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	interestingly , 57 coronavirus replicase proteins , which are highly conserved , can also act as antagonists to block or 58 delay the host innate immune response to infection ( 1 , 4 - 8 ) .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	that a slew of coronavirus - encoded 59 accessory and non - accessory proteins have been shown to shape the host antiviral response 60

3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	coronavirus proteases are essential for viral replication as they are responsible for processing 64 the replicase polyprotein ( 2,(9)(10)(11 ) .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	murine coronavirus mhv encodes three proteases : two 65 papain - like proteases ( plp1 and plp2 ) and
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	mhv plp2 is similar to the single papain - like protease ( termed plpro ) of severe acute 67 respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov ) and middle east respiratory syndrome 68 coronavirus ( mers - cov ) ( 9 , 12 - 16 ) .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	we and others have revealed that plp2 or plpro of 69 multiple coronaviruses , including mhv , are multifunctional , not only capable of cleaving the viral 70 polyprotein but also possessing deubiquitinase ( dub ) and deisgylating ( de - conjugating isg15
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	however , it has been challenging 72 to study the effects of a mutated dub on virus replication and pathogenesis because the protease 73 and dub activities share the same catalytic site , disruption of which is lethal for virus replication .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	therefore , it was necessary for us to identify residue(s ) within the mhv protease /
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	in this report , we describe the x - ray structure - guided identification of such residues 77 and evaluate the replication , ifn antagonistic effect , and pathogenesis of a recombinant dub 78 mutant mhv .

3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	x - ray structural studies of sars - and mers - cov papain - like protease / dubs co-85 crystalized with ubiquitin modified at the c - terminus with a covalent warhead ( aldehyde , 3-bromo- 86 propylamine , or propargylamine ) allowed for identification of residues that are important for direct 87 interaction with ubiquitin ( 17 , 18 , 20 ) .
3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3	here , we took a slightly different approach and mutated the 88 catalytic cysteine ( c1716 ) of mhv plp2 to a serine residue and co - crystallized it with free 89 ubiquitin .
